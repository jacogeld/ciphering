ACCOUNTANCY
ACCOUNTANCY OR ACCOUNTING IS THE JOB OF SHARING FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT A BUSINESS TO MANAGERS AND SHAREHOLDERS PEOPLE WHO HAVE INVESTED IN THE BUSINESS. ACCOUNTING IS OFTEN CALLED THE LANGUAGE OF BUSINESS. ACCOUNTANTS ARE PEOPLE WHO DO ACCOUNTING AND ALSO CARRY OUT THE AUDITING OR CHECKING OF A COMPANY S BOOKS AND RECORDS. IN BRITAIN THIS AUDITING IS OFTEN CARRIED OUT BY A QUALIFIED PERSON CALLED A CHARTERED ACCOUNTANT.
WHEN ACCOUNTANTS DO ACCOUNTING WORK THEY WRITE IN THE BOOKS OF ACCOUNT LEDGERS THAT BELONG TO A COMPANY. EVERY TIME MONEY IS SPENT OR EARNED IT IS WRITTEN IN THE LEDGER. THE INFORMATION IN THE LEDGER IS USED TO PREPARE THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS MONTHLY QUARTERLY EVERY THREE MONTHS AND ANNUALLY EVERY YEAR. THESE ANNUAL ACCOUNTS SHOW WHAT MONEY THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN IN OVER TIME AND WHAT IT HAS SPENT MONEY ON. IT ALSO SHOWS IF THE COMPANY MADE A PROFIT IN THE YEAR IF IT MADE MORE MONEY THAN IT SPENT WHO OWES THE COMPANY MONEY WHO THE COMPANY OWES MONEY TO AND ANY BIG EXPENSIVE ITEMS THE COMPANY HAS BOUGHT WHICH THEY EXPECT TO USE FOR MANY YEARS. LENDERS MANAGERS INVESTORS TAX AUTHORITIES THE PEOPLE WHO COLLECT TAXES FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND OTHER DECISION MAKERS LOOK AT THESE ANNUAL ACCOUNTS. MANAGERS AND INVESTORS LOOK AT THE LEDGER AND MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO SPEND MONEY IN THE FUTURE. LENDERS LIKE BANKS LOOK AT THE ACCOUNTS BEFORE THEY LEND MONEY TO THE COMPANY. TAX AUTHORITIES LOOK AT THEM TO CHECK THAT THE COMPANY IS PAYING THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF TAXES.
THE WORD ACCOUNTANT ORIGINALLY COMES FROM THE LATIN WORD COMPUTARE TO RECKON COUNT NUMBER VIA FRENCH.
ACCOMPTANT WAS THE ORIGINAL SPELLING AND PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD ACCOUNTANT. HOWEVER OVER TIME PEOPLE BEGAN TO DROP THE P IN THE WORD ACCOMPTANT. OVER TIME THE WORD CHANGED BOTH IN THE WAY IT WAS SAID AND SPELLED TO HOW IT IS TODAY.
THE BASIC ACCOUNTING EQUATION IS ASSETS LIABILITIES EQUITY.
ACCOUNTANCY IS VERY OLD. IT STARTED WHEN HUMANS FIRST STARTED TO FARM AND FORM TOWNS AND CITIES. PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT ABOUT ECONOMICS KEEPING TRACK OF MONEY AND VALUABLE THINGS THOUGHT OF A WAY TO WRITE DOWN THE SIZES AND VALUES OF CROPS.
THE EARLIEST ACCOUNTING RECORDS WERE FOUND AMONG THE RUINS OF ANCIENT BABYLON ASSYRIA AND SUMERIA WHICH ARE MORE THAN 7 000 YEARS OLD. THE PEOPLE OF THAT TIME RELIED ON PRIMITIVE ACCOUNTING METHODS TO RECORD THE GROWTH OF CROPS AND HERDS. BECAUSE THERE IS A NATURAL SEASON FOR FARMING AND HERDING IT IS EASY TO COUNT AND DETERMINE IF A SURPLUS HAD BEEN GAINED AFTER THE CROPS HAD BEEN HARVESTED OR THE YOUNG ANIMALS WEANED.
THE INVENTION OF A FORM OF BOOKKEEPING USING CLAY TOKENS REPRESENTED A HUGE COGNITIVE LEAP FOR MANKIND.
IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY A.D. THE ARAB WRITER IBN TAYMIYYAH WROTE A BOOK CALLED HISBA. THIS BOOK HAS DETAILS ABOUT ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS THAT WERE USED BY MUSLIMS BEFORE THE MID SEVENTH CENTURY A.D. MUSLIM ACCOUNTING WAS INFLUENCED CHANGED BY ROMANS AND PERSIANS. IN HIS BOOK IBN TAYMIYYAH GIVES DETAILS OF A COMPLEX GOVERNMENTAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.
THE RES GESTAE DIVI AUGUSTI LATIN THE DEEDS OF THE DIVINE AUGUSTUS IS A REMARKABLE ACCOUNT TO THE ROMAN PEOPLE OF THE EMPEROR AUGUSTUS STEWARDSHIP. IT LISTED AND QUANTIFIED HIS PUBLIC EXPENDITURE WHICH ENCOMPASSED DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE PEOPLE GRANTS OF LAND OR MONEY TO ARMY VETERANS SUBSIDIES TO THE AERARIUM TREASURY BUILDING OF TEMPLES RELIGIOUS OFFERINGS AND EXPENDITURES ON THEATRICAL SHOWS AND GLADIATORIAL GAMES. IT WAS NOT AN ACCOUNT OF STATE REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE BUT WAS DESIGNED TO DEMONSTRATE AUGUSTUS MUNIFICENCE. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RES GESTAE DIVI AUGUSTI FROM AN ACCOUNTING PERSPECTIVE LIES IN THE FACT THAT IT ILLUSTRATES THAT THE EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY HAD ACCESS TO DETAILED FINANCIAL INFORMATION COVERING A PERIOD OF SOME FORTY YEARS WHICH WAS STILL RETRIEVABLE AFTER THE EVENT. THE SCOPE OF THE ACCOUNTING INFORMATION AT THE EMPEROR S DISPOSAL SUGGESTS THAT ITS PURPOSE ENCOMPASSED PLANNING AND DECISION MAKING.
THE ROMAN HISTORIANS SUETONIUS AND CASSIUS DIO RECORD THAT IN 23 BC AUGUSTUS PREPARED A RATIONARIUM ACCOUNT WHICH LISTED PUBLIC REVENUES THE AMOUNTS OF CASH IN THE AERARIUM TREASURY IN THE PROVINCIAL FISCI TAX OFFICIALS AND IN THE HANDS OF THE PUBLICANI PUBLIC CONTRACTORS AND THAT IT INCLUDED THE NAMES OF THE FREEDMEN AND SLAVES FROM WHOM A DETAILED ACCOUNT COULD BE OBTAINED. THE CLOSENESS OF THIS INFORMATION TO THE EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY OF THE EMPEROR IS ATTESTED BY TACITUS STATEMENT THAT IT WAS WRITTEN OUT BY AUGUSTUS HIMSELF. 
RECORDS OF CASH COMMODITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WERE KEPT SCRUPULOUSLY BY MILITARY PERSONNEL OF THE ROMAN ARMY. AN ACCOUNT OF SMALL CASH SUMS RECEIVED OVER A FEW DAYS AT THE FORT OF VINDOLANDA CIRCA 110 CE SHOWS THAT THE FORT COULD COMPUTE REVENUES IN CASH ON A DAILY BASIS PERHAPS FROM SALES OF SURPLUS SUPPLIES OR GOODS MANUFACTURED IN THE CAMP ITEMS DISPENSED TO SLAVES SUCH AS CERVESA BEER AND CLAVI CALIGARES NAILS FOR BOOTS AS WELL AS COMMODITIES BOUGHT BY INDIVIDUAL SOLDIERS. THE BASIC NEEDS OF THE FORT WERE MET BY A MIXTURE OF DIRECT PRODUCTION PURCHASE AND REQUISITION IN ONE LETTER A REQUEST FOR MONEY TO BUY 5 000 MODII MEASURES OF BRACES A CEREAL USED IN BREWING SHOWS THAT THE FORT BOUGHT PROVISIONS FOR A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE.
THE HERONINOS ARCHIVE IS THE NAME GIVEN TO A HUGE COLLECTION OF PAPYRUS DOCUMENTS MOSTLY LETTERS BUT ALSO INCLUDING A FAIR NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS WHICH COME FROM ROMAN EGYPT IN 3RD CENTURY CE. THE BULK OF THE DOCUMENTS RELATE TO THE RUNNING OF A LARGE PRIVATE ESTATE IS NAMED AFTER HERONINOS BECAUSE HE WAS PHRONTISTES KOINE GREEK MANAGER OF THE ESTATE WHICH HAD A COMPLEX AND STANDARISED SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTING WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY ALL ITS LOCAL FARM MANAGERS. EACH ADMINISTRATOR ON EACH SUB DIVISION OF THE ESTATE DREW UP HIS OWN LITTLE ACCOUNTS FOR THE DAY TO DAY RUNNING OF THE ESTATE PAYMENT OF THE WORKFORCE PRODUCTION OF CROPS THE SALE OF PRODUCE THE USE OF ANIMALS AND GENERAL EXPENDITURE ON THE STAFF. THIS INFORMATION WAS THEN SUMMARIZED AS PIECES OF PAPYRUS SCROLL INTO ONE BIG YEARLY ACCOUNT FOR EACH PARTICULAR SUB DIVISION OF THE ESTATE. ENTRIES WERE ARRANGED BY SECTOR WITH CASH EXPENSES AND GAINS EXTRAPOLATED FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT SECTORS. ACCOUNTS OF THIS KIND GAVE THE OWNER THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE BETTER ECONOMIC DECISIONS BECAUSE THE INFORMATION WAS PURPOSEFULLY SELECTED AND ARRANGED.
LUCA PACIOLI 1445 1517 ALSO KNOWN AS FRIAR LUCA DAL BORGO IS SAID TO BE THE FATHER OF ACCOUNTANCY. HE WROTE A TEXTBOOK IN LATIN CALLED SUMMA DE ARITHMETICA GEOMETRICA PROPORTIONI ET PROPORTIONALITA SUMMA ON ARITHMETIC GEOMETRY PROPORTIONS AND PROPORTIONALITY VENICE 1494. THIS TEXTBOOK WAS USED IN THE ABBACO SCHOOLS IN NORTHERN ITALY. SONS OF MERCHANTS AND CRAFTSMEN WERE TAUGHT IN THESE SCHOOLS. THIS TEXTBOOK WAS WRITTEN ABOUT MATH. IT HAS THE FIRST PRINTED DESCRIPTION OF HOW MERCHANTS FROM VENICE KEPT THEIR ACCOUNTS. MERCHANTS FROM VENICE USED A SYSTEM CALLED THE DOUBLE ENTRY BOOKKEEPING SYSTEM.
DOUBLE ENTRY BOOKKEEPING IS WHERE THERE IS A DEBIT AND CREDIT ENTRY FOR EVERY TRANSACTION.
PACIOLI WROTE DOWN THIS SYSTEM BUT HE DID NOT INVENT IT BUT HE IS STILL CALLED THE FATHER OF ACCOUNTING. THE SYSTEM HE WROTE HAD MOST OF THE ACCOUNTING CYCLE AS IT IS KNOWN TODAY. HE WROTE ABOUT USING JOURNALS AND LEDGERS AND WARNED THAT A PERSON SHOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT UNTIL THE DEBITS WERE THE SAME AS THE CREDITS. HIS LEDGER HAD ACCOUNTS FOR ASSETS THINGS THAT HAVE VALUE LIABILITIES DEBTS AND LOANS THAT ARE TO BE PAID TO SOMEONE ELSE CAPITAL MONEY INCOME AND EXPENSES. HE SHOWED HOW TO WRITE YEAR END CLOSING ENTRIES AND SUGGESTED THAT A TRIAL BALANCE BE USED TO PROVE THAT A LEDGER IS BALANCED. HIS TREATISE LONG ESSAY IN THE BOOK ALSO HAS INFO ABOUT OTHER TOPICS SUCH AS ACCOUNTING ETHICS AND COST ACCOUNTING.
THE FIRST BOOK WRITTEN IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ON ACCOUNTING WAS PUBLISHED IN LONDON ENGLAND BY JOHN GOUGE IN 1543.
IN 1588 JOHN MELLIS FROM SOUTHWARK ENGLAND WROTE A SHORT BOOK OF INSTRUCTIONS FOR KEEPING ACCOUNTS.
THERE WAS ANOTHER BOOK WRITTEN IN 1635 THAT WAS DESCRIBED AS THE MERCHANTS MIRROUR OR DIRECTIONS FOR THE PERFECT ORDERING AND KEEPING OF HIS ACCOUNTS FORMED BY WAY OF DEBITOR AND CREDITOR. THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN BY RICHARD DAFFORNE WHO WAS AN ACCOUNTANT. THIS BOOK HAS MANY REFERENCES TO BOOKS ABOUT ACCOUNTANCY THAT WERE WRITTEN MUCH EARLIER. ONE CHAPTER OF THIS BOOK IS TITLED OPINION OF BOOK KEEPING S ANTIQUITY. IN THIS CHAPTER THE AUTHOR SAYS THAT ACCORDING TO ANOTHER AUTHOR THE BOOKKEEPING HE WROTE ABOUT WAS USED TWO HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER IN VENICE.
THERE WERE SEVERAL EDITIONS OF RICHARD DAFFORNE S BOOK. THE SECOND EDITION WAS PUBLISHED IN 1636. THE THIRD EDITION WAS PUBLISHED IN 1656. ANOTHER EDITION WAS PUBLISHED IN 1684. THE BOOK IS VERY COMPLETE IN HOW IT DESCRIBES SCIENTIFIC ACCOUNTANCY. IT CONTAINS A LOT OF DETAIL AND EXPLANATION. THE SCIENCE THAT SUPPORTS ACCOUNTANCY WAS LIKED BY MANY PEOPLE IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT THERE WERE SO MANY EDITIONS. STARTING AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY THERE HAVE BEEN MANY BOOKS WRITTEN ABOUT ACCOUNTANCY. MANY AUTHORS CLAIM TO BE PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS AND TEACHERS OF ACCOUNTANCY. BECAUSE OF THIS IT SHOWS THAT THERE WERE PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS WHO WERE EMPLOYED IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.
A FINANCIAL AUDIT IS WHERE AN INTERNAL AUDIT AND AN EXTERNAL AUDIT ARE DONE. FOR AN EXTERNAL AUDIT AN INDEPENDENT UNRELATED AUDITOR TAKES A LOOK AT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOUNTING RECORDS. BY LOOKING AT THESE RECORDS THE AUDITOR CAN FIND OUT IF THESE RECORDS ARE TRUE FAIR AND FOLLOW GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GAAP OR INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS IFRS. INTERNAL AUDIT TRIES TO GET INFO FOR MANAGEMENT USAGE AND IS DONE BY EMPLOYEES.
AFRICA
AFRICA IS THE SECOND LARGEST CONTINENT IN THE WORLD. IT MAKES UP ABOUT A FIFTH OF THE WORLD S LAND. IT IS SURROUNDED BY LARGE AREAS OF WATER. THERE ARE 54 FULLY RECOGNISED AND INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES IN AFRICA AND 14.7 1.216 BILLION OF THE WORLD S POPULATION LIVES THERE. IT IS THOUGHT TO BE THE CONTINENT WHERE THE FIRST HUMANS EVOLVED.
THE HISTORY OF AFRICA BEGINS FROM THE FIRST MODERN HUMAN BEINGS AND LEADS TO ITS PRESENT DIFFICULT STATE AS A POLITICALLY DEVELOPING CONTINENT.
AFRICA S ANCIENT HISTORIC PERIOD INCLUDES THE RISE OF EGYPTIAN CIVILIZATION THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIETIES OUTSIDE THE NILE RIVER VALLEY AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THEM AND CIVILIZATIONS OUTSIDE OF AFRICA. IN THE LATE 7TH CENTURY NORTH AND EAST AFRICA WERE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY THE SPREAD OF ISLAM. THAT LED TO THE APPEARANCE OF NEW CULTURES SUCH AS THOSE OF THE SWAHILI PEOPLE AND THE MALI EMPIRE WHOSE KING MUSA KEITA I BECAME ONE OF THE RICHEST AND MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE OF THE EARLY 14TH CENTURY. THIS ALSO LED TO AN INCREASE IN THE SLAVE TRADE THAT HAD A VERY BAD INFLUENCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WHOLE CONTINENT UNTIL THE 19TH CENTURY.
SLAVERY HAS LONG BEEN PRACTISED IN AFRICA. BETWEEN THE SEVENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURIES THE ARAB SLAVE TRADE TOOK 18 MILLION SLAVES FROM AFRICA VIA TRANS SAHARAN AND INDIAN OCEAN ROUTES.
BETWEEN THE FIFTEENTH AND THE NINETEENTH CENTURIES 500 YEARS THE ATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE TOOK AN ESTIMATED 7 12 MILLION SLAVES TO THE NEW WORLD.
BETWEEN 1808 AND 1860 THE BRITISH NAVY CAPTURED APPROXIMATELY 1 600 SLAVE SHIPS AND FREED 150 000 AFRICANS WHO WERE ABOARD.
IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE EUROPEAN POWERS OCCUPIED MUCH OF THE CONTINENT CREATING MANY COLONIAL AND DEPENDENT TERRITORIES. THEY LEFT ONLY TWO FULLY INDEPENDENT STATES ETHIOPIA KNOWN TO EUROPEANS AS ABYSSINIA AND LIBERIA.
EGYPT AND SUDAN WERE NEVER FORMALLY INCORPORATED INTO ANY EUROPEAN COLONIAL EMPIRE. HOWEVER AFTER THE BRITISH OCCUPATION OF 1882 EGYPT WAS EFFECTIVELY UNDER BRITISH ADMINISTRATION UNTIL 1922.
AFRICAN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENTS HAD THEIR FIRST SUCCESS IN 1951 WHEN LIBYA BECAME THE FIRST FORMER COLONY TO BECOME INDEPENDENT. MODERN AFRICAN HISTORY HAS BEEN FULL OF REVOLUTIONS AND WARS AS WELL AS THE GROWTH OF MODERN AFRICAN ECONOMIES AND DEMOCRATIZATION ACROSS THE CONTINENT.
A CIVIL WAR IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO FORMERLY ZAIRE BEGAN IN 1998. NEIGHBOURING AFRICAN COUNTRIES HAVE BECOME INVOLVED. SINCE THE CONFLICT BEGAN 5 5 MILLION ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF IT.
POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS SUCH AS THE AFRICAN UNION OFFER HOPE FOR GREATER CO OPERATION AND PEACE BETWEEN THE CONTINENT S MANY COUNTRIES.
FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AFRICA HAS MOST TYPES OF CLIMATE. IN SEQUENCE FROM THE NORTH 
RUNNING NORTH EAST TO THE SOUTH IS THE EAST AFRICAN GREAT RIFT VALLEY. THIS HAS MOUNTAINS VOLCANOES DEEP RIFTS AND VALLEYS RIVERS AND LAKES.
IN FACT AFRICA HAS EXAMPLES OF MOST OF THE EARTH S CLIMATE TYPES.
MUCH OF NORTH AFRICA IS DRY AND HOT IT IS DOMINATED BY THE SAHARA DESERT AND DOES NOT RECEIVE MUCH RAIN. IN SAHARAN AFRICA THERE ARE FEW RIVERS OR OTHER WATER SOURCES. UNDERGROUND WATER SOURCES SUCH AS SPRINGS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE DESERT. THESE OFTEN FORM OASES. AN OASIS IS AN AREA OF VEGETATION PLANT LIFE SURROUNDED BY DESERT.
IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD THE WIND COMES MOSTLY FROM THE EAST. THAT DOES BRING RAIN BUT THE HIMALAYAS AND THE TIBETAN PLATEAU BLOCKS THE MONSOON RAIN AND PREVENTS IT GETTING TO NORTH AFRICA. ALSO THE ATLAS MOUNTAINS NEAR THE NORTH COAST
OF AFRICA PREVENT RAIN FROM COMING IN FROM THE NORTH. THAT IS ANOTHER RAIN SHADOW.
THESE TWO RAIN SHADOWS ARE MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAHARA DESERT.
CONDITIONS AND WINDS ARE DIFFERENT FURTHER SOUTH WHERE HUGE AMOUNTS OF RAIN FALLS NEAR THE EQUATOR. THE EQUATOR RUNS ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF AFRICA SEE RED LINE DRAWN ON MAP. THAT MEANS MUCH OF AFRICA IS BETWEEN THE TWO TROPICS 
AFRICA HAS A LOT OF WILDLIFE. THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF ANIMALS THERE. IN PARTICULAR IT IS NOW THE ONLY CONTINENT THAT HAS MANY NATIVE SPECIES OF LARGE MAMMALS. SOME OF THEM OCCUR IN VERY LARGE NUMBERS. THERE ARE ANTELOPE BUFFALO ZEBRA CHEETAH ELEPHANT LION GIRAFFE RHINOCEROS APES HYAENA AND A LOT MORE. OVER 2 000 TYPES OF FISH LIVE IN AFRICAN LAKES AND RIVERS.
THE AFRICAN UNION AU IS AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION. IT AIMS TO TRANSFORM THE AFRICAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY A FEDERATED COMMONWEALTH INTO A STATE UNDER ESTABLISHED INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS. THE AFRICAN UNION HAS A PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT KNOWN AS THE AFRICAN UNION GOVERNMENT CONSISTING OF LEGISLATIVE JUDICIAL AND EXECUTIVE ORGANS. IT IS LED BY THE AFRICAN UNION PRESIDENT AND HEAD OF STATE WHO IS ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE PAN AFRICAN PARLIAMENT. A PERSON BECOMES PRESIDENT OF THE AU BY BEING ELECTED TO THE PAP AND THEN GAINING MAJORITY SUPPORT IN THE PAP.
EXTENSIVE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES STILL OCCUR IN SEVERAL PARTS OF AFRICA OFTEN UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE. MOST OF SUCH VIOLATIONS OCCUR FOR POLITICAL REASONS OFTEN AS A SIDE EFFECT OF CIVIL WAR. COUNTRIES WHERE MAJOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN RECENT TIMES INCLUDE UGANDA SIERRA LEONE LIBERIA SUDAN ZIMBABWE AND C TE D IVOIRE.
PEOPLE WHO COME FROM AFRICA ARE CALLED AFRICANS. PEOPLE NORTH OF THE SAHARA ARE CALLED MAGHREBIS AND PEOPLE ON THE SOUTH ARE CALLED SUBSAHARANS. LANGUAGES IN EASTERN AFRICA INCLUDE SWAHILI OROMO AND AMHARIC. LANGUAGES IN WESTERN AFRICA INCLUDE LINGALA IGBO AND FULANI. THE MOST POPULATED COUNTRY IN AFRICA IS NIGERIA.
COUNTRIES WITH SIGNIFICANT AFRICAN DESCENDENTS OUTSIDE AFRICA 
AIR CONDITIONER
AN AIR CONDITIONER IS A SYSTEM OR A MACHINE THAT TREATS AIR IN A DEFINED USUALLY ENCLOSED AREA VIA A REFRIGERATION CYCLE IN WHICH WARM AIR IS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH COOLER AND MORE HUMID AIR. 
IN CONSTRUCTION A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF HEATING VENTILATION AND AIR CONDITIONING IS REFERRED TO AS HVAC. WHETHER IN HOMES OFFICES OR VEHICLES ITS PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE COMFORT BY ALTERING THE PROPERTIES OF THE AIR USUALLY BY COOLING THE AIR INSIDE.THE MAIN FUNCTION OF AIR CONDITIONER IS TO CHANGE ADVERSE TEMPERATURE 
THE 19TH CENTURY BRITISH SCIENTIST AND INVENTOR MICHAEL FARADAY DISCOVERED THAT COMPRESSING AND LIQUEFYING AMMONIA COULD CHILL AIR WHEN THE LIQUEFIED AMMONIA WAS ALLOWED TO EVAPORATE. 
IN 1842 PHILIPPINES PHYSICIAN DR. JOHN GORRIE USED COMPRESSOR TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE ICE WHICH HE USED TO COOL AIR FOR HIS PATIENTS. HE HOPED EVENTUALLY TO USE HIS ICE MAKING MACHINE TO REGULATE THE TEMPERATURE OF BUILDINGS AND EVEN CONSIDERED COOLING ENTIRE CITIES WITH A SYSTEM OF CENTRALIZED AIR CONDITIONING UNITS.
AIR CONDITIONING ENGINEERS BROADLY DIVIDE AIR CONDITIONING APPLICATIONS INTO COMFORT AND PROCESS. 
COMFORT APPLICATIONS AIM TO PROVIDE AN INDOOR ENVIRONMENT THAT REMAINS RELATIVELY CONSTANT IN A RANGE PREFERRED BY HUMANS DESPITE CHANGES IN EXTERNAL WEATHER CONDITIONS OR IN INTERNAL HEAT LOADS. 
PROCESS APPLICATIONS AIM TO PROVIDE A SUITABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR AN INDUSTRIAL OR A COMMERCIAL PROCESS REGARDLESS OF INTERNAL HEAT LOADS AND EXTERNAL WEATHER CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH OFTEN IN THE SAME COMFORT RANGE IT IS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROCESS THAT DETERMINES CONDITIONS NOT HUMAN PREFERENCE. PROCESS APPLICATIONS INCLUDE 
OTHER EXAMPLES INCLUDE 
IN BOTH COMFORT AND PROCESS APPLICATIONS THE OBJECTIVE IS NOT ONLY TO CONTROL TEMPERATURE ALTHOUGH IN SOME COMFORT APPLICATIONS THIS IS ALL THAT IS CONTROLLED BUT ALSO FACTORS LIKE HUMIDITY AIR MOVEMENT AND AIR QUALITY.
IN THE REFRIGERATION CYCLE A PUMP TRANSFERS HEAT FROM A LOWER TEMPERATURE SOURCE INTO A HIGHER TEMPERATURE HEAT SINK. HEAT WILL NATURALLY FLOW IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THIS IS THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF AIR CONDITIONING. 
A REFRIGERATED AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM WORKS IN MUCH THE SAME WAY PUMPING HEAT OUT OF THE ROOM IN WHICH IT STANDS.
THIS CYCLE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE UNIVERSAL GAS LAW PV NRT WHERE P IS PRESSURE V IS VOLUME R IS THE UNIVERSAL GAS CONSTANT T IS TEMPERATURE AND N IS THE NUMBER OF MOLECULES OF GAS 1 MOLE 6.022 10 MOLECULES.
THE MOST COMMON REFRIGERATION CYCLE USES AN ELECTRIC MOTOR TO DRIVE A COMPRESSOR. IN AN AUTOMOBILE THE COMPRESSOR IS DRIVEN BY A PULLEY ON THE ENGINE S CRANKSHAFT WITH BOTH USING ELECTRIC MOTORS FOR AIR CIRCULATION. SINCE EVAPORATION OCCURS WHEN HEAT IS ABSORBED AND CONDENSATION OCCURS WHEN HEAT IS RELEASED AIR CONDITIONERS ARE DESIGNED TO USE A COMPRESSOR TO CAUSE PRESSURE CHANGES BETWEEN TWO COMPARTMENTS AND ACTIVELY PUMP A COOLANT AROUND AN ENCLOSED SYSTEM. THE COOLING LIQUID OR REFRIGERANT IS PUMPED INTO THE COOLED COMPARTMENT THE EVAPORATOR COIL. LOW PRESSURE THEN CAUSES THE REFRIGERANT TO EVAPORATE TAKING THE HEAT WITH IT. IN THE OTHER COMPARTMENT THE CONDENSER THE REFRIGERANT VAPOUR IS COMPRESSED AND FORCED THROUGH ANOTHER HEAT EXCHANGE COIL CONDENSED INTO A LIQUID WHICH THEN REJECTS THE HEAT PREVIOUSLY ABSORBED FROM THE COOLED SPACE.
AIR CONDITIONING HAS AS MUCH INFLUENCE ON HUMAN HEALTH AS ANY GENERIC HEATING SYSTEM.POORLY MAINTAINED AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS ESPECIALLY LARGE CENTRALIZED SYSTEMS CAN OCCASIONALLY PROMOTE THE GROWTH AND SPREAD OF MICROORGANISMS SUCH AS LEGIONELLA PNEUMOPHILA THE INFECTIOUS AGENT RESPONSIBLE FOR LEGIONNAIRE S DISEASE. AIR CONDITIONING CAN HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON SUFFERERS OF ALLERGIES AND ASTHMA.
IN SERIOUS HEAT WAVES AIR CONDITIONING CAN SAVE THE LIVES OF THE ELDERLY. SOME LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE EVEN SET UP PUBLIC COOLING CENTERS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONING AT HOME.
ALGEBRA
ALGEBRA IS A PART OF MATHEMATICS OFTEN CALLED MATH IN THE UNITED STATES AND MATHS OR NUMERACY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. IT USES VARIABLES TO REPRESENT A VALUE THAT IS NOT YET KNOWN. WHEN AN EQUALS SIGN IS USED THIS IS CALLED AN EQUATION. A VERY SIMPLE EQUATION USING A VARIABLE IS 2 3 X IN THIS EXAMPLE X 5 OR IT COULD ALSO BE SAID X EQUALS FIVE. THIS IS CALLED SOLVING FOR X. 
BESIDES EQUATIONS THERE ARE INEQUALITIES LESS THAN AND GREATER THAN. A SPECIAL TYPE OF EQUATION IS CALLED THE FUNCTION. THIS IS OFTEN USED IN MAKING GRAPHS.
ALGEBRA CAN BE USED TO SOLVE REAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE RULES OF ALGEBRA WORK IN REAL LIFE AND NUMBERS CAN BE USED TO REPRESENT THE VALUES OF REAL THINGS. PHYSICS ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER PROGRAMMING ARE AREAS THAT USE ALGEBRA ALL THE TIME. IT IS ALSO USEFUL TO KNOW IN SURVEYING CONSTRUCTION AND BUSINESS ESPECIALLY ACCOUNTING.
PEOPLE WHO DO ALGEBRA NEED TO KNOW THE RULES OF NUMBERS AND MATHEMATIC OPERATIONS USED ON NUMBERS STARTING WITH ADDING SUBTRACTING MULTIPLYING AND DIVIDING. MORE ADVANCED OPERATIONS INVOLVE EXPONENTS STARTING WITH SQUARES AND SQUARE ROOTS. INTERESTINGLY MANY OF THESE RULES CAN ALSO BE USED ON THE VARIABLES.
ALGEBRA WAS FIRST USED TO SOLVE EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES. TWO EXAMPLES ARE LINEAR EQUATIONS THE EQUATION OF A LINE Y MX B AND QUADRATIC EQUATIONS WHICH HAS VARIABLES THAT ARE SQUARED POWER OF TWO A NUMBER THAT IS MULTIPLIED BY ITSELF FOR EXAMPLE 2 2 3 3 X X. HOW TO FACTOR POLYNOMIALS IS NEEDED FOR QUADRATIC EQUATIONS.
EARLY FORMS OF ALGEBRA WERE DEVELOPED BY THE BABYLONIANS AND THE GREEKS. HOWEVER THE WORD ALGEBRA IS A LATIN FORM OF THE ARABIC WORD AL JABR CASTING AND COMES FROM A MATHEMATICS BOOK AL MAQALA FI HISAB AL JABR WA AL MUQABILAH ESSAY ON THE COMPUTATION OF CASTING AND EQUATION WRITTEN IN THE 9TH CENTURY BY A PERSIAN MATHEMATICIAN MUHAMMAD IBN M S AL KHW RIZM WHO WAS A MUSLIM BORN IN KHWARIZM IN UZBEKISTAN. HE FLOURISHED UNDER AL MA MOUN IN BAGHDAD IRAQ THROUGH 813 833 AD AND DIED AROUND 840 AD. THE BOOK WAS BROUGHT INTO EUROPE AND TRANSLATED INTO LATIN IN THE 12TH CENTURY. THE BOOK WAS THEN GIVEN THE NAME ALGEBRA. THE ENDING OF THE MATHEMATICIAN S NAME AL KHWARIZMI WAS CHANGED INTO A WORD EASIER TO SAY IN LATIN AND BECAME THE ENGLISH WORD ALGORITHM.
HERE IS A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF AN ALGEBRA PROBLEM 
THESE ARE THE STEPS YOU CAN USE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM 
WITH PRACTICE ALGEBRA CAN BE USED WHEN FACED WITH A PROBLEM THAT IS TOO HARD TO SOLVE ANY OTHER WAY. PROBLEMS SUCH AS BUILDING A FREEWAY DESIGNING A CELL PHONE OR FINDING THE CURE FOR A DISEASE ALL REQUIRE ALGEBRA.
AS IN MOST PARTS OF MATHEMATICS ADDING Z TO Y OR Y PLUS Z IS WRITTEN AS Y Z.
SUBTRACTING Z FROM Y OR Y MINUS Z IS WRITTEN AS Y Z.
DIVIDING Y BY Z OR Y OVER Z FORMULA 1 IS WRITTEN AS Y Z OR Y Z. Y Z IS MORE COMMONLY USED.
IN ALGEBRA MULTIPLYING Y BY Z OR Y TIMES Z CAN BE WRITTEN IN 4 WAYS Y Z Y Z Y Z OR JUST YZ. THE MULTIPLICATION SYMBOL IS USUALLY NOT USED BECAUSE IT LOOKS TOO MUCH LIKE THE LETTER X WHICH IS OFTEN USED AS A VARIABLE. ALSO WHEN MULTIPLYING A LARGER EXPRESSION PARENTHESES CAN BE USED Y Z 1.
WHEN WE MULTIPLY A NUMBER AND A LETTER IN ALGEBRA WE WRITE THE NUMBER IN FRONT OF THE LETTER 5 Y 5 Y. WHEN THE NUMBER IS 1 THEN THE 1 IS NOT WRITTEN BECAUSE 1 TIMES ANY NUMBER IS THAT NUMBER 1 Y Y AND SO IT IS NOT NEEDED.
AS A SIDE NOTE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE THE LETTERS X OR Y IN ALGEBRA. VARIABLES ARE JUST SYMBOLS THAT MEAN SOME UNKNOWN NUMBER OR VALUE SO YOU CAN USE ANY VARIABLE. X AND Y ARE THE MOST COMMON THOUGH.
AN IMPORTANT PART OF ALGEBRA IS THE STUDY OF FUNCTIONS SINCE FUNCTIONS OFTEN APPEAR IN EQUATIONS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE. A FUNCTION IS LIKE A BOX YOU CAN PUT A NUMBER OR NUMBERS INTO AND GET A CERTAIN NUMBER OUT. WHEN USING FUNCTIONS GRAPHS CAN BE POWERFUL TOOLS IN HELPING US TO STUDY THE SOLUTIONS TO EQUATIONS. 
A GRAPH IS A PICTURE THAT SHOWS ALL THE VALUES OF THE VARIABLES THAT MAKE THE EQUATION OR INEQUALITY TRUE. USUALLY THIS IS EASY TO MAKE WHEN THERE ARE ONLY ONE OR TWO VARIABLES. THE GRAPH IS OFTEN A LINE AND IF THE LINE DOES NOT BEND OR GO STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN IT CAN BE DESCRIBED BY THE BASIC FORMULA Y MX B. THE VARIABLE B IS THE Y INTERCEPT OF THE GRAPH WHERE THE LINE CROSSES THE VERTICAL AXIS AND M IS THE SLOPE OR STEEPNESS OF THE LINE. THIS FORMULA APPLIES TO THE COORDINATES OF A GRAPH WHERE EACH POINT ON THE LINE IS WRITTEN X Y. 
IN SOME MATH PROBLEMS LIKE THE EQUATION FOR A LINE THERE CAN BE MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE X AND Y IN THIS CASE. TO FIND POINTS ON THE LINE ONE VARIABLE IS CHANGED. THE VARIABLE THAT IS CHANGED IS CALLED THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE. THEN THE MATH IS DONE TO MAKE A NUMBER. THE NUMBER THAT IS MADE IS CALLED THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE. MOST OF THE TIME THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE IS WRITTEN AS X AND THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE IS WRITTEN AS Y FOR EXAMPLE IN Y 3X 1. THIS IS OFTEN PUT ON A GRAPH USING AN X AXIS GOING LEFT AND RIGHT AND A Y AXIS GOING UP AND DOWN. IT CAN ALSO BE WRITTEN IN FUNCTION FORM F X 3X 1. SO IN THIS EXAMPLE WE COULD PUT IN 5 FOR X AND GET Y 16. PUT IN 2 FOR X WOULD GET Y 7. AND 0 FOR X WOULD GET Y 1. SO THERE WOULD BE A LINE GOING THRU THE POINTS 5 16 2 7 AND 0 1 AS SEEN IN THE GRAPH TO THE RIGHT.
IF X HAS A POWER OF 1 IT IS A STRAIGHT LINE. IF IT IS SQUARED OR SOME OTHER POWER IT WILL BE CURVED. IF IT USES AN INEQUALITY THEN USUALLY PART OF THE GRAPH IS SHADED EITHER ABOVE OR BELOW THE LINE.
IN ALGEBRA THERE ARE A FEW RULES THAT CAN BE USED FOR FURTHER UNDERSTANDING OF EQUATIONS. THESE ARE CALLED THE RULES OF ALGEBRA. WHILE THESE RULES MAY SEEM SENSELESS OR OBVIOUS IT IS WISE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE PROPERTIES DO NOT HOLD THROUGHOUT ALL BRANCHES OF MATHEMATICS. THEREFORE IT WILL BE USEFUL TO KNOW HOW THESE AXIOMATIC RULES ARE DECLARED BEFORE TAKING THEM FOR GRANTED. BEFORE GOING ON TO THE RULES REFLECT ON TWO DEFINITIONS THAT WILL BE GIVEN.
COMMUTATIVE MEANS THAT A FUNCTION HAS THE SAME RESULT IF THE NUMBERS ARE SWAPPED AROUND. IN OTHER WORDS THE ORDER OF THE TERMS IN AN EQUATION DO NOT MATTER. WHEN THE OPERATOR OF TWO TERMS IS AN ADDITION THE COMMUTATIVE PROPERTY OF ADDITION IS APPLICABLE. IN ALGEBRAIC TERMS THIS GIVES FORMULA 6.
NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT APPLY FOR SUBTRACTION I.E. FORMULA 7 
WHEN THE OPERATOR OF TWO TERMS IS AN MULTIPLICATION THE COMMUTATIVE PROPERTY OF MULTIPLICATION IS APPLICABLE. IN ALGEBRAIC TERMS THIS GIVES FORMULA 8.
NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT APPLY FOR DIVISION I.E. FORMULA 9 WHEN FORMULA 10 
ASSOCIATIVE REFERS TO THE GROUPING OF NUMBERS. THE ASSOCIATIVE PROPERTY OF ADDITION IMPLIES THAT WHEN ADDING THREE OR MORE TERMS IT DOESN T MATTER HOW THESE TERMS ARE GROUPED. ALGEBRAICALLY THIS GIVES FORMULA 11. NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT HOLD FOR SUBTRACTION E.G. FORMULA 12 SEE THE DISTRIBUTIVE PROPERTY.
THE ASSOCIATIVE PROPERTY OF MULTIPLICATION IMPLIES THAT WHEN MULTIPLYING THREE OR MORE TERMS IT DOESN T MATTER HOW THESE TERMS ARE GROUPED. ALGEBRAICALLY THIS GIVES FORMULA 13. NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT HOLD FOR DIVISION E.G. FORMULA 14.
THE DISTRIBUTIVE PROPERTY STATES THAT THE MULTIPLICATION OF A NUMBER BY ANOTHER TERM CAN BE DISTRIBUTED. FOR INSTANCE FORMULA 15. DO NOT CONFUSE THIS WITH THE ASSOCIATIVE PROPERTIES FOR INSTANCE FORMULA 16. 
IDENTITY REFERS TO THE PROPERTY OF A NUMBER THAT IT IS EQUAL TO ITSELF. IN OTHER WORDS THERE EXISTS AN OPERATION OF TWO NUMBERS SO THAT IT EQUALS THE VARIABLE OF THE SUM. THE ADDITIVE IDENTITY PROPERTY STATES THAT THE SUM OF ANY NUMBER AND 0 IS THAT NUMBER FORMULA 17. THIS ALSO HOLDS FOR SUBTRACTION FORMULA 18.
THE MULTIPLICATIVE IDENTITY PROPERTY STATES THAT THE PRODUCT OF ANY NUMBER AND 1 IS THAT NUMBER FORMULA 19. THIS ALSO HOLDS FOR DIVISION FORMULA 20.
THE ADDITIVE INVERSE PROPERTY IS SOMEWHAT LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF THE ADDITIVE IDENTITY PROPERTY. WHEN AN OPERATION IS THE SUM OF A NUMBER AND ITS OPPOSITE AND IT EQUALS 0 THAT OPERATION IS A VALID ALGEBRAIC OPERATION. ALGEBRAICALLY IT STATES THE FOLLOWING FORMULA 21. ADDITIVE INVERSE OF 1 IS 1.
THE MULTIPLICATIVE INVERSE PROPERTY ENTAILS THAT WHEN AN OPERATION IS THE PRODUCT OF A NUMBER AND ITS RECIPROCAL AND IT EQUALS 1 THAT OPERATION IS A VALID ALGEBRAIC OPERATION. ALGEBRAICALLY IT STATES THE FOLLOWING FORMULA 22. MULTIPLICATIVE INVERSE OF 2 IS 1 2.
IN ADDITION TO ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA OR BASIC ALGEBRA THERE ARE ADVANCED FORMS OF ALGEBRA TAUGHT IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES SUCH AS ABSTRACT ALGEBRA LINEAR ALGEBRA AND UNIVERSAL ALGEBRA. 
THIS INCLUDES HOW TO USE A MATRIX TO SOLVE MANY LINEAR EQUATIONS AT ONCE. ABSTRACT ALGEBRA IS THE STUDY OF THINGS THAT ARE FOUND IN EQUATIONS GOING BEYOND NUMBERS TO THE MORE ABSTRACT WITH GROUPS OF NUMBERS.
MANY MATH PROBLEMS ARE ABOUT PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING. IN MANY OF THESE PHYSICS PROBLEMS TIME IS A VARIABLE. TIME USES THE LETTER T. USING THE BASIC IDEAS IN ALGEBRA CAN HELP REDUCE A MATH PROBLEM TO ITS SIMPLEST FORM MAKING IT EASIER TO SOLVE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS. ENERGY IS E FORCE IS F MASS IS M ACCELERATION IS A AND SPEED OF LIGHT IS SOMETIMES C. THIS IS USED IN SOME FAMOUS EQUATIONS LIKE F MA AND E MC 2 ALTHOUGH MORE COMPLEX MATH BEYOND ALGEBRA WAS NEEDED TO COME UP WITH THAT LAST EQUATION.
ALGORITHM
AN ALGORITHM IS A FANCY TO DO LIST FOR A COMPUTER. ALGORITHMS TAKE IN ZERO OR MORE INPUTS AND GIVE BACK ONE OR MORE OUTPUTS.
A RECIPE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF AN ALGORITHM BECAUSE IT TELLS YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO DO STEP BY STEP. IT TAKES INPUTS INGREDIENTS AND PRODUCES AN OUTPUT THE COMPLETED DISH.
THE WORDS ALGORITHM AND ALGORISM COME FROM THE NAME OF A PERSIAN MATHEMATICIAN CALLED AL KHW RIZM PERSIAN C. 780 850.
INFORMALLY AN ALGORITHM CAN BE CALLED A LIST OF STEPS. THIS IS NICE BUT IT DOESN T SAY MUCH ABOUT ALGORITHMS.
FORMALLY AN ALGORITHM IS A PRECISE LIST OF OPERATIONS THAT CAN BE DONE BY A TURING MACHINE.
ALGORITHMS CAN BE WRITTEN IN REGULAR ENGLISH BUT IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO DO SO. INSTEAD ALGORITHMS ARE WRITTEN IN PSEUDOCODE FLOW CHARTS OR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES. ALGORITHMS ARE USUALLY MEANT TO BE RUN BY A COMPUTER.
THERE IS USUALLY MORE THAN ONE WAY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. THERE MAY BE MANY DIFFERENT RECIPES TO MAKE A CERTAIN DISH WHICH LOOKS DIFFERENT BUT ENDS UP TASTING THE SAME WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR ALGORITHMS. HOWEVER SOME OF THESE WAYS WILL BE BETTER THAN OTHERS. IF A RECIPE NEEDS LOTS OF COMPLICATED INGREDIENTS THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE IT IS NOT AS A GOOD AS A SIMPLE RECIPE.
WHEN WE LOOK AT ALGORITHMS AS A WAY OF SOLVING PROBLEMS OFTEN WE WANT TO KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE A COMPUTER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM USING A PARTICULAR ALGORITHM. WHEN WE WRITE ALGORITHMS WE LIKE OUR ALGORITHM TO TAKE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME SO THAT WE CAN SOLVE OUR PROBLEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
IN COOKING SOME RECIPES ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO DO THAN OTHERS BECAUSE THEY TAKE MORE TIME TO FINISH OR HAVE MORE THINGS TO KEEP TRACK OF.
IT IS THE SAME FOR ALGORITHMS AND ALGORITHMS ARE BETTER WHEN THEY ARE EASIER FOR THE COMPUTER TO DO. THE THING THAT MEASURES THE DIFFICULTY OF AN ALGORITHM IS CALLED COMPLEXITY. WHEN WE ASK HOW COMPLEX AN ALGORITHM IS OFTEN WE WANT TO KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE A COMPUTER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WE WANT IT TO SOLVE.
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN ALGORITHM FOR SORTING CARDS WITH COLORS ON THEM INTO PILES OF THE SAME COLOR 
THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF ALGORITHMS FOR SORTING A STACK OF CARDS WITH MANY DIFFERENT NUMBERS SO THAT THE NUMBERS ARE IN ORDER.
PLAYERS START WITH A STACK OF CARDS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SORTED.
THIS ALGORITHM GOES THROUGH THE STACK OF CARDS ONE CARD AT A TIME. THIS CARD IS COMPARED TO THE NEXT CARD IN THE STACK. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POSITION ONLY CHANGES IN STEP 6. THIS ALGORITHM IS CALLED BUBBLE SORT. IT IS SLOW.
LET US TAKE A STACK OF THE CARDS WITH THE NUMBERS 5 1 4 2 8 AND SORT IT FROM SMALLEST NUMBER TO BIGGEST ONE USING THIS ALGORITHM. IN EACH STEP THE ALGORITHM COMPARES THE ELEMENTS WRITTEN IN BOLD. THE TOP OF THE STACK OF CARDS IS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE.
FIRST PASS 
5 1 4 2 8 FORMULA 1 1 5 4 2 8 HERE THE ALGORITHM COMPARES THE FIRST TWO ELEMENTS AND SWAPS THEM.
1 4 2 5 8 FORMULA 1 1 4 2 5 8 THESE ELEMENTS ARE ALREADY IN ORDER SO THE ALGORITHM DOES NOT SWAP THEM.
SECOND PASS 
NOW THE STACK OF CARDS IS ALREADY SORTED BUT OUR ALGORITHM DOES NOT KNOW THIS. THE ALGORITHM NEEDS ONE WHOLE PASS WITHOUT ANY SWAP TO KNOW IT IS SORTED.
THIRD PASS 
FINALLY THE ARRAY IS SORTED AND THE ALGORITHM CAN STOP.
THIS IS AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND ALGORITHM FOR SORTING. COMPUTER SCIENTISTS CALLED IT BUBBLE SORT BECAUSE SMALLER ELEMENTS WILL RISE TO THE TOP CHANGING THEIR POSITION IN EACH RUN. UNFORTUNATELY THE ALGORITHM IS NOT VERY GOOD BECAUSE IT NEEDS A LONG TIME MANY PASSES THROUGH THE STACK OF CARDS TO SORT IT.
THIS ALGORITHM USES ANOTHER IDEA. SOMETIMES SOLVING A PROBLEM IS DIFFICULT BUT THE PROBLEM CAN BE CHANGED SO IT IS MADE OF SIMPLER PROBLEMS THAT ARE EASIER TO SOLVE. THIS IS CALLED RECURSION. IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THAN THE FIRST EXAMPLE BUT IT WILL GIVE A BETTER ALGORITHM.
THIS WORKS WITH TWO STACKS OF CARDS. ONE OF THEM IS CALLED A THE OTHER IS CALLED B. THERE IS A THIRD STACK THAT IS EMPTY AT THE START CALLED C. AT THE END IT WILL CONTAIN THE RESULT.
JOHN VON NEUMANN DEVELOPED THIS ALGORITHM IN 1945. HE DID NOT CALL IT SORTING BY NUMBERS HE CALLED IT MERGESORT. IT IS A VERY GOOD ALGORITHM FOR SORTING COMPARED TO OTHERS.
THE FIRST ALGORITHM TAKES MUCH LONGER TO SORT THE CARDS THAN THE SECOND BUT IT CAN BE IMPROVED MADE BETTER. LOOKING AT BUBBLE SORT IT CAN BE NOTICED THAT CARDS WITH HIGH NUMBERS MOVE FROM THE TOP OF THE STACK QUITE QUICKLY BUT CARDS WITH LOW NUMBERS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STACK TAKE A LONG TIME TO RISE MOVE TO THE TOP.
TO IMPROVE THE FIRST ALGORITHM HERE IS THE IDEA 
THIS ALGORITHM WAS DEVELOPED BY C. A. R. HOARE IN 1960. IT IS ONE OF MOST WIDELY USED ALGORITHMS FOR SORTING TODAY. IT IS CALLED QUICKSORT.
IF PLAYERS HAVE CARDS WITH COLORS AND NUMBERS ON THEM THEY CAN SORT THEM BY COLOR AND NUMBER IF THEY DO THE SORTING BY COLORS ALGORITHM THEN DO THE SORTING BY NUMBERS ALGORITHM TO EACH COLORED STACK THEN PUT THE STACKS TOGETHER.
THE SORTING BY NUMBERS ALGORITHMS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO DO THAN THE SORTING BY COLORS ALGORITHM BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE TO DO THE STEPS AGAIN MANY TIMES. ONE WOULD SAY THAT SORTING BY NUMBERS IS MORE COMPLEX.
ALPHABET
AN ALPHABET IS A WRITING SYSTEM A LIST OF SYMBOLS FOR WRITING. THE BASIC SYMBOLS IN AN ALPHABET ARE CALLED LETTERS. IN AN ALPHABET EACH LETTER IS A SYMBOL FOR A SOUND OR RELATED SOUNDS. TO MAKE THE ALPHABET WORK BETTER MORE SIGNS ASSIST THE READER PUNCTUATION MARKS SPACES STANDARD READING DIRECTION AND SO ON.
THE NAME ALPHABET COMES FROM ALEPH AND BETH THE FIRST TWO LETTERS IN THE PHOENICIAN ALPHABET.
THIS ARTICLE IS WRITTEN WITH THE ROMAN ALPHABET OR LATIN ALPHABET. IT WAS FIRST USED IN ANCIENT ROME TO WRITE LATIN. TODAY MANY LANGUAGES ALSO USE THE LATIN ALPHABET IT IS THE MOST USED ALPHABET TODAY.
IT SEEMS THAT THE IDEA OF AN ALPHABET A SCRIPT BASED ENTIRELY UPON SOUND HAS BEEN COPIED AND ADAPTED TO SUIT MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. ALTHOUGH NO ALPHABET FITS ITS LANGUAGE PERFECTLY THEY ARE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO FIT ANY LANGUAGE APPROXIMATELY. THE ALPHABET WAS A UNIQUE INVENTION.
THE ROMAN ALPHABET THE CYRILLIC AND A FEW OTHERS COME FROM THE ANCIENT GREEK ALPHABET WHICH DATES BACK TO ABOUT 1100 TO 800. THE GREEK ALPHABET WAS PROBABLY DEVELOPED FROM THE PHOENICIAN SCRIPT WHICH APPEARED SOMEWHAT EARLIER AND HAD SOME SIMILAR LETTER SHAPES. 
THE PHOENICIANS SPOKE A SEMITIC LANGUAGE USUALLY CALLED CANAANITE. THE SEMITIC GROUP OF LANGUAGES INCLUDES ARABIC MALTESE HEBREW AND ALSO ARAMAIC THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN BY JESUS. WE DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT HOW THE ALPHABETIC IDEA AROSE BUT THE PHOENICIANS A TRADING PEOPLE CAME UP WITH LETTERS WHICH WERE ADAPTED BY THE EARLY GREEKS TO PRODUCE THEIR ALPHABET. THE ONE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE PHOENICIAN SCRIPT HAD NO PURE VOWELS. ARABIC SCRIPT HAS VOWELS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE SHOWN BY DIACRITICS SMALL MARKS ABOVE OR BELOW THE LINE. THE OLDEST QU RAN MANUSCRIPTS HAD NO DIACRITICS. ISRAELI CHILDREN TO ABOUT THE THIRD GRADE USE HEBREW TEXTS WITH VOWEL DOTS ADDED. 
NO ANCIENT SCRIPT ALPHABETIC OR NOT HAD PURE VOWELS BEFORE THE GREEKS. THE GREEK ALPHABET EVEN HAS TWO VOWELS FOR E AND TWO FOR O TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE LONG AND SHORT SOUNDS. IT IS FAIRLY CLEAR FROM THIS THAT CAREFUL THOUGHT WENT INTO BOTH THE PHOENICIAN INVENTION AND THE GREEK ADAPTATION BUT NO DETAILS SURVIVE OF EITHER PROCESS.
SEMITIC SCRIPTS APPARENTLY DERIVE FROM PROTO SINAITIC A SCRIPT OF WHICH ONLY 31 INSCRIPTIONS PLUS 17 DOUBTFUL ARE KNOWN. IT IS THOUGHT BY SOME RESEARCHERS THAT THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THIS SCRIPT WAS THE EGYPTIAN HIERATIC SCRIPT WHICH BY THE LATE MIDDLE KINGDOM ABOUT 1900 HAD ADDED SOME ALPHABETIC SIGNS FOR REPRESENTING THE CONSONANTS OF FOREIGN NAMES. EGYPTIAN ACTIVITY IN SINAI WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AT THAT TIME. A SIMILAR IDEA HAD BEEN SUGGESTED MANY YEARS PREVIOUSLY.
A LIST OF ALPHABETS AND EXAMPLES OF THE LANGUAGES THEY ARE USED FOR 
OTHER WRITING SYSTEMS DO NOT USE LETTERS BUT THEY DO AT LEAST IN PART REPRESENT SOUNDS. FOR EXAMPLE MANY SYSTEMS REPRESENT SYLLABLES. IN THE PAST SUCH WRITING SYSTEMS WERE USED BY MANY CULTURES BUT TODAY THEY ARE ALMOST ONLY USED BY LANGUAGES PEOPLE SPEAK IN ASIA.
ANCIENT EGYPT
ANCIENT EGYPT OR THE EGYPTIAN EMPIRE WAS A SOCIETY THAT BEGAN ABOUT 3150 BC AND LASTED UNTIL 20 BC WHEN IT WAS INVADED BY THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 
EGYPT GREW ALONG THE RIVER NILE AND WAS AT ITS MOST POWERFUL IN THE SECOND MILLENNIUM BC. ITS LAND WENT FROM THE NILE DELTA TO NUBIA A KINGDOM WHICH TODAY IS MOSTLY IN THE SUDAN.
FOR MOST OF ITS HISTORY EGYPT WAS PROSPEROUS SINCE THE WATER FROM THE NILE MADE SURE THAT THE EGYPTIANS WOULD HAVE GOOD CROPS. CROPS WERE GROWN AFTER THE NILE FLOOD WATER WENT DOWN. 
THE EGYPTIANS CREATED A WAY OF WRITING USING HIEROGLYPHS BUILT HUGE TEMPLES AND TOMBS TRADED WITH OTHER AREAS AND HAD A POWERFUL ARMY. THEIR RELIGION HAD MANY GODS AND ITS PRIESTS WERE POWERFUL AND RICH. THEIR RULERS CALLED PHARAOHS WERE THOUGHT TO BE CLOSE TO THE GODS.
ARCHAEOLOGISTS WHO STUDY OBJECTS LEFT BY ANCIENT PEOPLE HAVE FOUND THAT PEOPLE HAVE LIVED ALONG THE NILE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THE FERTILE FLOOD PLAINS OF THE NILE ALLOWED PEOPLE TO BEGIN FARMING. BY THE 10TH MILLENNIUM BC THE PEOPLE IN EGYPT HAD BEGUN GROWING CEREAL GRAINS LIKE WHEAT AND BARLEY. BECAUSE THEY WERE FARMING THEY STAYED IN ONE PLACE AND BECAUSE THEY WERE SETTLED THEIR SOCIETY BECAME MORE COMPLEX. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE HISTORY OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION.
THIS PERIOD IN EGYPTIAN HISTORY IS CALLED PREDYNASTIC AS IT HAPPENED BEFORE THE LARGE DYNASTIC KINGDOMS WERE FORMED.
BY ABOUT 5500 BC SMALL TRIBES LIVING IN THE NILE VALLEY HAD DEVELOPED INTO A SERIES OF CULTURES. EACH HAD BEGUN FARMING CROPS AND ANIMALS. EACH HAD THEIR OWN TYPES OF POTTERY AND PERSONAL ITEMS SUCH AS COMBS BRACELETS AND BEADS. IN UPPER EGYPT THE SOUTH PART OF THE COUNTRY THE BADARIAN WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST CULTURES. IT IS KNOWN FOR ITS HIGH QUALITY POTTERY STONE TOOLS AND ITS USE OF COPPER. THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY THE AMRATIAN AND GERZIAN CULTURES. 
THE DIFFERENT PERIODS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN HISTORY ARE 
THE INTERMEDIATE PERIODS INCLUDED TIMES WHEN THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM BROKE DOWN THE COUNTRY WAS SPLIT OR INVADED BY FOREIGN RULERS. EGYPT S CULTURE AND CLIMATE WAS RELATIVELY STABLE COMPARED TO OTHER PARTS OF THE MIDDLE EAST. NEVERTHELESS THEY HAD SOME PERIODS WHEN THEIR GOVERNMENT WAS CHALLENGED AND SOMETIMES OVERTHROWN.
ANCIENT EGYPT WAS SPLIT UP INTO MANY DIFFERENT DISTRICTS CALLED SEPATS. THE FIRST DIVISIONS WERE CREATED DURING THE PREDYNASTIC PERIOD BUT THEN THEY WERE SMALL CITY STATES THAT RULED THEMSELVES. WHEN THE FIRST PHARAOH CAME TO POWER THE SEPATS REMAINED AND WERE MUCH LIKE THE COUNTIES IN MANY COUNTRIES TODAY. THEY STAYED BASICALLY THE SAME FOR A LONG TIME THERE WERE 42 OF THEM AND EACH WAS RULED BY A GOVERNOR CHOSEN BY THE PHARAOH. IN LATER YEARS THE DISTRICTS WERE CALLED NOMES AND THE GOVERNOR WAS CALLED A NOMARCH.
ANCIENT EGYPT HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT TAXES BUT THERE WAS NO REAL MONEY SO PEOPLE PAID EACH OTHER WITH GOODS OR WORK. THE PERSON WHO WATCHED THE TAX COLLECTION WAS A SCRIBE AND EVERY TAX COLLECTOR IN EGYPT HAD TO TELL HIM EVERY DAY HOW MANY TAXES THEY HAD COLLECTED. EACH PERSON PAID DIFFERENT TAXES BASED ON THE WORK THAT THEY DID CRAFTSMEN PAID IN GOODS HUNTERS AND FISHERMEN PAID WITH FOOD AND EVERY SINGLE HOUSEHOLD IN THE COUNTRY HAD TO PAY A LABOUR TAX EVERY YEAR BY HELPING WITH WORK FOR THE COUNTRY LIKE MINING OR FOR CANALS. A LOT OF RICH EGYPTIANS PAID POORER PEOPLE TO DO THIS FOR THEM.
THE LANGUAGE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO SIX TIME PERIODS 
EGYPT HAD WRITING CALLED HIEROGLYPHICS WHICH IS ONE OF THE TWO OLDEST WRITTEN LANGUAGES THE OTHER IS SUMERIAN CUNEIFORM. 
HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING DATES TO C. 3200 BC AND IS COMPOSED OF SOME 500 SYMBOLS. A HIEROGLYPH CAN REPRESENT A WORD A SOUND OR A SILENT DETERMINATIVE WHICH MAKES CLEAR WHAT THE SIGN MEANS. THE SAME SYMBOL CAN SERVE DIFFERENT PURPOSES IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. HIEROGLYPHS WERE FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES USED ON STONE MONUMENTS AND IN TOMBS. IT WAS ART AND OFTEN IT WAS POLITICAL PROPAGANDA.
THE SCRIPT USED BY PRIESTS FOR EVERYDAY WRITING ON PAPYRUS WOOD OR CLOTH.
IN DAY TO DAY WRITING SCRIBES USED A CURSIVE FORM OF WRITING CALLED HIERATIC WHICH WAS QUICKER AND EASIER. WHILE FORMAL HIEROGLYPHS MAY BE READ IN ROWS OR COLUMNS IN EITHER DIRECTION THOUGH TYPICALLY WRITTEN FROM RIGHT TO LEFT HIERATIC WAS ALWAYS WRITTEN FROM RIGHT TO LEFT USUALLY IN HORIZONTAL ROWS.
THE SCRIPT USED BY ORDINARY PEOPLE. A NEW FORM OF WRITING DEMOTIC BECAME THE MAIN WRITING STYLE. IT IS THIS FORM OF WRITING AND FORMAL HIEROGLYPHS WHICH ACCOMPANIES THE GREEK TEXT ON THE ROSETTA STONE.
THE COPTIC SCRIPT IS A MODIFIED GREEK ALPHABET. THE COPTIC LANGUAGE IS THE LAST STAGE OF THE EGYPTIAN LANGUAGE MODERN EGYPTIANS SPEAK A DIALECT OF ARABIC.
SOME ANCIENT EGYPTIAN LITERATURE HAS SURVIVED TO THE PRESENT DAY. THERE ARE TEACHING TEXTS SUCH AS THE MAXIMS OF PTAHHOTEP THE INSTRUCTIONS OF AMENEMOPE AND THE EBERS PAPYRUS. THE EBERS PAPYRUS IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST MEDICAL TEXTS EVER FOUND.
THERE ARE ALSO POEMS AND STORIES. 
RELIGION WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. TO EGYPTIANS ANIMALS WERE HOLY AND WERE WORSHIPPED. BECAUSE OF THIS EGYPTIANS DOMESTICATED OR MADE PETS OF ANIMALS VERY EARLY AND TOOK VERY GOOD CARE OF THEM. THE CENTRE OF ANY EGYPTIAN TOWN WAS THE TEMPLE AND THIS BUILDING WAS USED FOR EVERYTHING FROM THE TOWN HALL TO A UNIVERSITY IN ADDITION TO ITS RELIGIOUS SERVICES. 
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO RELIGIOUS EGYPTIANS CREATED A LOT OF ART OF THEIR GODS. THIS ART SHOWS ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF DIVINE OR HOLY CREATURES INCLUDING THE PHARAOH WHO WAS THOUGHT TO BE A GOD. 
THE AFTERLIFE WAS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO EGYPTIANS AND THEY ARE KNOWN FOR MUMMIFYING THEIR DEAD. THESE MUMMIES ARE IMPORTANT TO SCIENTISTS TODAY BECAUSE THEY TELL THEM ABOUT HOW THE EGYPTIANS LIVED.
ALL THE GODS WERE IMPORTANT BUT SOME WERE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS. AN EXAMPLE OF A GODDESS IS ISIS WHO IS THE GODDESS OF THE SKY. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A MAJOR GOD IS RA WHO WAS THE GOD OF THE SUN. THE LESS WELL KNOWN GOD OF THE NILE AND THE CROCODILES WAS NAMED SOBEK WHICH IS A RATHER UNUSUAL NAME. BASTET WAS THE GODDESS OF CATS SO THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS MUMMIFIED CATS IN HONOUR OF HER SHE WAS ALSO THE GODDESS OF PROTECTION JOY AND FAMILIES.
THE RICH FERTILE SOIL CAME FROM ANNUAL INUNDATIONS OF THE NILE RIVER. THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS WERE THUS ABLE TO PRODUCE AN ABUNDANCE OF FOOD ALLOWING THE POPULATION TO DEVOTE MORE TIME AND RESOURCES TO CULTURAL TECHNOLOGICAL AND ARTISTIC PURSUITS. IN ANCIENT EGYPT TAXES WERE ASSESSED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF LAND A PERSON OWNED.
FARMING IN EGYPT WAS DEPENDENT ON THE CYCLE OF THE NILE RIVER. THE EGYPTIANS RECOGNIZED THREE SEASONS AKHET FLOODING PERET PLANTING AND SHEMU HARVESTING. THE FLOODING SEASON LASTED FROM JUNE TO SEPTEMBER DEPOSITING ON THE RIVER S BANKS A LAYER OF MINERAL RICH SILT IDEAL FOR GROWING CROPS. AFTER THE FLOODWATERS HAD RECEDED THE GROWING SEASON LASTED FROM OCTOBER TO FEBRUARY. FARMERS PLOWED AND PLANTED SEEDS IN THE FIELDS WHICH WERE IRRIGATED WITH DITCHES AND CANALS. EGYPT RECEIVED LITTLE RAINFALL SO FARMERS RELIED ON THE NILE TO WATER THEIR CROPS. FROM MARCH TO MAY FARMERS USED SICKLES TO HARVEST THEIR CROPS WHICH WERE THEN THRESHED WITH A FLAIL TO SEPARATE THE STRAW FROM THE GRAIN. WINNOWING REMOVED THE CHAFF FROM THE GRAIN AND THE GRAIN WAS THEN GROUND INTO FLOUR BREWED TO MAKE BEER OR STORED FOR LATER USE.
FLAX PLANTS WERE GROWN FOR THE FIBERS OF THEIR STEMS. THESE FIBERS WERE SPLIT ALONG THEIR LENGTH AND SPUN INTO THREAD WHICH WAS USED TO WEAVE SHEETS OF LINEN AND TO MAKE CLOTHING. PAPYRUS GROWING ON THE BANKS OF THE NILE RIVER WAS USED TO MAKE PAPER. VEGETABLES AND FRUITS WERE GROWN IN GARDEN PLOTS CLOSE TO HABITATIONS AND ON HIGHER GROUND AND HAD TO BE WATERED BY HAND. VEGETABLES INCLUDED LEEKS GARLIC MELONS SQUASHES PULSES LETTUCE AND OTHER CROPS IN ADDITION TO GRAPES THAT WERE MADE INTO WINE.
MOST ANIMALS WERE KEPT AS FOOD. SOME ANIMALS WERE KEPT AS PETS. ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS WERE IMPORTANT TO EGYPT. ANCIENT EGYPTIANS UNDERSTOOD THE ANIMALS. ANIMALS THEY KEPT WERE GOATS PIGS DUCKS COWS AND GEESE.
ANCIENT EGYPTIANS HAD SOME ADVANCED MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE FOR THEIR TIME. THEY PERFORMED SURGERY SET BROKEN BONES AND EVEN KNEW ABOUT MEDICINES. SOME MEDICINES THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS USED ARE HONEY AND BREAST MILK OR GAZELLE S MILK. NOT ONLY DID THEY HAVE MEDICINAL VALUES THEY ALSO ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN USED TO WARD OFF EVIL SPIRITS AND DEMONS. THE EASIEST WAY TO SEE HOW GOOD THEY WERE AT MEDICINE IS TO LOOK AT THE MEDICAL PAPYRI WHICH HAVE SURVIVED TO THE PRESENT DAY. THE EDWIN SMITH PAPYRUS IS THE WORLD S OLDEST SURVIVING SURGICAL DOCUMENT FROM ABOUT 1600 B.C. THE TEXT DESCRIBES ANATOMY AND THE EXAMINATION DIAGNOSIS TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS OF 48 TYPES OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS IN DETAIL.
ANCIENT EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS ARE SHAPED STONE MASONRY STRUCTURES. THEY ARE THE BEST KNOWN PYRAMID STRUCTURES AND ARE SOME OF THE LARGEST EVER BUILDINGS. OVER 130 PYRAMIDS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN EGYPT. MOST WERE BUILT ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE RIVER NILE IN DESERT AREAS. EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS ARE OFTEN CONTAIN CHAMBERS AND PASSAGES. THE PYRAMIDS WERE BUILT AS THE BURIAL PLACES OF THE EGYPTIAN KINGS BEFORE THE START OF THE OLD KINGDOM UNTIL THE END OF THE MIDDLE KINGDOM. BECAUSE THE EGYPTIANS KEPT WRITTEN RECORDS WE KNOW ABOUT THE BUILDING OF SOME PYRAMIDS.
THE GREAT PYRAMID AT GIZA IS THE LARGEST AND MOST FAMOUS PYRAMID. IT WAS BUILT FOR PHARAOH KHUFU. IT IS OVER 140 METRES HIGH AND TOOK 20 YEARS TO BUILD. IT IS LISTED AS ONE OF THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD. THE STEP PYRAMID AT SAQQARA IS THE EARLIEST PYRAMID WHICH IS STILL STANDING TODAY. THIS WAS BUILT IN 2630 BC. IT WAS A BURIAL PLACE OF THE PHARAOH DJOSER. THE ARCHITECT OF THE STEP PYRAMID WAS IMHOTEP.
ENGINEERING WAS AN IMPORTANT ACTIVITY IN EGYPT. ENGINEERS WERE ABLE TO MEASURE AND SURVEY THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS. THEY DESIGNED AND MADE THE PYRAMIDS WHICH ARE NEARLY PERFECT GEOMETRICALLY. THEY COULD MAKE CEMENT AND DEVELOPED LARGE IRRIGATION NETWORKS. 
SCIENCE WAS ALSO IMPORTANT. MATHEMATICS WAS USED IN EGYPT AND THE GOLDEN RATIO WAS USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PYRAMIDS.
ANOTHER ABILITY OF THE EGYPTIANS WAS GLASS MAKING. ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE FOUND MANY PIECES OF BEADS JARS FIGURES AND ORNAMENTS IN TOMBS ACROSS THE NATION. IN 2005 THE REMAINS OF AN ANCIENT GLASSMAKING FACTORY WAS FOUND.
ANCIENT GREECE
ANCIENT GREECE WAS A LARGE AREA IN THE NORTHEAST OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA WHERE PEOPLE SPOKE GREEK. IT WAS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE GREECE WE KNOW TODAY. IT WAS THE CIVILIZATION OF GREECE FROM THE ARCHAIC PERIOD OF THE 8TH 6TH CENTURIES BC TO 146 BC. THE PERIOD ENDED WITH THE ROMAN CONQUEST OF GREECE IN THE BATTLE OF CORINTH.
FOR MOST OF THIS TIME THE GREEKS DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE GOVERNMENT OR RULER. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CITY STATES EACH WITH ITS OWN CONSTITUTION. ATHENS SPARTA AND CORINTH ARE EXAMPLES. SOME HAD KINGS AND SOME LIKE ATHENS HAD A FORM OF DEMOCRACY. AS TIME WENT ON THE MOST POWERFUL CITIES COLLECTED OTHER CITIES INTO CONFEDERATIONS KNOWN AS LEAGUES. THIS APPLIED TO MANY OF THE GREEK COLONIES IN ASIA MINOR MOST OF WHICH HAD CLOSE TIES TO ONE OR OTHER OF THE BIG THREE CITIES.
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PERIOD WAS CLASSICAL GREECE WHICH FLOURISHED DURING THE 5TH TO 4TH CENTURIES BC. ATHENIAN LEADERSHIP SUCCESSFULLY REPELLED THE THREAT OF PERSIAN INVASION IN THE GRECO PERSIAN WARS. THE ATHENIAN GOLDEN AGE ENDS WITH THE DEFEAT OF ATHENS AT THE HANDS OF SPARTA IN THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR IN 404 BC.
IN THE LAST HELLENISTIC PERIOD GREECE WAS UNIFIED BY THE CONQUESTS OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT. THE CITY STATES CONTINUED UNDER THE OVERALL INFLUENCE OF MACEDONIA.
GREEK CULTURE HAD A POWERFUL INFLUENCE ON THE ROMAN EMPIRE WHICH CARRIED A VERSION OF IT TO MANY PARTS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION AND EUROPE. IN THIS WAY CLASSICAL GREECE WAS PART OF THE FOUNDATION OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION. GREEK WAS ALSO THE LANGUAGE AND PARTLY THE CULTURE OF THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE.
THE HISTORY OF GREECE WENT THROUGH THESE STAGES 
IN THE 8TH CENTURY B.C. THE GREEKS LEARNED HOW TO READ AND WRITE A SECOND TIME. THEY HAD LOST LITERACY AT THE END OF THE MYCENAEAN CULTURE AS THE MEDITERRANEAN WORLD FELL INTO THE DARK AGES. THE GREEK DARK AGES 1100 BC 750 BC OR BRONZE AGE COLLAPSE IS A PERIOD IN THE HISTORY OF ANCIENT GREECE AND ANATOLIA FROM WHICH THERE ARE NO RECORDS AND FEW ARCHAEOLOGICAL REMAINS.
THE GREEKS LEARNED ABOUT THE ALPHABET FROM ANOTHER ANCIENT PEOPLE THE PHOENICIANS. THEY MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO IT. IN PARTICULAR THE GREEKS INTRODUCED REGULAR LETTERS FOR VOWELS WHICH WAS NECESSARY FOR THEIR LANGUAGE. THEIR ALPHABET WAS IN TURN COPIED BY THE ROMANS AND MUCH OF THE WORLD NOW USES THE ROMAN ALPHABET.
ANCIENT GREECE HAD ONE LANGUAGE AND CULTURE BUT WAS NOT UNIFIED UNTIL 337 BC WHEN MACEDONIA DEFEATED ATHENS AND THEBES. THAT MARKED THE END OF THE CLASSIC PERIOD AND THE START OF THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD. EVEN THEN THE CONQUERED CITIES WERE MERELY JOINED TO PHILIP II OF MACEDON S CORINTHIAN LEAGUE THEY WERE NOT OCCUPIED AND RULED THEMSELVES.
ANCIENT GREECE CONSISTED OF SEVERAL HUNDRED MORE OR LESS INDEPENDENT CITY STATES. THIS WAS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER SOCIETIES WHICH WERE TRIBAL OR KINGDOMS RULING OVER RELATIVELY LARGE TERRITORIES.
UNDOUBTEDLY THE GEOGRAPHY OF GREECE DIVIDED AND SUB DIVIDED BY HILLS MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS CONTRIBUTED TO THE NATURE OF ANCIENT GREECE. ON THE ONE HAND THE ANCIENT GREEKS HAD NO DOUBT THAT THEY WERE ONE PEOPLE THEY HAD THE SAME RELIGION SAME BASIC CULTURE AND SAME LANGUAGE. YET EACH CITY STATE OR POLIS WAS INDEPENDENT UNIFICATION WAS SOMETHING RARELY DISCUSSED BY THE ANCIENT GREEKS. EVEN WHEN DURING THE SECOND PERSIAN INVASION OF GREECE A GROUP OF CITY STATES ALLIED THEMSELVES TO DEFEND GREECE MOST POLEIS REMAINED NEUTRAL AND AFTER THE PERSIAN DEFEAT THE ALLIES QUICKLY RETURNED TO INFIGHTING.
THE MAJOR FEATURES OF THE ANCIENT GREEK POLITICAL SYSTEM WERE 
LATER IN THE CLASSICAL PERIOD THE LEAGUES WERE FEWER AND LARGER AND DOMINATED BY ONE CITY PARTICULARLY ATHENS SPARTA AND THEBES. OFTEN CITIES WOULD BE COMPELLED TO JOIN UNDER THREAT OF WAR OR AS PART OF A PEACE TREATY. AFTER PHILIP II OF MACEDON CONQUERED THE HEARTLANDS OF ANCIENT GREECE HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO ANNEX THE TERRITORY OR UNIFY IT INTO A NEW PROVINCE. HOWEVER HE DID FORCE MOST OF THE CITIES TO JOIN HIS OWN CORINTHIAN LEAGUE.
SOME CITIES WERE DEMOCRATIC SOME WERE ARISTOCRATIC AND SOME WERE MONARCHIES. SOME HAD MANY REVOLUTIONS IN WHICH ONE KIND OF GOVERNMENT REPLACED ANOTHER. ONE FAMOUS GREEK KINGDOM IS MACEDON WHICH BECAME BRIEFLY THE LARGEST EMPIRE THE WORLD HAD SEEN AT THE TIME BY CONQUERING THE PERSIAN EMPIRE INCLUDING ANCIENT EGYPT AND REACHING INTO MODERN DAY INDIA. OTHER FAMOUS KINGDOMS ARE EPIRUS AND THESSALY.
MONARCHIES IN ANCIENT GREECE WERE NOT ABSOLUTE BECAUSE THERE WAS USUALLY A COUNCIL OF OLDER CITIZENS THE SENATE OR IN MACEDONIA THE CONGRESS WHO GAVE ADVICE TO THE KING. THESE MEN WERE NOT ELECTED OR CHOSEN IN A LOTTERY LIKE THEY WERE IN THE DEMOCRATIC CITY STATES.
CITIZENS IN ANCIENT GREECE WERE USUALLY MEN WHO WERE FREE BORN IN THAT CITY. WOMEN SLAVES AND USUALLY RESIDENTS BORN ELSEWHERE DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. DETAILS DIFFERED BETWEEN CITIES. ATHENS IS AN EXAMPLE THE MEN OF ATHENS WERE OF THREE GROUPS CITIZENS METICS RESIDENT ALIENS AND SLAVES. CITIZENS WERE MEN OVER 17 WHOSE FOREBEARS HAD BEEN ATHENIANS FOR THREE GENERATIONS. THEY HAD THE RIGHTS OF FREE MEN AND COULD BE ELECTED ANY OFFICIAL STATE POSITION. OF THE ESTIMATED 150 000 RESIDENTS OF THE CITY STATE OF ATTICA ONLY ABOUT ONE FIFTH HELD THE PRIVILEGE OF CITIZENSHIP. WOMEN WERE NOT CITIZENS IN ATHENS BUT IN SPARTA THEY WERE.
THE NUMBER OF GREEKS GREW AND SOON THEY COULD NOT GROW ENOUGH FOOD FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. WHEN THIS HAPPENED A CITY WOULD SEND PEOPLE OFF TO START A NEW CITY KNOWN AS A COLONY.
BECAUSE THE TERRAIN WAS ROUGH MOST TRAVEL WAS BY SEA. FOR THIS REASON MANY NEW CITIES WERE ESTABLISHED ALONG THE COASTLINE. FIRST NEW CITIES WERE STARTED IN ANATOLIA ASIA MINOR AND LATER ALONG THE BLACK SEA IN CYPRUS IN SOUTHERN ITALY IN SICILY AND AROUND WHAT TODAY IS BENGHAZI IN LIBYA. THEY EVEN STARTED A CITY NAUCRATIS ON THE RIVER NILE IN EGYPT. THE CITIES OF TODAY SYRACUSE NAPLES MARSEILLE AND ISTANBUL STARTED AS THE GREEK CITIES SYRACUSA NEAPOLIS MASSILIA AND BYZANTIUM.
BY THE 6TH CENTURY BC SOME CITIES BECAME MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHERS. THEY WERE CORINTH THEBES SPARTA AND ATHENS.
THE SPARTANS WERE VERY WELL DISCIPLINED SOLDIERS. THEY DEFEATED THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED NEAR THEM AND THOSE PEOPLE HAD TO FARM THE LAND FOR THE SPARTANS. THESE HELOTS HAD TO GIVE THE SPARTANS PART OF THE FOOD THEY GREW AND SO THE SPARTANS DID NOT HAVE TO WORK. INSTEAD THEY LEARNED HOW TO BE BETTER SOLDIERS. THERE WERE NOT MANY SPARTANS BUT THERE WERE MANY HELOTS. SPARTAN MILITARY STRENGTH CONTROLLED THE HELOTS. THE SPARTANS HAD TWO HEREDITARY KINGS WHO LED THEM IN WAR. AT HOME THEY WERE ALSO RULED BY A GROUP OF OLD MEN CALLED THE GEROUSIA THE SENATE.
ATHENS BECAME A DEMOCRACY IN 510 BC. THE MEN CAME TO A PLACE IN THE CENTER OF THE CITY AND DECIDED WHAT TO DO. IT WAS THE FIRST PLACE IN THE WORLD WHERE THE PEOPLE DECIDED WHAT THEIR COUNTRY SHOULD DO. THEY WOULD TALK AND THEN VOTE ON WHAT TO DO AT THE BOULE THE PARLIAMENT. BUT THE WOMEN DID NOT VOTE. ATHENS HAD SLAVES. THESE SLAVES WERE OWNED BY THEIR MASTERS AND COULD BE SOLD TO SOMEONE ELSE. THE ATHENIAN SLAVES WERE LESS FREE THAN THE SPARTAN HELOTS. EVERY YEAR ATHENIAN CITIZENS ELECTED EIGHT GENERALS WHO LED THEM IN WAR.
IN 499 BC THE GREEK CITIES IN ANATOLIA REBELLED. THEY DID NOT WANT PERSIA TO RULE THEM ANYMORE. ATHENS SENT 20 SHIPS TO FIGHT THE PERSIANS ON THE SEA. THE GREEKS IN ANATOLIA WERE DEFEATED. THE PERSIAN KING DARIUS DECIDED TO PUNISH ATHENS. HE SENT SOLDIERS AND SHIPS TO FIGHT ATHENS.
ATHENS ASKED FOR HELP FROM SPARTA. SPARTA WANTED TO HELP BUT COULD NOT THEY HAD A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL AT THAT TIME. ATHENS SENT HER SOLDIERS AGAINST THE PERSIAN SOLDIERS AT THE BATTLE OF MARATHON 490 BC THEY DEFEATED THE PERSIANS. THEN THE HELP FROM SPARTA CAME.
AT THE BATTLE OF THERMOPYLAE THE SPARTANS WERE LED BY LEONIDAS AND RESISTED THE HUGE PERSIAN ARMY. AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS A TRAITOR CALLED EPHIALTES LED THE PERSIANS AROUND THE PASS BEHIND THE GREEK ARMY. REALISING THAT DEFEAT WAS INEVITABLE LEONIDAS RELEASED MANY OF HIS MEN. THOSE WHO STAYED KNEW IT WOULD BE A FIGHT TO THE DEATH. LEONIDES KEPT ELITE HOPLITES FOOT SOLDIERS WHO HAD LIVING SONS AT HOME. THERE WERE ALSO ALLIED THESPIANS AND THEBANS WHO VOLUNTEERED TO STAY.
ON THE THIRD DAY LEONIDAS LED HIS 300 SPARTAN HOPLITES AND THEIR ALLIES AGAINST XERXES AND HIS MIGHTY ARMY. THE SPARTAN LED FORCES FOUGHT THIS PERSIAN FORCE TO THEIR DEATHS IN ORDER TO BLOCK THE PASS LONG ENOUGH TO KEEP XERXES AND HIS ARMY OCCUPIED WHILE THE REST OF THE GREEK ARMY ESCAPED.
AFTER THERMOPYLAE MANY GREEKS WANTED TO GO SOUTH TO THE PELOPONNESE. BECAUSE THE ISTHMUS OF CORINTH THE WAY INTO THE PELOPONNESE IS VERY NARROW MANY WANTED TO FIGHT THE PERSIANS THERE.
ATHENS WAS NORTH OF CORINTH AND SHE HAD A NAVY. ATHENS LEADER THEMISTOCLES WANTED TO FIGHT THE PERSIANS BY THE ISLAND OF SALAMIS. XERXES DECIDED TO SEND HIS FLEET AGAINST THE GREEK FLEET BEFORE THE GREEK SHIPS COULD GO TO THE PELOPONNESE. THE GREEK FLEET DEFEATED THE PERSIANS AT THE BATTLE OF SALAMIS. XERXES THEN WENT HOME WITH MANY OF HIS SOLDIERS BUT A PERSIAN ARMY STAYED IN GREECE. THIS ARMY WAS DEFEATED AT THE BATTLE OF PLATEA IN 479 BC.
AFTER THE PERSIANS WERE DEFEATED AT PLATEA THE SPARTANS DID VERY LITTLE. HOWEVER PERSIA WAS STILL DANGEROUS. ATHENS ASKED THE GREEK CITIES ON THE ISLANDS IN THE AEGEAN AND IN ANATOLIA TO JOIN HER. THESE CITIES AGREED BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF PERSIA. THESE CITIES FORMED THE DELIAN LEAGUE AND ATHENS WAS THEIR LEADER. MANY OF THE CITIES HAD TO PAY ATHENS TRIBUTE MONEY. ATHENS USED THE MONEY TO BUILD MANY SHIPS AND THE PARTHENON. SPARTA WAS STILL STRONG ON LAND BUT ATHENS WAS STRONGER ON THE SEA. SEVERAL TIMES THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN ATHENS AND SPARTA. THEN ATHENS DECIDED TO SEND MANY SHIPS TO SICILY TO FIGHT AGAINST THE CITY SYRACUSE. SPARTA SENT HELP TO SYRACUSE AND ATHENS WAS DEFEATED. NONE OF THE ATHENIAN SHIPS CAME BACK.
NOW SPARTA DECIDED TO BUILD SHIPS TO FIGHT ATHENS. IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR SPARTA TO DEFEAT ATHENS BUT THEN AT THE BATTLE OF AEGOSPOTAMI THE SPARTANS DESTROYED MOST OF ATHENS S SHIPS. THE ATHENIANS USED A HIGHLY ADVANCED TYPE OF SHIP KNOWN AS TRIREMES. THESE HIGHLY ADVANCED BATTLE CRAFT HAD SOPHISTICATED COMBAT SYSTEMS AND WERE PROPELLED BY OARSMEN. ON THE FRONT OF THE TRIREME WAS A LARGE BRONZE RAM. THE TRIREME WOULD ROW ITSELF AT AN ENEMY BOAT VERY FAST AND RAM A HOLE INTO ITS HULL. THIS WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY FOR THE TRIREME TO DESTROY OTHER BOATS. SOMETIMES THE SOLDIERS CALLED HOPLITES ON THE TRIREME WOULD BOARD THE SHIP AND KEEP IT FOR THEIR OWN.
MEN IF NOT WORKING FIGHTING OR DISCUSSING POLITICS COULD AT FESTIVAL TIMES GO TO ANCIENT GREEK THEATRE TO WATCH DRAMAS COMEDIES OR TRAGEDIES. THESE OFTEN INVOLVED POLITICS AND THE GODS OF GREEK MYTHOLOGY. WOMEN WERE NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM IN THE THEATRE MALE ACTORS PLAYED FEMALE ROLES.
WOMEN DID DOMESTIC WORK SUCH AS SPINNING WEAVING CLEANING AND COOKING. THEY WERE NOT INVOLVED IN PUBLIC LIFE OR POLITICS. WOMEN FROM RICH FAMILIES HOWEVER HAD SLAVES TO CARRY OUT DOMESTIC WORK FOR THEM.
THE FAMOUS OLYMPIC GAMES WERE HELD AT OLYMPIA EVERY FOUR YEARS. THEY WERE FOR MEN ONLY AND WOMEN WERE NOT ALLOWED TO ATTEND EVEN AS SPECTATORS. THE SPORTS INCLUDED RUNNING JAVELIN THROWING DISCUS THROWING AND WRESTLING. THE GAMES WERE UNUSUAL BECAUSE THE ATHLETES COULD COME FROM ANY GREEK CITY.
ANOTHER COMPETITION THE HERAEAN GAMES WAS HELD FOR WOMEN. IT WAS ALSO HELD AT OLYMPUS AT A DIFFERENT TIME FROM THE MEN S EVENT.
THE RULES FOR GIRLS IN SPARTA WERE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CITIES. THEY WERE TRAINED IN THE SAME EVENTS AS BOYS BECAUSE SPARTANS BELIEVED THAT STRONG WOMEN WOULD PRODUCE STRONG FUTURE WARRIORS. THEIR GIRL ATHLETES WERE UNMARRIED AND COMPETED NUDE OR WEARING SHORT DRESSES. BOYS WERE ALLOWED TO WATCH THE ATHLETES IN THE HOPES OF CREATING MARRIAGES AND OFFSPRING.
LATER IN THE CLASSICAL PERIOD GIRLS COULD COMPETE IN THE SAME FESTIVALS AS MALES.
ANCIENT ROME
ANCIENT ROME IS THE NAME FOR A CIVILIZATION IN ITALY. IT BEGAN AS A SMALL FARMING COMMUNITY IN THE 8TH CENTURY BC. IT BECAME A CITY AND TOOK THE NAME OF ROMA FROM ITS FOUNDER ROMULUS. IT GREW TO BECOME THE LARGEST EMPIRE IN THE ANCIENT WORLD. IT STARTED AS A KINGDOM THEN BECAME A REPUBLIC THEN AN EMPIRE.
THE ROMAN EMPIRE WAS SO BIG THAT THERE WERE PROBLEMS RULING A TERRITORY WHICH STRETCHED FROM BRITAIN TO THE MIDDLE EAST. IN 293 AD DIOCLETIAN SPLIT THE EMPIRE INTO TWO PARTS. A CENTURY LATER IN 395 AD IT WAS PERMANENTLY SPLIT INTO THE WESTERN ROMAN EMPIRE AND THE EASTERN ROMAN EMPIRE.
THE WESTERN EMPIRE ENDED BECAUSE OF THE GERMANIC TRIBE THE VISIGOTHS IN 476 AD. IN THE 5TH CENTURY AD THE WESTERN PART OF THE EMPIRE SPLIT UP INTO DIFFERENT KINGDOMS. THE EASTERN ROMAN EMPIRE STAYED TOGETHER AS THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE. THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE WAS DEFEATED BY THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE IN 1453.
IF WE REMEMBER THAT ROME WAS FOUNDED IN 753 BC BY ROMULUS THE ANCIENT ROME LASTED MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS UNTIL THE FALL IN 1453 OF THE SECOND ROME AS IS OFTEN CALLED COSTANTINOPOLIS ACTUAL ISTANBUL.
ROMAN CULTURE SPREAD TO WESTERN EUROPE AND THE AREA AROUND THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA. ITS HISTORY STILL HAS A BIG INFLUENCE ON THE WORLD TODAY. FOR EXAMPLE ROMAN IDEAS ABOUT LAWS GOVERNMENT ART LITERATURE AND LANGUAGE ARE IMPORTANT TO EUROPEAN CULTURE. THE ROMAN LANGUAGE LATIN SLOWLY EVOLVED BECOMING MODERN FRENCH SPANISH ITALIAN AND ROMANIAN. LATIN ALSO INFLUENCED MANY OTHER LANGUAGES LIKE ENGLISH.
BEGINNING WITH EMPEROR NERO IN THE FIRST CENTURY AD THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT DID NOT LIKE CHRISTIANITY. AT CERTAIN POINTS IN HISTORY PEOPLE COULD BE PUT TO DEATH BECAUSE THEY WERE CHRISTIANS. UNDER EMPEROR DIOCLETIAN THE PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS BECAME THE STRONGEST. HOWEVER CHRISTIANITY BECAME AN OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED RELIGION IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE UNDER CONSTANTINE I WHO WAS THE NEXT EMPEROR. WITH THE SIGNING OF THE EDICT OF MILAN IN 313 IT QUICKLY BECAME THE BIGGEST RELIGION. THEN IN 391 AD BY AN EDICT OF EMPEROR THEODOSIUS I MADE CHRISTIANITY ROME S OFFICIAL RELIGION.
THE BYZANTINES WERE THREATENED BY THE RISE OF ISLAM WHOSE FOLLOWERS TOOK OVER THE TERRITORIES OF SYRIA ARMENIA AND EGYPT AND SOON THREATENED TO TAKE OVER CONSTANTINOPLE. IN THE NEXT CENTURY THE ARABS ALSO CAPTURED SOUTHERN ITALY AND SICILY.
THE BYZANTINES SURVIVED DURING THE 8TH CENTURY AND BEGINNING IN THE 9TH CENTURY TOOK BACK PARTS OF THE CONQUERED LANDS. IN 1000 AD THE EASTERN EMPIRE WAS AT ITS LARGEST POINT AND CULTURE AND TRADE FLOURISHED. HOWEVER THE EXPANSION WAS SUDDENLY STOPPED IN 1071 AT THE BATTLE OF MANZIKERT. THIS FINALLY MADE THE EMPIRE START BECOMING WEAKER. AFTER CENTURIES OF FIGHTING AND TURKIC INVASIONS EMPEROR ALEXIUS I COMNENUS CALLED FOR HELP FROM THE WEST IN 1095.
THE WEST RESPONDED WITH THE CRUSADES EVENTUALLY RESULTING IN THE FOURTH CRUSADE WHICH CONQUERED CONSTANTINOPLE IN 1204. NEW COUNTRIES INCLUDING NICAEA TOOK PIECES OF THE NOW SMALLER EMPIRE. AFTER THE RECAPTURE OF CONSTANTINOPLE BY IMPERIAL FORCES THE EMPIRE WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A GREEK STATE CONFINED TO THE AEGEAN COAST. THE EASTERN EMPIRE CAME TO AN END WHEN MEHMED II CONQUERED CONSTANTINOPLE ON 29 MAY 1453.
REMAINS OF ROMAN WORK AND ARCHITECTURE HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE FURTHEST CORNERS OF THE LATE EMPIRE.
ANGEL
IN MANY MYTHOLOGIES AND RELIGIONS AN ANGEL IS A GOOD SPIRIT. THE WORD ANGEL COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD ANGELOS WHICH MEANS MESSENGER. ANGELS APPEAR FREQUENTLY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT THE NEW TESTAMENT QUR AN AND AQDAS.
ANGELS ARE POWERFUL SMART SPIRITS THAT OBEY GOD S COMMANDS AND PRAISE HIM WITH SINGING AND THEY HAVE MALE MASCULINE GENDER BUT WITHOUT ANY SEX. THEY SOMETIMES APPEAR TO HUMANS IN HUMAN FORM. THEY CAN DELIVER MESSAGES TO PEOPLE IN PERSON OR IN DREAMS. ANGELS THAT ARE NAMED IN THE BIBLE ARE MICHAEL CALLED A CHIEF PRINCE GABRIEL KNOWN FOR TELLING MARY THAT SHE WOULD BE THE MOTHER OF JESUS AND RAPHAEL IN THE APOCRYPHAL BOOK OF TOBIT. THE ETHIOPIAN BOOK OF ENOCH ALSO LISTS FOUR ARCHANGELS WHICH WATCH OVER THE FOUR QUADRANTS OF HEAVEN MICHAEL RAPHAEL GABRIEL AND URIEL. LUCIFER IS ALSO KNOWN AS AN ANGEL IN THE BIBLE.

THOU HAST BEEN IN EDEN THE GARDEN OF GOD EVERY PRECIOUS STONE WAS THY COVERING THE SARDIUS TOPAZ AND THE DIAMOND THE BERYL THE ONYX AND THE JASPER THE SAPPHIRE THE EMERALD AND THE CARBUNCLE AND GOLD THE WORKMANSHIP OF THY TABRETS AND OF THY PIPES WAS PREPARED IN THEE IN THE DAY THAT THOU WAST CREATED.
14. THOU ART THE ANOINTED CHERUB THAT COVERETH AND I HAVE SET THEE SO THOU WAST UPON THE HOLY MOUNTAIN OF GOD THOU HAST WALKED UP AND DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE STONES OF FIRE.
IT DESCRIBES THE SOUND OF THEIR WINGS LIKE THE ROAR OF RUSHING WATERS. 
EZEKIEL 10 5 7 EZEKIEL 10 8 REVEALS THAT THEY HAVE HANDS LIKE A MAN UNDER THEIR WINGS.
EZEKIEL 1 7 KJV REVEALS THAT THEY LOOK LIKE MAN BUT ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE STRAIGHT FEET AND FOUR WINGS AND FOUR FACES.
EZEKIEL CH 1 AND 10 DESCRIBE THE CHERUBIM CREATURES ASCENDING AND DESCENDING FROM THE EARTH WITH WHEELS. EZEKIEL 1 14 20 EZEKIEL 10 16
EZEKIEL 10 9 13 DESCRIBES WHAT THE WHEELS APPEARED TO LOOK LIKE AND HOW THEY MOVED AROUND HOW THEY MOVED OR FLEW THROUGH THE SKY QUICKLY BUT TURNED NOT AS THEY WENT AND HOW THE INSIDE WORKINGS OF THE WHEELS APPEARED TO BE A WHEEL IN THE MIDST OF A WHEEL AND THAT THE COLOR OF THE WHEELS WAS THE COLOR OF AMBER STONE. THERE ARE FOUR SEPARATE WHEELS IN BOTH ACCOUNTS ONE FOR EACH SINGLE CHERUB WHICH IS THERE.
THEY ARE OFTEN SHOWN IN ART AS HAVING WINGS AND A HALO. THE WINGS REPRESENT THEIR SPEED AND THE HALO REPRESENTS THEIR HOLINESS.
THE CHERUBIM IN ART ALWAYS APPEAR AS BABY FACED ANGELS WITH VERY SMALL NON USEFUL WINGS.
THE CHERUBIM STATUE OR BRONZE CASTING OF CHERUBIM IN THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON DEPICTED THEM AS TWO FOUR WINGED CREATURES WHOSE WINGS TOUCHED AT THE PEAK OF THE ARK THAT THEY WERE MAKING.
THE SAME CHERUBIM CREATURES WERE SAID TO BE CAST IN GOLD ON TOP OF THE ARK OF THE COVENANT. CASTING METAL IS ONE OF THE OLDEST FORMS OF ARTWORK AND WAS ATTEMPTED BY LEONARDO DA VINCI.
THE STUDY OF ANGELS IS CALLED ANGELOLOGY.
ANTARCTICA
ANTARCTICA IS THE EARTH S SOUTHERNMOST CONTINENT. IT IS ON THE SOUTH POLE. IT S ALMOST ENTIRELY SOUTH OF THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE. AROUND ANTARCTICA IS THE SOUTHERN OCEAN. AT 14.0 MILLION KM2 5.4 MILLION SQ MI IT IS THE FIFTH LARGEST CONTINENT IN AREA AFTER ASIA AFRICA NORTH AMERICA AND SOUTH AMERICA. ABOUT 99 OF ANTARCTICA IS COVERED BY ICE. THIS ICE AVERAGES AT LEAST 1.6 KILOMETERS 1.0 MI IN THICKNESS. 
ANTARCTICA ON AVERAGE IS THE COLDEST DRIEST AND WINDIEST CONTINENT. IT IS ALSO THE HIGHEST OF ALL THE CONTINENTS. ANTARCTICA IS CONSIDERED A DESERT. IT HAS YEARLY PRECIPITATION OF ONLY 200 MM 8 INCHES NEAR THE SEA AND FAR LESS INLAND. NO HUMANS LIVE IN ANTARCTICA PERMANENTLY. HOWEVER ABOUT 1 000 TO 5 000 PEOPLE LIVE THROUGH THE YEAR AT THE SCIENCE STATIONS IN ANTARCTICA. ONLY PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT CAN LIVE IN COLD LIVE THERE. THE ANIMALS INCLUDE PENGUINS SEALS NEMATODES TARDIGRADES AND MITES. PLANT LIFE INCLUDES SOME GRASS AND SHRUBS ALGAE LICHEN FUNGI AND BACTERIA.
THE FIRST KNOWN SIGHTING OF THE CONTINENT WAS IN 1820. ANTARCTICA WAS MOSTLY FORGOTTEN FOR THE REST OF THE 19TH CENTURY. THIS WAS BECAUSE OF ITS HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT FEW RESOURCES AND ISOLATION. THE FIRST OFFICIAL USE OF THE NAME ANTARCTICA AS A CONTINENTAL NAME IN THE 1890S IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN USED BY SCOTTISH CARTOGRAPHER JOHN GEORGE BARTHOLOMEW. 
THE ANTARCTIC TREATY WAS SIGNED IN 1959 BY 12 COUNTRIES. MORE COUNTRIES HAVE SIGNED THE TREATY SINCE THEN. SO FAR 46 COUNTRIES HAVE SIGNED THE TREATY. THE TREATY DECLARES THAT MILITARY ACTIVITIES AND MINERAL MINING ARE AGAINST THE LAW. HOWEVER IT SUPPORTS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. IT ALSO HELPS THE CONTINENT S ECOZONE. MORE THAN 4 000 SCIENTISTS FROM DIFFERENT NATIONS AND DIFFERENT INTERESTS EXPERIMENT TOGETHER.
ANTARCTICA IS COVERED BY AN ICE SHEET ABOUT FOUR KILOMETRES THICK. UNDER THE ICE IT IS MOSTLY LAND ALTHOUGH THE ICE SHELVES ARE OVER THE OCEAN. THE TRANSANTARCTIC MOUNTAINS DIVIDE THE LAND BETWEEN EAST ANTARCTICA IN THE EASTERN HEMISPHERE AND WEST ANTARCTICA IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. 
ANTARCTICA HAS SOME IMPORTANT FEATURES HIDDEN BY THE ICE. ONE IS LAKE VOSTOK WHICH HAS BEEN COVERED BY ICE FOR AT LEAST 15 MILLION YEARS. THE LAKE IS 250 KM LONG AND 50 KM WIDE. ANOTHER IS THE HUGE GAMBURTSEV MOUNTAIN CHAIN WHICH ARE THE SIZE OF THE ALPS YET ENTIRELY BURIED UNDER THE ICE. THE GAMBURTSEV RANGE HAS A NEARBY MASSIVE RIFT VALLEY SIMILAR TO THE EAST AFRICAN GREAT RIFT VALLEY. IT IS CALLED THE LAMBERT SYSTEM. SCIENTISTS USED RADAR THAT CAN WORK UNDER ICE TO SURVEY THE WHOLE OF ANTARCTICA.
FEW LAND PLANTS GROW IN ANTARCTICA. THIS IS BECAUSE ANTARCTICA DOES NOT HAVE MUCH MOISTURE WATER SUNLIGHT GOOD SOIL OR A WARM TEMPERATURE. PLANTS USUALLY ONLY GROW FOR A FEW WEEKS IN THE SUMMER. HOWEVER MOSS LICHEN AND ALGAE DO GROW. THE MOST IMPORTANT ORGANISMS IN ANTARCTICA ARE THE PLANKTON WHICH GROW IN THE OCEAN.
ONE IMPORTANT SOURCE OF FOOD IN THE ANTARCTIC IS THE KRILL WHICH IS A GENERAL TERM FOR THE SMALL SHRIMP LIKE MARINE CRUSTACEANS. KRILL ARE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE FOOD CHAIN THEY FEED ON PHYTOPLANKTON AND TO A LESSER EXTENT ZOOPLANKTON. KRILL ARE A FOOD FORM SUITABLE FOR THE LARGER ANIMALS FOR WHOM KRILL MAKES UP THE LARGEST PART OF THEIR DIET. WHALES PENGUINS SEALS AND EVEN SOME OF THE BIRDS THAT LIVE IN ANTARCTICA ALL DEPEND ON KRILL.
WHALES ARE THE LARGEST ANIMALS IN THE OCEAN AND IN ANTARCTICA. THEY ARE MAMMALS NOT FISH. THAT MEANS THAT THEY BREATHE AIR AND DO NOT LAY EGGS. MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF WHALES LIVE IN THE OCEANS AROUND ANTARCTICA. 
WHALERS HAVE HUNTED WHALES FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS FOR MEAT AND BLUBBER. NOWADAYS MOST WHALING IS DONE IN THE ANTARCTIC AREA. 
PENGUINS ONLY LIVE SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR. SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS LIVE IN AND AROUND ANTARCTICA. THE BIGGEST ONES CAN STAND NEARLY 4 FEET 1.2M TALL AND CAN WEIGH ALMOST 100 POUNDS 40 KG. THE SMALLEST KINDS ARE ONLY ABOUT ONE FOOT 30 CM TALL. PENGUINS ARE LARGE BIRDS THAT SWIM VERY WELL BUT CANNOT FLY. THEY HAVE BLACK BACKS AND WINGS WITH WHITE FRONTS. THEIR FEATHERS ARE VERY TIGHTLY PACKED AND MAKE A THICK COVER. THEY ALSO HAVE A LAYER OF WOOLLY DOWN UNDER THE FEATHERS. THE FEATHERS THEMSELVES ARE COATED WITH A TYPE OF OIL THAT MAKES THEM WATERPROOF. A THICK LAYER OF BLUBBER ALSO KEEPS THEM WARM. PENGUINS EAT FISH AND ARE AT HOME IN THE OCEAN. THEY COME UP ON THE LAND OR ICE TO LAY THEIR EGGS AND RAISE THE CHICKS. THEY NEST TOGETHER IN A HUGE GROUP.
FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE HAD BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS A GREAT CONTINENT IN THE FAR SOUTH OF EARTH. THEY THOUGHT THIS TERRA AUSTRALIS WOULD BALANCE THE LANDS IN THE NORTH LIKE EUROPE ASIA AND NORTH AFRICA. PEOPLE HAVE BELIEVED THIS FROM THE TIMES OF PTOLEMY 1ST CENTURY AD. HE SUGGESTED THIS IDEA TO KEEP THE BALANCE OF ALL KNOWN LANDS IN THE WORLD. PICTURES OF A LARGE LAND IN THE SOUTH WERE COMMON IN MAPS. IN THE LATE 17TH CENTURY PEOPLE DISCOVERED THAT SOUTH AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA WERE NOT PART OF THE MYTHICAL ANTARCTICA. HOWEVER GEOGRAPHERS STILL BELIEVED THAT ANTARCTICA WAS MUCH BIGGER THAN IT REALLY WAS.
EUROPEAN MAPS CONTINUED TO SHOW THIS UNKNOWN LAND UNTIL CAPTAIN JAMES COOK S SHIPS HMS RESOLUTION AND ADVENTURE CROSSED THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE ON 17 JANUARY 1773 IN DECEMBER 1773. THEY CROSSED IT AGAIN IN JANUARY 1774. IN FACT COOK DID COME WITHIN ABOUT OF THE ANTARCTIC COAST. HOWEVER HE WAS FORCED TO GO BACK BECAUSE OF ICE IN JANUARY 1773. 
THE FIRST CONFIRMED SIGHTING OF ANTARCTICA WERE BY THREE DIFFERENT MEN. ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS SHIPS CAPTAINED BY THREE MEN SAW ANTARCTICA IN 1820. THE THREE MEN WERE FABIAN VON BELLINGSHAUSEN A CAPTAIN IN THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL NAVY EDWARD BRANSFIELD A CAPTAIN IN THE ROYAL NAVY AND NATHANIEL PALMER AN AMERICAN SEAL HUNTER OUT OF STONINGTON CONNECTICUT. THE FIRST RECORDED LANDING ON MAINLAND ANTARCTICA WAS BY THE AMERICAN SEALER JOHN DAVIS. HE LANDED ON WEST ANTARCTICA ON 7 FEBRUARY 1821. HOWEVER SOME HISTORIANS ARE NOT SURE ABOUT THIS CLAIM.
PEOPLE BEGAN DISCOVERING DIFFERENT PARTS OF ANTARCTICA AND MAPPING THEM. THIS WAS SLOW WORK BECAUSE THEY COULD ONLY WORK IN THE SUMMER. AT LAST A MAP WAS MADE AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT EXPLORING THE LAND NOT ONLY THE SEA. HOWEVER THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HARD WORK. THEY WOULD HAVE TO BREAK THROUGH THE ICE THAT WAS AROUND ANTARCTICA. THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO LAND ON IT AND BRING IN ENOUGH THINGS TO LIVE ON WHILE THEY EXPLORED THE LAND.
THE FIRST SERIOUS EXPLORATION OF THE ANTARCTIC LAND WAS THE NIMROD EXPEDITION LED BY ERNEST SHACKLETON IN 1907 09. THEY WERE THE FIRST TO CLIMB MOUNT EREBUS AND TO REACH THE SOUTH MAGNETIC POLE. SHACKLETON HIMSELF AND THREE OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS EXPEDITION MADE SEVERAL FIRSTS IN DECEMBER 1908 FEBRUARY 1909. THEY WERE THE FIRST HUMANS TO CROSS THE ROSS ICE SHELF AND THE TRANSANTARCTIC MOUNTAIN RANGE VIA THE BEARDMORE GLACIER. THEY WERE THE FIRST TO SET FOOT ON THE SOUTH POLAR PLATEAU. 
ROBERT FALCON SCOTT THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF ALL OF THE EXPLORERS WANTED TO BE THE FIRST MAN TO REACH THE SOUTH POLE. AT THE SAME TIME ANOTHER TEAM FROM NORWAY LEAD BY ROALD AMUNDSEN STARTED. THEY BOTH RACED EACH OTHER TO THE SOUTH POLE BUT IN THE END AMUNDSEN WON BECAUSE HE HAD MADE A GOOD USE OF HIS SLEIGH DOGS. SCOTT HAD USED PONIES AND MOTOR SLEDS BUT WHEN HE GOT TO THE SOUTH POLE HE FOUND A MESSAGE FROM AMUNDSEN SHOWING THAT HE HAD BEATEN SCOTT.
ON HIS WAY BACK SCOTT AND THREE COMPANIONS MET A BLIZZARD AND FROZE TO DEATH WHILE WAITING FOR IT TO FINISH. THE PEOPLE WHO FOUND HIM EIGHT MONTHS LATER ALSO FOUND HIS RECORDS AND DIARY WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN TO THE DAY HE DIED.
CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL WARMING ARE SHOWING EFFECTS IN ANTARCTICA PARTICULARLY THE ANTARCTIC PENINSULA.
PEOPLE OF THE ANTARCTIC LIVE IN THERE FOR A SHORT TIME TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ANTARCTICA SO MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE ARE SCIENTISTS. MOST ARE IN NATIONAL SCIENCE STATIONS ON THE COAST. SOME BASES ARE FAR FROM THE SEA FOR EXAMPLE AT THE SOUTH POLE. THEY STUDY THE WEATHER ANIMALS GLACIERS AND THE EARTH S ATMOSPHERE. SOME SCIENTISTS DRILL ICE CORES TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE WEATHER LONG AGO. PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE ANTARCTIC MUST BE CAREFUL BECAUSE A BLIZZARD CAN START ANY TIME AND ANY WHERE. WHEN THEY GO FAR AWAY FROM THEIR SHELTER THEY MUST ALWAYS TAKE LOTS OF FOOD JUST IN CASE.
TODAY PEOPLE EXPLORE ANTARCTICA USING SNOWMOBILES WHICH ARE FASTER THAN DOGS AND CAN PULL HEAVIER LOADS. MANY COME TO ANTARCTICA JUST FOR A SHORT VISIT AS A TRIP. THERE ARE COMPANIES IN SOUTH AMERICA THAT HAVE VACATIONS TO ANTARCTICA SO PEOPLE PAY TO GO THERE IN A SHIP. SOME PEOPLE MAY JUST TAKE THEIR OWN BOATS.
APPLE
THE APPLE TREE MALUS DOMESTICA IS A TREE THAT GROWS FRUIT SUCH AS APPLES IN THE ROSE FAMILY BEST KNOWN FOR ITS SWEET TASTY FRUIT. IT IS GROWN WORLDWIDE AS A FRUIT TREE. IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE A WORLDWIDE LOW COST FRUIT HARVEST ABLE ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
THE TREE ORIGINATED IN CENTRAL ASIA. APPLES HAVE BEEN GROWN FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN ASIA AND EUROPE. THEY WERE BROUGHT TO NORTH AMERICA BY EUROPEAN SETTLERS. APPLES HAVE RELIGIOUS AND MYTHOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN MANY CULTURES.
APPLES ARE GENERALLY PROPAGATED BY GRAFTING ALTHOUGH WILD APPLES GROW READILY FROM SEED. APPLE TREES ARE LARGE IF GROWN FROM SEED BUT SMALL IF GRAFTED ONTO ROOTS ROOTSTOCK. THERE ARE MORE THAN 7 500 KNOWN CULTIVARS OF APPLES WITH A RANGE OF DESIRED CHARACTERISTICS. DIFFERENT CULTIVARS ARE BRED FOR VARIOUS TASTES AND USES COOKING EATING RAW AND CIDER PRODUCTION ARE THE MOST COMMON USES. 
TREES AND FRUIT ARE ATTACKED BY FUNGI BACTERIA AND PESTS. IN 2010 THE FRUIT S GENOME WAS SEQUENCED AS PART OF RESEARCH ON DISEASE CONTROL AND SELECTIVE BREEDING IN APPLE PRODUCTION.
WORLDWIDE PRODUCTION OF APPLES IN 2013 WAS 90.8 MILLION TONNES. CHINA GREW 49 OF THE TOTAL.
THE APPLE HAS A SMALL LEAF SHEDDING TREE THAT GROWS UP TO TALL. THE APPLE TREE HAS A BROAD CROWN WITH THICK TWIGS.
THE LEAVES ARE ALTERNATELY ARRANGED SIMPLE OVALS. THEY ARE 5 TO 12 CENTIMETRES LONG AND 3 6CENTIMETRES 1.2 2.4IN WIDE. IT HAS A SHARP TOP WITH A SOFT UNDERSIDE. BLOSSOMS COME OUT IN SPRING AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE LEAVES BEGIN TO BUD. THE FLOWERS ARE WHITE. THEY ALSO HAVE A SLIGHTLY PINK COLOR. THEY ARE FIVE PETALED AND 2.5 TO 3.5 CENTIMETRES 0.98 TO 1.4 IN IN DIAMETER. THE FRUIT MATURES IN AUTUMN. IT IS USUALLY 5 TO 9 CENTIMETRES 2.0 TO 3.5 IN IN DIAMETER. THERE ARE FIVE CARPELS ARRANGED IN A STAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FRUIT. EVERY CARPEL HAS ONE TO THREE SEEDS.
THE WILD ANCESTOR OF APPLE TREES IS MALUS SIEVERSII. THEY GROW WILD IN THE MOUNTAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA IN THE NORTH OF KAZAKHSTAN KYRGYZSTAN TAJIKISTAN AND XINJIANG CHINA AND POSSIBLY ALSO MALUS SYLVESTRIS. UNLIKE DOMESTICATED APPLES THEIR LEAVES BECOME RED IN AUTUMN. THEY ARE BEING USED RECENTLY TO DEVELOP MALUS DOMESTICA TO GROW IN COLDER CLIMATES.
THE APPLE TREE WAS POSSIBLY THE EARLIEST TREE TO BE CULTIVATED. ITS FRUITS HAVE BECOME BETTER OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS. IT IS SAID THAT ALEXANDER THE GREAT DISCOVERED DWARF APPLES IN ASIA MINOR IN 300 BC. ASIA AND EUROPE HAVE USED WINTER APPLES AS AN IMPORTANT FOOD FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. FROM WHEN EUROPEANS ARRIVED ARGENTINA AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE USED APPLES AS FOOD AS WELL. APPLES WERE BROUGHT TO NORTH AMERICA IN THE 1600S. THE FIRST APPLE ORCHARD ON THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT WAS SAID TO BE NEAR BOSTON IN 1625. IN THE 1900S COSTLY FRUIT INDUSTRIES WHERE THE APPLE WAS A VERY IMPORTANT SPECIES BEGAN DEVELOPING.
IN NORSE MYTHOLOGY THE GODDESS I UNN GIVES APPLES TO THE GODS IN PROSE EDDA WRITTEN IN THE 13TH CENTURY BY SNORRI STURLUSON THAT MAKES THEM YOUNG FOREVER. ENGLISH SCHOLAR H. R. ELLIS DAVIDSON SUGGESTS THAT APPLES WERE RELATED TO RELIGIOUS PRACTICES IN GERMANIC PAGANISM. IT WAS FROM THERE SHE CLAIMS THAT NORSE PAGANISM DEVELOPED. SHE POINTS OUT THAT BUCKETS OF APPLES WERE DISCOVERED IN THE PLACE OF BURIAL FOR THE OSEBERG SHIP IN NORWAY. SHE ALSO REMARKS THAT FRUIT AND NUTS I UNN HAVING BEEN DESCRIBED AS CHANGING INTO A NUT IN SK LDSKAPARM L HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE EARLY GRAVES OF THE GERMANIC PEOPLES IN ENGLAND. THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN DISCOVERED SOMEWHERE ELSE ON THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE. SHE SUGGESTS THAT THIS MAY HAVE HAD A SYMBOLIC MEANING. NUTS ARE STILL A SYMBOL OF FERTILITY IN SOUTHWEST ENGLAND.
SOMETIMES APPLES ARE EATEN AFTER THEY ARE COOKED. OFTEN APPLES ARE EATEN UNCOOKED. APPLES CAN ALSO BE MADE INTO DRINKS. APPLE JUICE AND APPLE CIDER ARE APPLE DRINKS. 
THE FLESH OF THE FRUIT IS FIRM WITH A TASTE ANYWHERE FROM SOUR TO SWEET. APPLES USED FOR COOKING ARE SOUR AND NEED TO BE COOKED WITH SUGAR WHILE OTHER APPLES ARE SWEET AND DO NOT NEED COOKING. THERE ARE SOME SEEDS AT THE CORE THAT CAN BE REMOVED WITH A TOOL THAT REMOVES THE CORE OR BY CAREFULLY USING A KNIFE.
THE SCIENTIFIC NAME OF THE APPLE TREE GENUS IN THE LATIN LANGUAGE IS MALUS. MOST APPLES THAT PEOPLE GROW ARE OF THE MALUS DOMESTICA SPECIES.
MOST APPLES ARE GOOD TO EAT RAW NOT COOKED AND ARE ALSO USED IN MANY KINDS OF BAKED FOODS SUCH AS APPLE PIE. APPLES ARE COOKED UNTIL THEY ARE SOFT TO MAKE APPLE SAUCE.
APPLES ARE ALSO MADE INTO THE DRINKS APPLE JUICE AND CIDER. USUALLY CIDER CONTAINS A LITTLE ALCOHOL ABOUT AS MUCH AS BEER. THE REGIONS OF BRITTANY IN FRANCE AND CORNWALL IN ENGLAND ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR APPLE CIDERS.
IF ONE WANTS TO GROW A CERTAIN TYPE OF APPLE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DO THIS BY PLANTING A SEED FROM THE WANTED TYPE. THE SEED WILL HAVE DNA FROM THE APPLE THAT THE SEEDS CAME FROM BUT IT WILL ALSO HAVE DNA FROM THE APPLE FLOWER THAT POLLINATED THE SEEDS WHICH MAY WELL BE A DIFFERENT TYPE. THIS MEANS THAT THE TREE WHICH WOULD GROW FROM PLANTING WOULD BE A MIXTURE OF TWO. IN ORDER TO GROW A CERTAIN TYPE OF APPLE A SMALL TWIG OR SCION IS CUT FROM THE TREE THAT GROWS THE TYPE OF APPLE DESIRED AND THEN ADDED ON TO A SPECIALLY GROWN STUMP CALLED A ROOTSTOCK. THE TREE THAT GROWS WILL ONLY CREATE APPLES OF THE TYPE NEEDED.
THERE ARE MORE THAN 7 500 KNOWN CULTIVARS OF APPLES. DIFFERENT CULTIVARS ARE AVAILABLE FOR TEMPERATE AND SUBTROPICAL CLIMATES. ONE LARGE COLLECTION OF OVER 2 100 APPLE CULTIVARS IS AT THE NATIONAL FRUIT COLLECTION IN ENGLAND. MOST OF THESE CULTIVARS ARE GROWN FOR EATING FRESH DESSERT APPLES. HOWEVER SOME ARE GROWN SIMPLY FOR COOKING OR MAKING CIDER. CIDER APPLES ARE USUALLY TOO TART TO EAT IMMEDIATELY. HOWEVER THEY GIVE CIDER A RICH FLAVOR THAT DESSERT APPLES CANNOT.
MOST POPULAR APPLE CULTIVARS ARE SOFT BUT CRISP. COLORFUL SKIN EASY SHIPPING DISEASE RESISTANCE RED DELICIOUS APPLE SHAPE AND POPULAR FLAVOR ARE ALSO NEEDED. MODERN APPLES ARE USUALLY SWEETER THAN OLDER CULTIVARS. THIS IS BECAUSE POPULAR TASTES IN APPLES HAVE BECOME DIFFERENT. MOST NORTH AMERICANS AND EUROPEANS ENJOY SWEET APPLES. EXTREMELY SWEET APPLES WITH HARDLY ANY ACID TASTE ARE POPULAR IN ASIA AND INDIA.
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM THERE ARE ABOUT 3000 DIFFERENT TYPES OF APPLES. THE MOST COMMON APPLE TYPE GROWN IN ENGLAND IS THE BRAMLEY SEEDLING WHICH IS A POPULAR COOKING APPLE.
APPLE ORCHARDS ARE NOT AS COMMON AS THEY WERE IN THE EARLY 1900S WHEN APPLES WERE RARELY BROUGHT IN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS COMMON GROUND TEACH PEOPLE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF RARE AND LOCAL VARIETIES OF FRUIT. APPLE DAY IS CELEBRATED EACH OCTOBER 21 IN MANY COUNTRIES.
MANY APPLES ARE GROWN IN TEMPERATE PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. IN MANY AREAS WHERE APPLE GROWING IS IMPORTANT PEOPLE HAVE HUGE CELEBRATIONS 
THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF APPLES INCLUDING 
APPLES ARE IN THE GROUP MALOIDEAE. IT IS A SUBFAMILY OF THE FAMILY ROSACEAE. THEY ARE IN THE SAME SUBFAMILY AS PEARS. ITS FAMILY IS THE FAMILY OF ROSE LIKE PLANTS AND ROSES ARE IN THE FAMILY.
ARCTIC
THE ARCTIC IS THE AREA AROUND THE EARTH S NORTH POLE. THE ARCTIC INCLUDES PARTS OF RUSSIA ALASKA CANADA GREENLAND LAPLAND AND SVALBARD AS WELL AS THE ARCTIC OCEAN. IT IS AN OCEAN BUT IT IS ALWAYS COVERED WITH ICE. MOST SCIENTISTS CALL THE AREA NORTH OF THE TREELINE ARCTIC. TREES WILL NOT GROW WHEN THE TEMPERATURES GET TOO COLD. THE FORESTS OF THE CONTINENTS STOP WHEN THEY GET TOO FAR NORTH OR TOO HIGH UP A MOUNTAIN. HIGHER PLACES ARE COLDER TOO. THE PLACE WHERE IN THE TREES STOP IS CALLED THE TREE LINE.
THE AREA NORTH OF THE TREELINE IS NOT AN EMPTY ICE FIELD. IN FACT THE ONLY LARGE ICE COVERED LAND IS CENTRAL GREENLAND WHICH IS COVERED YEAR ROUND BY A CONTINENTAL GLACIER. THE LAND OF THE ARCTIC IS AROUND THE EDGES OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE AND IS USUALLY COVERED WITH TUNDRA. A TUNDRA IS A COLD ALMOST TREELESS PLAIN COVERED WITH MOSS AND GRASSLIKE PLANTS CALLED SEDGES.
TUNDRAS DO NOT GET VERY MUCH RAIN OR SNOW. HOWEVER THEY ARE VERY WET IN THE SUMMER TIME BECAUSE THREE FEET 1M OR SO BELOW THE SURFACE THE GROUND IS ALWAYS FROZEN. THIS PERMAFROST IS A LAYER OF ICE WITH THE HARDNESS OF STONE THAT KEEPS WATER FROM SOAKING INTO THE EARTH BENEATH IT. PERMAFROST CAN BE THOUSANDS OF FEET THICK. IN THE SUMMER THE GROUND ON TOP THAWS OUT WHEN THE SUN SHINES AND THE SNOW THAT DID FALL MELTS. BUT THE MELTED SNOW CANNOT DRAIN INTO THE GROUND IT JUST SOAKS THE TOPSOIL. THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THE WATER TO GO EXCEPT TO FORM LAKES AND PUDDLES ON TOP OF THE GROUND UNTIL IT FREEZES AGAIN OR DRIES UP.
IN THE ARCTIC DURING SUMMER THERE ARE NIGHTS WHEN THE SUN NEVER SETS. THIS IS BECAUSE DURING SUMMER THERE THE NORTH POLE POINTS TOWARD THE SUN. SO SOMETIMES PEOPLE CALL IT THE LAND OF THE MIDNIGHT SUN.
THE WORD COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD MEANING BEAR. THE NORTH POLE AIMS AT THE STARS CALLED THE GREAT BEAR AND THE LITTLE BEAR. THIS IS WHY IT IS CALLED THE ARCTIC.
IN SOME PARTS OF THE ARCTIC THE GROUND IS COVERED WITH BRIGHT COLORED FLOWERS DURING THE SHORT SUMMER. THESE LITTLE PLANTS HAVE VERY SHORT STEMS. THEY MUST STAY CLOSE TO THE GROUND BECAUSE THE EARTH IS WARMER THAN THE BITING WINDS THAT BLOW ABOVE IT. EVEN SOME ROCKS HAVE PLANTS GROWING ON THEM. THESE ROCK PLANTS ARE CALLED LICHENS. LICHENS WILL GROW ON THE BARE ROCKS. YELLOW REINDEER MOSS IS REALLY A LICHEN. IT GROWS SLOWLY BUT OFTEN GROWS OVER SIX INCHES 15 CM TALL. IT IS SPONGY AND FULL OF WATER. THIS PLANT IS THE SUMMER FOOD FOR REINDEER.
TREES ARE RARE ON THE TUNDRA. ONLY IN THE PROTECTED VALLEYS OR ALONG THE RIVERBANKS ARE SMALL TREES ABLE TO GROW. RIVERS COME INTO THE ARCTIC FROM THE WARMER SOUTH. THE PLACES ALONG THEIR BANKS ARE A LITTLE BIT WARMER THAN THE REST OF THE TUNDRA AND TREES CAN GROW THERE. OTHERWISE ONLY A FEW CLUSTERS OF BUSHES GROW SPARINGLY. BERRIES ARE THE ONLY FRUIT THAT GROWS IN THE ARCTIC.
EACH SUMMER THE ICE AND SNOW MELT ALLOWING THE ANIMALS TO FIND FOOD AND THE PLANTS TO FLOWER. THE MOISTURE FROM THE SNOW STAYS TOWARD THE TOP OF THE GROUND S SURFACE. PLANT ROOTS CAN USE IT FOR THEIR GROWTH. EVEN SO IN MANY PLACES THE SOIL IS TOO POOR FOR PLANT S GROWTH. LESS THAN HALF OF THE TUNDRA HAS PLANTS GROWING ON IT.
THE POLAR BEAR IS THE WORLD S LARGEST MEAT EATING LAND ANIMAL. POLAR BEARS ARE WELL ADAPTED TO HUNT SEALS OUT ON THE ICE. THEY ARE EXCELLENT SWIMMERS AND THE COLDEST WATER DOES NOT BOTHER THEM. THEY WAIT BY BREATHING HOLES IF THEY PICK UP THE SCENT OF A SEAL. THEY CAN ALSO BREAK THROUGH THE ICE AT THIN AREAS. SOMETIMES THEY CAN SNEAK UP ON A SLEEPING SEAL. THEY HAVE A VERY STRONG SENSE OF SMELL WHICH THEY USE TO FIND PREY OUT ON THE ICE. POLAR BEARS GET MOST OF THEIR FOOD WHEN THERE IS PACK ICE. THEY MUST EAT AND STORE FAT BEFORE THE ICE IS GONE THEY CANNOT CATCH SEALS IN OPEN WATER. AFTER MATING FEMALES DIG THEMSELVES INTO A DEN OF SNOW ON LAND FOR THE REST OF THE WINTER. THERE THEY HAVE THEIR CUBS USUALLY TWINS. BEARS USUALLY EAT FISH BIRDS EGGS SEAWEED AND DEAD WHALES BUT THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE A MEAL OF SEAL OR WALRUS.
THE ARCTIC FOX OFTEN TRAILS THE BEARS ONTO THE ICE TO EAT THEIR LEFTOVER FOOD. THE FOX ALSO EATS RABBITS LEMMINGS AND VOLES.
THE LEMMINGS AND VOLES ARE THE RATS AND MICE OF THE ARCTIC. THE LEMMINGS HAVE VERY SHORT TAILS. THEY LIVE UNDERGROUND IN SUMMER. BECAUSE THE TOP SOIL FREEZES IN THE WINTER THEY CANNOT BURROW UNDERGROUND THEN SO THEY LIVE UNDER THE SNOW DURING THE COLDER MONTHS. THEY EAT PLANTS AND ROOTS. IN A YEAR WITH PLENTY OF FOOD MILLIONS OF LEMMINGS WILL BE ROAMING THE TUNDRA. THE OWLS AND FOXES HAVE MORE FOOD THAN THEY CAN EAT. THEY WILL HAVE MORE YOUNG IN YEARS WHEN THERE ARE MANY LEMMINGS. HOWEVER THE TUNDRA DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOOD FOR MILLIONS OF LEMMINGS. THEY RUSH ACROSS THE TUNDRA LOOKING FOR FOOD AND ARE EATEN BY PREDATORS OR STARVE TO DEATH. SOME TRY TO SWIM ACROSS LAKES OR RIVERS AND DROWN. THE FEW THAT REMAIN CONTINUE TO HAVE FAMILIES.
CARIBOU AND THEIR RELATIVE THE REINDEER ALSO LIVE IN THE ARCTIC. THE CARIBOU ARE NOW FOUND MOSTLY IN NORTH AMERICA AND THEY ARE LARGER THAN THE REINDEER. LARGE HERDS FEED ON THE GRASS AND LICHENS. WHEN FALL COMES THEY MOVE SOUTH TO WINTER FEEDING GROUNDS. THEY DIG THROUGH THE SNOW WITH THEIR SHARP HOOFS FOR FOOD. THEIR HOLLOW FUR CREATES A CUSHION OF AIR AROUND THEM THAT HELPS THEM TO STAY WARM. IN THE SPRING THEY RETURN NORTH TO THE SUMMER PASTURES WHERE THEIR CALVES ARE BORN. AN HOUR OR SO AFTER BEING BORN THE CALVES ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE HERD TOWARD THE ARCTIC OCEAN. MOST OF THE WORLD S REINDEER LIVE IN EUROPE AND ASIA. SOME OF THESE REINDEER ARE NOT WILD. THEY HAVE BEEN TAMED BY HERDSMEN WHO PROTECT THEM FROM WOLVES AND LEAD THE MIGRATIONS EACH SPRING AND FALL. ALSO THE MUSK OX WHICH LOOKS LIKE A SHAGGY BUFFALO LIVES IN THE ARCTIC.
IN SUMMER MANY BIRDS VISIT THE ARCTIC AND MOST OF THEM ARE WATER BIRDS SUCH AS GEESE DUCKS SWANS LOONS AND ARCTIC TERNS. FLYING IN FOR THE SUMMER THEY RAISE THEIR YOUNG AND RETURN SOUTH FOR THE WINTER. THE SNOWY OWL AND THE PTARMIGAN STAY ALL YEAR. THE COLOR OF THE SNOWY OWL MATCHES THE SNOW. THE PTARMIGAN S SUMMER PLUMAGE CHANGES TO WHITE WHEN IT GETS COLDER.
THE SMALLEST ANIMALS OF THE ARCTIC ARE THE FLIES AND THE MOSQUITOES. THICK SWARMS BITE BOTH MEN AND ANIMALS IN THE SUMMER. THE REINDEER TRY TO ESCAPE THE MOSQUITOES BY RUNNING TO HIGHER PASTURES BUT THE ONLY REAL HELP COMES WITH THE SNOW AND COLD WHEN THE SWARMS DIE OFF FOR ANOTHER SEASON.
ONE OF THE SURPRISES OF THE ARCTIC IS THAT MANY PEOPLE LIVE THERE. SOME PEOPLE HAVE LIVED THERE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. ESKIMO AND LAPP PEOPLE LIVED IN THE ARCTIC LONG BEFORE ELECTRIC HEATERS SNOW MOBILES AND MODERN HOUSES.
IN AN EXTREMELY NORTHERN PART OF EUROPE THERE IS A PLACE CALLED LAPLAND. IT IS NOT A COUNTRY BUT PARTS OF FOUR COUNTRIES. THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE ARE CALLED LAPPS BY OUTSIDERS. THEY CALL THEMSELVES SAMI. THE LAPPS OF THESE FOUR COUNTRIES LIVED THERE LONG BEFORE THE COUNTRIES OF NORTHWAY SWEDEN FINLAND AND RUSSIA WERE CREATED. THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF LAPP PEOPLE. SOME LIVED BY THE OCEAN AND LIVED MOSTLY ON FISH. ANOTHER GROUP LIVED ALONG THE WARMER RIVERS. THESE PEOPLE DID A LITTLE FARMING HUNTING AND FISHING TO LIVE.
BUT THE BEST KNOWN OF THE LAPP PEOPLE WERE THE NOMADS WHO RAISED REINDEER. THE LAPPS SURVIVED IN THEIR HARSH HOMELAND BY DOMESTICATING THE REINDEER. THE LAPPS WERE ABLE TO GET EVERYTHING THEY NEEDED FROM THE DEER. THEY ATE MOSTLY MEAT MILK AND CHEESE. THEIR CLOTHES WERE MADE FROOM REINDEER SKINS AND WOOL. THEIR TENTS WERE ALSO MADE FROM DEER SKINS. THEY ARE KNOWN FOR THE BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED WOOLEN CLOTHING THEY MADE.
THE LAPPS PROTECTED THE HERDS MOVING WITH THEM AS THEY MIGRATED FROM SUMMER TO WINTER PASTURES. THEY USED TRAINED REINDEER TO PULL SLEDS CARRYING THEIR SUPPLIES. DURING THE WINTER THE HERDS MOVED SOUTH OF THE TREELINE. THE LAPPS WOULD LIVE NEARBY IN HOMES MADE OF LOGS OR SOD. THE LAPPS WERE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO WASTE ANYTHING THEY GOT FROM THE REINDEER. MILK WAS TAKEN FROM THE REINDEER TO DRINK OR MAKE CHEESE. MEAT WAS TAKEN FOR FOOD. THE BLOOD WAS FROZEN IN CHUNKS AND USED FOR SOUP AND PANCAKES. KNIVES AND BELT BUCKLES WERE CARVED FROM THE BONES AND ANTLERS. THE SINEWS WERE USED AS SEWING THREAD. CLEANED OUT STOMACHS WERE USED TO CARRY MILK OR CHEESE. EVERY PART OF A DEAD REINDEER WAS USED.
WINTER CLOTHING WAS MADE FROM LAYERS OF DEER SKIN. THE INSIDE LAYER WOULD BE WORN WITH THE FUR FACING IN TOWARD THE PERSON S SKIN. THE SECOND LAYER WAS WORN WITH THE FUR FACING OUT. BOOTS WERE ALSO MADE OF FUR LINED WITH GRASS THAT HAD BEEN GATHERED DURING THE SHORT SUMMER. EVERY EVENING THE GRASS WOULD BE TAKEN OUT AND DRIED BY THE FIRE SO IT WOULD BE READY TO USE AGAIN THE NEXT DAY. THUS A LAPP COULD BE WARM AND COMFORTABLE IN EVEN THE COLDEST WEATHER.
TODAY ONLY A FEW OF THE LAPP PEOPLE STILL FOLLOW THE HERDS. THOSE FEW USE MODERN TOOLS ON THEIR ANCIENT MIGRATION. THEY USE SNOWMOBILES TO HERD THE REINDEER AND RIFLES TO KILL THE WOLVES THAT CHASE THEM. EVEN HELICOPTERS AND RADIOS ARE USED TO LOCATE AND MOVE THE REINDEER. MOST OF THE LAPP PEOPLE NOW LIVE ON SMALL FARMS IN ONE OF THE FOUR NATIONS OF LAPLAND. THEY RAISE CROPS AND ANIMALS INCLUDING A FEW REINDEER TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. THE SALE OF REINDEER MEAT IS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INCOME FOR THE LAPP PEOPLE.
ESKIMOS ARE ARCTIC PEOPLE TOO. THEY SOMETIMES ATE RAW MEAT. ESKIMOS WERE ALSO NOMADS BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY ANIMALS EXCEPT FOR DOGS WHICH THEY USED FOR PULLING THEIR SLEDS AND HELPING THEM HUNT. THEY WERE HUNTERS AND GATHERERS AND THEY LIVED OFF ON WHATEVER THEY FOUND OR KILLED. LIKE THE LAPPS THOUGH THEY WERE VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE GOOD USE OF EVERY PART OF THE ANIMALS THEY KILLED. ESKIMOS LIVED IN TENTS DURING THE SUMMER AND SOD HOUSES OR IGLOOS IN THE WINTER. THE ESKIMOS MADE VERY CLEVER THINGS FROM THE BONES ANTLERS AND WOOD THEY HAD. THEY BUILT DIFFERENT KINDS OF BOATS.
ESKIMOS DID NOT HAVE A GOVERNMENT OR LAWS BECAUSE THEY LEARNED EARLY IN LIFE TO HELP EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. ALWAYS SHARING FOOD THEY USUALLY MOVED AROUND IN SMALL GROUPS LOOKING FOR FOOD. SOMETIMES THEY D GET TOGETHER IN A LARGE GROUP WHEN THEY HUNTED BIG ANIMALS SUCH AS WHALES. THE MEN DID THE HUNTING AND BUILDING THE HOMES AND THE WOMEN COOKED MADE THE CLOTHES AND TOOK CARE OF THE CHILDREN.
THE ARCTIC REGION HAS MANY MINERALS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE. IRON LEAD COAL COPPER GOLD AND TIN ARE ALL MINED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS COLD LAND. LARGE AMOUNTS OF PETROLEUM HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE ARCTIC IN RUSSIA ALASKA AND CANADA. PEOPLE LIVE AND WORK IN THE ARCTIC TO REMOVE THESE VALUABLE MINERALS AND SELL THEM.
THE OIL IN ALASKA FOR EXAMPLE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE UNITED STATES. THE MAIN SOURCE OF THE OIL IS NEAR PRUDHOE BAY ON ALASKA S NORTH COAST. IT WAS DISCOVERED IN 1968. PLANS WERE QUICKLY MADE TO BUILD A PIPELINE TO BRING THE OIL TO AN ICE FREE PORT SO IT COULD BE SHIPPED SOUTH. OIL COMPANIES SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BUILD THE TRANS ALASKA PIPELINE IN THE MID 1970S. IT HAD TO BE BUILT ABOVE THE GROUND IN THE NORTHERN SECTION BECAUSE OF THE PERMAFROST. THE WARM OIL IN THE PIPES COULD HAVE MELTED THE PERMAFROST AND CAUSED THE GROUND TO SINK. THAT WOULD HAVE BROKEN THE PIPES AND CAUSED AN OIL SPILL. THE PIPELINE WAS COMPLETED IN 1977. IT BRINGS OIL TO THE SEAPORT OF VALDEZ ON ALASKA S SOUTH COAST. FROM THERE THE OIL IS TAKEN BY HUGE TANKERS TO REFINERIES ALONG THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES. IF YOU LIVE IN WESTERN AMERICA YOUR FAMILY CAR MAY HAVE ALASKAN GASOLINE IN ITS TANK.
RUSSIA HAS MORE LAND IN THE ARCTIC THAN ANY OTHER NATION. THE RUSSIAN ARCTIC IN ASIA AND THE AREA JUST SOUTH OF IT ARE CALLED SIBERIA. IT IS SUCH AN EMPTY HARSH PLACE THAT IT HAS BEEN USED AS A PENAL COLONY FOR MANY YEARS. THE OLD RUSSIAN RULERS AND THE MODERN COMMUNIST SOVIETS WOULD SEND CRIMINALS AND PEOPLE WHO DISAGREED TO THE GOVERNMENT TO LIVE THERE. HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE WERE ALSO SENT THERE TO REMOVE MINERALS HARVEST TREES FROM FORESTS AND BUILD CITIES.
RUSSIA HAS A HUGE PORT CITY RIGHT IN LAPLAND WITHIN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. MURMANSK IS THE LARGEST CITY NORTH OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. THE PORT IS KEPT ICE FREE BY THE WARM WATERS OF THE GULF STREAM COMING UP AROUND NORWAY AND SWEDEN FROM THE SOUTH ATLANTIC. HUGE ICEBREAKERS WORK TO KEEP A PATH OPEN SO SHIPS CAN REACH THE PORT. THE PORT SHIPS OUT FISH MINERALS AND LUMBER TO RUSSIA AND THE REST OF THE WORLD.
THE ARCTIC IS ALSO THE SHORTEST WAY FOR AIRLINES TO FLY BETWEEN SOME CITIES ON DIFFERENT CONTINENTS. THE FLIGHT FROM LONDON TO TOKYO FOR EXAMPLE IS 1 400 MILES SHORTER IF FLOWN ACROSS THE TOP OF THE WORLD INSTEAD OF THE OLD ROUTE SOUTH ACROSS EUROPE AND ASIA. THE POLAR ROUTE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO NORWAY IS SEVERAL HOURS SHORTER THAN THE SAME FLIGHT GOING ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND THE PACIFIC OCEAN.
THUS MAN IS MAKING USE OF THE ARCTIC IN VARIOUS WAYS EVEN THOUGH IT IS A HARD PLACE TO LIVE.
ARMY
THE ARMY IS THE PART OF A COUNTRY S MILITARY THAT FIGHTS ON THE GROUND. PEOPLE IN THE ARMY ARE CALLED SOLDIERS. MANY MODERN ARMIES HAVE VEHICLES SUCH AS TANKS AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS TO HELP SOLDIERS FIGHT ON THE GROUND.
A SOLDIER MAY BE A VOLUNTEER SOMEONE WHO JOINS SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY WANT TO OR HE MAY BE FORCED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO JOIN THE ARMY. FORCING MEN TO JOIN THE ARMY IS CALLED CONSCRIPTION OR DRAFT. VOLUNTARY ARMIES TEND TO BE SMALL BY NUMBERS BUT HIGH IN CONFIDENCE AND QUALITY. DRAFTED ARMIES ARE LARGE BUT OFTEN LACKING IN CONFIDENCE AND IN QUALITY IT MAY BE VERY DIFFICULT TO FORCE SOMEONE TO RISK HIS LIFE AGAINST HIS WILL. SOMETIMES AN ARMY IS MADE UP FROM MERCENARIES WHO FIGHT JUST FOR PAY AND HAVE LITTLE LOYALTY TO THE COUNTRY WHICH THEY SERVE.
SOLDIERS DO MANY THINGS FROM SHOOTING ENEMIES TO DIGGING DEFENSIVE TRENCHES. THEY ARE USED TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY OR ATTACK ANOTHER COUNTRY S ARMY. IT IS DIFFICULT AND SOLDIERS MUST BE IN GOOD SHAPE BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY. THEY ALMOST ALWAYS MOVE TOGETHER AND THAT WAY THE TEAM CAN DO MORE THINGS IN A SAFER WAY. THEY MAY BE ASSIGNED TO CERTAIN PLACES TO GUARD OR THEY MAY BE TOLD TO SEARCH A PLACE OR EVEN ATTACK IT. THAT IS UP TO THEIR COMMANDER. EVERY SOLDIER ANSWERS TO SOMEONE ELSE SO THAT WAY EVERYTHING IS ORGANIZED.
SOMETIMES WHEN A COUNTRY S ARMY IS BUSY IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH SOLDIERS TO DO MORE A COUNTRY CAN HIRE CIVILIANS TO DO SOME OF THE ARMY S JOBS LIKE PROTECTING BUILDINGS AND IMPORTANT PEOPLE AND CONVOYS OF TRUCKS TRAVELING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER. USUALLY THEY HIRE VETERANS WHO WERE MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY BEFORE LEAVING AND WORKING ELSEWHERE.
WORKING IN THE ARMY AND WEARING THE UNIFORM IS CALLED SERVICE. A SOLDIER WILL NEVER SAY I WORK AS A SERGEANT IN THE SIGNAL CORPS BUT ALWAYS I SERVE AS A SERGEANT IN THE SIGNAL CORPS OR OTHER RANK SPECIALTY AND UNIT. ONLY CIVILIAN WORKERS WHO DO NOT WEAR UNIFORM SPEAK ABOUT WORKING IN THE ARMY.
THE FUNCTION OF THE ARMY IS BASED ON DISCIPLINE. THAT MEANS THAT EVERY SOLDIER WILL UNQUESTIONABLY CARRY OUT THE ORDERS WHICH HE OR SHE HAS RECEIVED AND WILL OBEY HIS OR HER SUPERIOR OFFICER OR NON COMMISSIONED OFFICER. THERE IS ONLY ONE EXCEPTION ORDERS WHICH VIOLATE THE HUMAN RIGHTS OR INTERNATIONAL LAW MUST NOT BE OBEYED AS IT IS CONSIDERED A WAR CRIME. THE CHAIN OF COMMAND IS EXPRESSED BY THE MILITARY RANK SYSTEM AND HIERARCHY.
A SOLDIER IS SUPPLIED WITH WEAPONS SUCH AS GUNS KNIVES AND OTHER SIMPLE GEAR FOR SURVIVING IN THE BATTLEFIELD SUCH AS FOOD WATER CLOTHES AND TENTS. THEY MUST KEEP GOOD CARE OF THE ITEMS. SOME SOLDIERS TRAIN TO BE A DOCTOR FOR THE ARMY OR OTHER CIVILIAN DUTIES.
BEFORE A SOLDIER JOINS THE ARMY HE MUST QUALIFY TO BE IN IT FIRST. THE PERSON IS PUT THROUGH TESTS SO THAT THE ARMY WILL KNOW IF THE RECRUIT CAN DO IT OR NOT. THIS IS SOMETIMES CALLED BOOT CAMP. HE MUST COMPLETE MENTAL TESTS AND PHYSICAL TESTS. IT DEPENDS ON WHERE HE IS TESTING THAT WILL TELL HIM HOW HARD IT WILL BE. HE WILL ALSO TAKE TESTS TO DETERMINE WHAT JOB HE WILL DO IN THE MILITARY. FOR INSTANCE HE MAY WORK WITH COMPUTERS AND BE A MEMBER OF THE SIGNAL CORPS OR BE A COOK FOR THE SOLDIERS HE MAY HAVE BEEN A CONSTRUCTION WORKER IN CIVILIAN LIFE AND BE A MILITARY ENGINEER HE MAY BECOME A TRUCK DRIVER AND SERVE IN LOGISTICS OR HE MAY BE VERY GOOD WITH A RIFLE AND BE A SNIPER IN THE INFANTRY. THERE ARE A LOT OF JOBS THAT A PERSON CAN CHOOSE TO DO IN THE ARMY.
THERE ARE TRADITIONALLY SIX BRANCHES OF SERVICE IN THE ARMY 
ART
ART IS A CREATIVE ACTIVITY THAT EXPRESSES IMAGINATIVE OR TECHNICAL SKILL. IT PRODUCES AN ARTIFACT ALSO CALLED A WORK OF ART FOR OTHERS TO EXPERIENCE. THOSE WHO DO THIS ARE CALLED ARTISTS. THEY HOPE TO AFFECT THE EMOTIONS OF PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE IT. SOME PEOPLE FIND ART RELAXING OR EXCITING OR INFORMATIVE. MANY PEOPLE DISAGREE ON HOW TO DEFINE ART. SOME SAY PEOPLE ARE DRIVEN TO MAKE ART DUE TO THEIR INNER CREATIVITY. 
ART INCLUDES DRAWING PAINTING SCULPTING PHOTOGRAPHY PERFORMANCE ART DANCE MUSIC POETRY PROSE AND THEATRE.
ART IS DIVIDED INTO THE PLASTIC ARTS WHERE SOMETHING IS MADE AND THE PERFORMING ARTS WHERE SOMETHING IS DONE BY HUMANS IN ACTION. THE OTHER DIVISION IS BETWEEN PURE ARTS DONE FOR THEMSELVES AND PRACTICAL ARTS DONE FOR A PRACTICAL PURPOSE BUT WITH ARTISTIC CONTENT.
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT ART IS A PRODUCT OR ITEM THAT IS MADE WITH THE INTENTION OF STIMULATING THE HUMAN SENSES AS WELL AS THE HUMAN MIND SPIRIT AND SOUL. AN ARTWORK IS NORMALLY JUDGED BY HOW MUCH IMPACT IT HAS ON PEOPLE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CAN RELATE TO IT AND HOW MUCH THEY APPRECIATE IT. SOME PEOPLE ALSO GET INSPIRED.
THE FIRST AND BROADEST SENSE OF ART MEANS ARRANGEMENT OR TO ARRANGE. IN THIS SENSE ART IS CREATED WHEN SOMEONE ARRANGES THINGS FOUND IN THE WORLD INTO A NEW OR DIFFERENT DESIGN OR FORM OR WHEN SOMEONE ARRANGES COLORS NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN A PAINTING TO MAKE AN IMAGE OR JUST TO MAKE A PRETTY OR INTERESTING DESIGN. 
ART MAY EXPRESS EMOTION. ARTISTS MAY FEEL A CERTAIN EMOTION AND WISH TO EXPRESS IT BY CREATING SOMETHING THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO THEM. MOST OF THE ART CREATED IN THIS CASE IS MADE FOR THE ARTIST RATHER THAN AN AUDIENCE. HOWEVER IF AN AUDIENCE IS ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THE EMOTION AS WELL THEN THE ART WORK MAY BECOME PUBLICLY SUCCESSFUL.
THERE ARE SCULPTURES CAVE PAINTING AND ROCK ART DATING FROM THE UPPER PALEOLITHIC ERA.
ALL OF THE GREAT ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS SUCH AS ANCIENT EGYPT INDIA CHINA GREECE ROME AND PERSIA HAD WORKS AND STYLES OF ART. IN THE MIDDLE AGES MOST OF THE ART IN EUROPE SHOWED PEOPLE FROM THE BIBLE IN PAINTINGS STAINED GLASS WINDOWS AND MOSAIC TILE FLOORS AND WALLS.
ISLAMIC ART INCLUDES GEOMETRIC PATTERNS ISLAMIC CALLIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE. IN INDIA AND TIBET PAINTED SCULPTURES DANCE AND RELIGIOUS PAINTING WERE DONE. IN CHINA ARTS INCLUDED JADE CARVING BRONZE POTTERY POETRY CALLIGRAPHY MUSIC PAINTING DRAMA AND FICTION. THERE ARE MANY CHINESE ARTISTIC STYLES WHICH ARE USUALLY NAMED AFTER THE RULING DYNASTY.
IN EUROPE AFTER THE MIDDLE AGES THERE WAS A RENAISSANCE WHICH MEANS REBIRTH. PEOPLE REDISCOVERED SCIENCE AND ARTISTS WERE ALLOWED TO PAINT SUBJECTS OTHER THAN RELIGIOUS SUBJECTS. PEOPLE LIKE MICHELANGELO AND LEONARDO DA VINCI STILL PAINTED RELIGIOUS PICTURES BUT THEY ALSO NOW COULD PAINT MYTHOLOGICAL PICTURES TOO. THESE ARTISTS ALSO INVENTED PERSPECTIVE WHERE THINGS IN THE DISTANCE LOOK SMALLER IN THE PICTURE. THIS WAS NEW BECAUSE IN THE MIDDLE AGES PEOPLE WOULD PAINT ALL THE FIGURES CLOSE UP AND JUST OVERLAPPING EACH OTHER.
IN THE LATE 1800S ARTISTS IN EUROPE RESPONDING TO MODERNITY CREATED MANY NEW PAINTING STYLES SUCH AS CLASSICISM ROMANTICISM REALISM AND IMPRESSIONISM. THE HISTORY OF TWENTIETH CENTURY ART INCLUDES EXPRESSIONISM FAUVISM CUBISM DADAISM SURREALISM AND MINIMALISM.
IN SOME SOCIETIES PEOPLE THINK THAT ART BELONGS TO THE PERSON WHO MADE IT. THEY THINK THAT THE ARTIST PUT HIS OR HER TALENT AND INDUSTRY INTO THE ART. IN THIS VIEW THE ART IS THE PROPERTY OF THE ARTIST PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT.
IN OTHER SOCIETIES PEOPLE THINK THAT ART BELONGS TO NO ONE. THEY THINK THAT SOCIETY HAS PUT ITS SOCIAL CAPITAL INTO THE ARTIST AND THE ARTIST S WORK. IN THIS VIEW SOCIETY IS A COLLECTIVE THAT HAS MADE THE ART THROUGH THE ARTIST.
THE FUNCTIONS OF ART INCLUDE 
1 COGNITIVE FUNCTION
2 AESTHETIC FUNCTION
3 PROGNOSTIC FUNCTION
4 RECREATION FUNCTION
5 VALUE FUNCTION
6 DIDACTIC FUNCTION
ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL
ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL IS A SPORT PLAYED BETWEEN TWO TEAMS. THERE WERE VARIOUS ATTEMPTS TO CODIFY THE RULES OF FOOTBALL IN ENGLAND IN THE MID 19TH CENTURY. THE PRESENT LAWS DATE BACK TO 1863 WHERE A RULESET WAS ADOPTED IN RUGBY WARWICKSHIRE BY THE NEWLY FORMED FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION. 
IN ITS COUNTRY OF ORIGIN UNITED KINGDOM IT IS CALLED FOOTBALL. IN OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA IT IS CALLED SOCCER. IN AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND IRELAND SOUTH AFRICA AND JAPAN BOTH WORDS ARE OFTEN USED. 
EACH TEAM HAS 11 PLAYERS ON THE FIELD. ONE OF THESE PLAYERS IS THE GOALKEEPER AND THE OTHER TEN ARE KNOWN AS OUTFIELD PLAYERS. THE GAME IS PLAYED BY KICKING A BALL INTO THE OPPONENT S GOAL. A MATCH HAS 90 MINUTES OF PLAY WITH A BREAK OF 15 MINUTES DURING THE MATCH. THE 90 MINUTES OF PLAY ALSO INCLUDES EXTRA TIME. THE BREAK IN THE MIDDLE IS CALLED HALF TIME.
THERE ARE MANY COMPETITIONS FOR FOOTBALL FOR BOTH FOOTBALL CLUBS AND COUNTRIES. FOOTBALL CLUBS USUALLY PLAY OTHER TEAMS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS. CARDIFF CITY F.C. AND SWANSEA CITY F.C FROM WALES FOR EXAMPLE PLAY IN THE ENGLISH LEAGUES AND IN THE ENGLISH FA CUP.
GROUPS SUCH AS UEFA AND FIFA ORGANISE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIONS BETWEEN CLUBS AND COUNTRIES. CLUBS PLAY IN COMPETITIONS SUCH AS UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE OR UEFA EUROPA LEAGUE AND COUNTRIES PLAY FOR THE WORLD CUP OR A CONTINENTAL TROPHY SUCH AS THE UEFA EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP.
THE FIFA WORLD CUP TAKES PLACE EVERY FOUR YEARS BETWEEN NATIONAL TEAMS AND IS THE WORLD S MOST POPULAR SPORTING EVENT EVEN MORE POPULAR THAN THE OLYMPIC GAMES. IN FOOTBALL THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES COMPETITIONS. IN A LEAGUE ALL OF THE TEAMS PLAY THE SAME NUMBER OF GAMES BUT IN A CUP TEAMS LEAVE THE COMPETITION WHEN THEY LOSE UNTIL THE LAST TWO TEAMS PLAY EACH OTHER TO DECIDE THE WINNER.
FOOTBALL IS THE WORLD S MOST POPULAR SPORT. IT IS PLAYED IN MORE COUNTRIES THAN ANY OTHER GAME. IN FACT FIFA THE FEDERATION INTERNATIONALE DE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION HAS MORE MEMBERS THAN THE UNITED NATIONS. IT IS PLAYED BY BOTH MALES AND FEMALES. 
IN EUROPE THE MAIN COMPETITIONS TO COMPETE TO BE THE BEST IN EUROPE ARE THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FOR THE TOP TEAMS FROM THE TOP LEAGUES IN EACH COUNTRY IN EUROPE. THEN THERE IS UEFA EUROPA LEAGUE WHICH IS FOR THE NEXT BEST TEAMS FROM EACH MEMBER OF THE UEFA.
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL CLUB IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF DOMESTIC LEAGUE RESULTS IS RANGERS F.C. FROM SCOTLAND WHO HAVE WON MORE DOMESTIC LEAGUE TITLES THAN ANY OTHER TEAM IN THE WORLD. THEY HAVE WON THE COUNTRY S LEAGUE 51 TIMES WHICH IS A WORLD RECORD. OTHER SUCCESSFUL CLUBS ARE FC BARCELONA AND REAL MADRID FROM SPAIN OR MANCHESTER UNITED FROM ENGLAND.
ASTRONOMY
ASTRONOMY IS A NATURAL SCIENCE. IT IS THE STUDY OF EVERYTHING OUTSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE OF EARTH.
IT STUDIES CELESTIAL OBJECTS SUCH AS STARS GALAXIES PLANETS MOONS ASTEROIDS COMETS AND NEBULAE AND PROCESSES SUCH AS SUPERNOVAE EXPLOSIONS GAMMA RAY BURSTS AND COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND RADIATION. THIS INCLUDES THE PHYSICS CHEMISTRY OF THOSE OBJECTS AND PROCESSES.
THE WORD ASTRONOMY COMES FROM THE GREEK WORDS ASTRON WHICH MEANS STAR AND NOMOS WHICH MEANS LAW. A PERSON WHO STUDIES ASTRONOMY IS CALLED AN ASTRONOMER.
ASTRONOMY IS ONE OF THE OLDEST SCIENCES. ANCIENT PEOPLE USED THE POSITIONS OF THE STARS TO NAVIGATE AND TO FIND WHEN WAS THE BEST TIME TO PLANT CROPS. ASTRONOMY IS VERY SIMILAR TO ASTROPHYSICS. A RELATED SUBJECT PHYSICAL COSMOLOGY IS CONCERNED WITH STUDYING THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE AND THE WAY THE UNIVERSE CHANGED OVER TIME. ASTRONOMY IS NOT THE SAME AS ASTROLOGY THE BELIEF THAT THE PATTERNS THE STARS AND THE PLANETS MAY AFFECT HUMAN LIVES.
SINCE THE 20TH CENTURY THERE HAVE BEEN TWO MAIN TYPES OF ASTRONOMY OBSERVATIONAL AND THEORETICAL ASTRONOMY. OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY USES TELESCOPES AND CAMERAS TO OBSERVE OR LOOK AT STARS GALAXIES AND OTHER ASTRONOMICAL OBJECTS. THEORETICAL ASTRONOMY USES MATHS AND COMPUTER MODELS TO PREDICT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN. THE TWO OFTEN WORK TOGETHER THE THEORETICAL PREDICTS WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN AND THE OBSERVATIONAL SHOWS WHETHER THE PREDICTION WORKS.
EARLY ASTRONOMERS USED ONLY THEIR EYES TO LOOK AT THE STARS. THEY USED MAPS OF THE CONSTELLATIONS AND STARS FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS AND ALSO TO WORK OUT THE TIME OF YEAR. EARLY CIVILISATIONS SUCH AS THE MAYA PEOPLE AND THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS BUILT SIMPLE OBSERVATORIES AND DREW MAPS OF THE STARS POSITIONS. THEY ALSO BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT THE PLACE OF EARTH IN THE UNIVERSE. FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE THOUGHT EARTH WAS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE AND THAT THE PLANETS THE STARS AND THE SUN WENT AROUND IT. THIS IS KNOWN AS GEOCENTRISM.
ANCIENT GREEKS TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE MOTIONS OF THE SUN AND STARS BY TAKING MEASUREMENTS. A MATHEMATICIAN NAMED ERATOSTHENES WAS THE FIRST WHO MEASURED THE SIZE OF THE EARTH AND PROVED THAT THE EARTH IS A SPHERE. A THEORY BY ANOTHER MATHEMATICIAN NAMED ARISTARCHUS WAS THAT THE SUN IS IN THE CENTER AND THE EARTH IS MOVING AROUND IT. THIS IS KNOWN AS HELIOCENTRISM. ONLY A FEW PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS RIGHT. THE REST CONTINUED TO BELIEVE IN THE GEOCENTRIC MODEL. MOST OF THE NAMES OF CONSTELLATIONS AND STARS COME FROM GREEKS OF THAT TIME. 
ARABIC ASTRONOMERS MADE MANY ADVANCEMENTS DURING THE MIDDLE AGES INCLUDING IMPROVED STAR MAPS AND WAYS TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF THE EARTH. THEY ALSO LEARNED FROM THE ANCIENTS BY TRANSLATING GREEK BOOKS INTO ARABIC.
DURING THE RENAISSANCE A PRIEST NAMED NICOLAUS COPERNICUS THOUGHT FROM LOOKING AT THE WAY THE PLANETS MOVED THAT THE EARTH WAS NOT THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING. BASED ON PREVIOUS WORKS HE SAID THAT THE EARTH WAS A PLANET AND ALL THE PLANETS MOVED AROUND THE SUN. THIS BROUGHT BACK THE OLD IDEA OF HELIOCENTRISM. A PHYSICIST CALLED GALILEO GALILEI BUILT HIS OWN TELESCOPES AND USED THEM TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT THE STARS AND PLANETS FOR THE FIRST TIME. HE AGREED WITH COPERNICUS. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH DECIDED THAT GALILEO WAS WRONG. HE HAD TO SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE UNDER HOUSE ARREST. HELIOCENTRIC IDEAS WERE SOON IMPROVED BY JOHANNES KEPLER AND ISAAC NEWTON WHO INVENTED THE THEORY OF GRAVITY. 
AFTER GALILEO PEOPLE MADE BETTER TELESCOPES AND USED THEM TO SEE FARTHER OBJECTS SUCH AS THE PLANETS URANUS AND NEPTUNE. THEY ALSO SAW HOW STARS WERE SIMILAR TO OUR SUN BUT IN A RANGE OF COLOURS AND SIZES. THEY ALSO SAW THOUSANDS OF OTHER FARAWAY OBJECTS SUCH AS GALAXIES AND NEBULAE.
THE 20TH CENTURY SAW IMPORTANT CHANGES IN ASTRONOMY.
IN 1931 KARL JANSKY DISCOVERED RADIO EMISSION FROM OUTSIDE THE EARTH WHEN TRYING TO ISOLATE A SOURCE OF NOISE IN RADIO COMMUNICATIONS MARKING THE BIRTH OF RADIO ASTRONOMY AND THE FIRST ATTEMPTS AT USING ANOTHER PART OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM TO OBSERVE THE SKY. THOSE PARTS OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM THAT THE ATMOSPHERE DID NOT BLOCK WERE NOW OPENED UP TO ASTRONOMY ALLOWING MORE DISCOVERIES TO BE MADE.
THE OPENING OF THIS NEW WINDOW ON THE UNIVERSE SAW THE DISCOVERY OF ENTIRELY NEW THINGS FOR EXAMPLE PULSARS WHICH SENT REGULAR PULSES OF RADIO WAVES OUT INTO SPACE. THE WAVES WERE FIRST THOUGHT TO BE ALIEN IN ORIGIN BECAUSE THE PULSES WERE SO REGULAR THAT IT IMPLIED AN ARTIFICIAL SOURCE.
THE PERIOD AFTER WORLD WAR 2 SAW MORE OBSERVATORIES WHERE LARGE AND ACCURATE TELESCOPES ARE BUILT AND OPERATED AT GOOD OBSERVING SITES NORMALLY BY GOVERNMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE BERNARD LOVELL BEGAN RADIO ASTRONOMY AT JODRELL BANK USING LEFTOVER MILITARY RADAR EQUIPMENT. BY 1957 THE SITE HAD THE LARGEST STEERABLE RADIO TELESCOPE IN THE WORLD. SIMILARLY THE END OF THE 1960S SAW THE START OF THE BUILDING OF DEDICATED OBSERVATORIES AT MAUNA KEA IN HAWAII A GOOD SITE FOR VISIBLE AND INFRA RED TELESCOPES THANKS TO ITS HIGH ALTITUDE AND CLEAR SKIES. 
THE NEXT GREAT REVOLUTION IN ASTRONOMY WAS THANKS TO THE BIRTH OF ROCKETRY. THIS ALLOWED TELESCOPES TO BE PLACED IN SPACE ON SATELLITES.
SPACE TELESCOPES GAVE ACCESS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY TO THE ENTIRE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM INCLUDING RAYS THAT HAD BEEN BLOCKED BY THE ATMOSPHERE. THE X RAYS GAMMA RAYS ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT AND PARTS OF THE INFRA RED SPECTRUM WERE ALL OPENED TO ASTRONOMY AS OBSERVING TELESCOPES WERE LAUNCHED. AS WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE SPECTRUM NEW DISCOVERIES WERE MADE.
FROM 1970S SATELLITES WERE LAUNCHED TO BE REPLACED WITH MORE ACCURATE AND BETTER SATELLITES CAUSING THE SKY TO BE MAPPED IN NEARLY ALL PARTS OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM.
DISCOVERIES BROADLY COME IN TWO TYPES BODIES AND PHENOMENA. BODIES ARE THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE WHETHER IT IS A PLANET LIKE OUR EARTH OR A GALAXY LIKE OUR MILKY WAY. PHENOMENA ARE EVENTS AND HAPPENINGS IN THE UNIVERSE. 
FOR CONVENIENCE THIS SECTION HAS BEEN DIVIDED BY WHERE THESE ASTRONOMICAL BODIES MAY BE FOUND THOSE FOUND AROUND STARS ARE SOLAR BODIES THOSE INSIDE GALAXIES ARE GALACTIC BODIES AND EVERYTHING ELSE LARGER ARE COSMIC BODIES.
DIFFUSE OBJECTS 
COMPACT STARS 
BURST EVENTS ARE THOSE WHERE THERE IS A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE HEAVENS THAT DISAPPEARS QUICKLY. THESE ARE CALLED BURSTS BECAUSE THEY ARE NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE EXPLOSIONS PRODUCING A BURST OF ENERGY. THEY INCLUDE 
PERIODIC EVENTS ARE THOSE THAT HAPPEN REGULARLY IN A REPETITIVE WAY. THE NAME PERIODIC COMES FROM PERIOD WHICH IS THE LENGTH OF TIME REQUIRED FOR A WAVE TO COMPLETE ONE CYCLE. PERIODIC PHENOMENA INCLUDE 
NOISE PHENOMENA TEND TO RELATE TO THINGS THAT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO. THE SIGNAL FROM THESE EVENTS BOUNCE AROUND THE UNIVERSE UNTIL IT SEEMS TO COME FROM EVERYWHERE AND VARIES LITTLE IN INTENSITY. IN THIS WAY IT RESEMBLES NOISE THE BACKGROUND SIGNAL THAT PERVADES EVERY INSTRUMENT USED FOR ASTRONOMY. THE MOST COMMON EXAMPLE OF NOISE IS STATIC SEEN ON ANALOGUE TELEVISIONS. THE PRINCIPAL ASTRONOMICAL EXAMPLE IS COSMIC BACKGROUND RADIATION.
THERE ARE WAY ASTRONOMERS CAN GET BETTER PICTURES OF THE HEAVENS. LIGHT FROM A DISTANT SOURCE REACHES A SENSOR AND GETS MEASURED NORMALLY BY A HUMAN EYE OR A CAMERA. FOR VERY DIM SOURCES THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH LIGHT PARTICLES COMING FROM THE SOURCE FOR IT TO BE SEEN. ONE TECHNIQUE THAT ASTRONOMERS HAVE FOR MAKING IT VISIBLE IS USING INTEGRATION WHICH IS LIKE LONGER EXPOSURES IN PHOTOGRAPHY.
ASTRONOMICAL SOURCES DO NOT MOVE MUCH ONLY THE ROTATION AND MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH CAUSES THEM TO MOVE ACROSS THE HEAVENS. AS LIGHT PARTICLES REACH THE CAMERA OVER TIME THEY HIT THE SAME PLACE MAKING IT BRIGHTER AND MORE VISIBLE THAN THE BACKGROUND UNTIL IT CAN BE SEEN. 
TELESCOPES AT MOST OBSERVATORIES AND SATELLITE INSTRUMENTS CAN NORMALLY TRACK A SOURCE AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE HEAVENS MAKING THE STAR APPEAR STILL TO THE TELESCOPE AND ALLOWING LONGER EXPOSURES. ALSO IMAGES CAN BE TAKEN ON DIFFERENT NIGHTS SO EXPOSURES SPAN HOURS DAYS OR EVEN MONTHS. IN THE DIGITAL ERA DIGITISED PICTURES OF THE SKY CAN BE ADDED TOGETHER BY COMPUTER WHICH OVERLAYS THE IMAGES AFTER CORRECTING FOR MOVEMENT.
WITH RADIO TELESCOPES SMALLER TELESCOPES CAN BE COMBINED TOGETHER TO CREATE A BIG ONE WHICH WORKS LIKE ONE AS BIG AS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO SMALLER TELESCOPES.
ADAPTIVE OPTICS MEANS CHANGING THE SHAPE OF THE MIRROR OR LENS WHILE LOOKING AT SOMETHING TO SEE IT BETTER.
DATA ANALYSIS IS THE PROCESS OF GETTING MORE INFORMATION OUT OF AN ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATION THAN BY SIMPLY LOOKING AT IT. THE OBSERVATION IS FIRST STORED AS DATA. THIS DATA WILL THEN HAVE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES USED TO ANALYSE IT.
FOURIER ANALYSIS IN MATHEMATICS CAN SHOW IF AN OBSERVATION OVER A LENGTH OF TIME IS CHANGING PERIODICALLY CHANGES LIKE A WAVE. IF SO IT CAN EXTRACT THE FREQUENCIES AND THE TYPE OF WAVE PATTERN AND FIND MANY THINGS INCLUDING NEW PLANETS.
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A FIELDS COMES FROM PULSARS WHICH PULSE REGULARLY IN RADIO WAVES. THESE TURNED OUT TO BE SIMILAR TO SOME BUT NOT ALL OF A TYPE OF BRIGHT SOURCE IN X RAYS CALLED A LOW MASS X RAY BINARY. IT TURNED OUT THAT ALL PULSARS AND SOME LMXBS ARE NEUTRON STARS AND THAT THE DIFFERENCES WERE DUE TO THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE NEUTRON STAR WAS FOUND. THOSE LMXBS THAT WERE NOT NEUTRON STARS TURNED OUT TO BE BLACK HOLES.
THIS SECTION ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE IMPORTANT FIELDS OF ASTRONOMY THEIR PERIOD OF IMPORTANCE AND THE TERMS USED TO DESCRIBE THEM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ASTRONOMY IN THE MODERN ERA HAS BEEN DIVIDED MAINLY BY ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THIS IS CHANGING.
SOLAR ASTRONOMY IS THE STUDY OF THE SUN. THE SUN IS THE CLOSEST STAR TO EARTH AT AROUND 92 MILLION 92 000 000 MILES AWAY. IT IS THE EASIEST TO OBSERVE IN DETAIL. OBSERVING THE SUN CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW OTHER STARS WORK AND ARE FORMED. CHANGES IN THE SUN CAN AFFECT THE WEATHER AND CLIMATE ON EARTH. A STREAM OF CHARGED PARTICLES CALLED THE SOLAR WIND IS CONSTANTLY SENT OFF FROM THE SUN. THE SOLAR WIND HITTING THE EARTH S MAGNETIC FIELD CAUSES THE NORTHERN LIGHTS. STUDYING THE SUN HELPED PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW NUCLEAR FUSION WORKS.
PLANETARY ASTRONOMY IS THE STUDY OF PLANETS MOONS DWARF PLANETS COMETS AND ASTEROIDS AS WELL AS OTHER SMALL OBJECTS THAT ORBIT STARS. THE PLANETS OF OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN DEPTH BY MANY VISITING SPACECRAFT SUCH AS CASSINI HUYGENS SATURN AND THE VOYAGER 1 AND 2.
GALACTIC ASTRONOMY IS THE STUDY OF DISTANT GALAXIES. STUDYING DISTANT GALAXIES IS THE BEST WAY OF LEARNING ABOUT OUR OWN GALAXY AS THE GASES AND STARS IN OUR OWN GALAXY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE. GALACTIC ASTRONOMERS ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE OF GALAXIES AND HOW THEY ARE FORMED THROUGH THE USE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TELESCOPES AND COMPUTER SIMULATIONS.
HYDRODYNAMICS IS USED IN ASTRONOMY FOR MATHEMATICALLY MODELLING HOW GASES BEHAVE. STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS FOUND AROUND MANY BODIES CAN DRASTICALLY CHANGE HOW THESE GASES BEHAVE AFFECTING THINGS FROM STAR FORMATION TO THE FLOWS OF GASES AROUND COMPACT STARS. THIS MAKES MHD AN IMPORTANT AND USEFUL TOOL IN ASTRONOMY.
GRAVITATIONAL WAVE ASTRONOMY IS THE STUDY OF THE UNIVERSE IN THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVE SPECTRUM. SO FAR ALL ASTRONOMY THAT HAS BEEN DONE HAS USED THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM. GRAVITATIONAL WAVES ARE RIPPLES IN SPACETIME EMITTED BY VERY DENSE OBJECTS CHANGING SHAPE WHICH INCLUDE WHITE DWARVES NEUTRON STARS AND BLACK HOLES. BECAUSE NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DETECT GRAVITATIONAL WAVES DIRECTLY THE IMPACT OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVE ASTRONOMY HAS BEEN VERY LIMITED.
WHICH IS LIKE LONGER EXPOSURES IN PHOTOGRAPHY.
ASTRONOMICAL SOURCES DO NOT MOVE MUCH ONLY THE ROTATION AND MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH CAUSES THEM TO MOVE ACROSS THE HEAVENS. AS LIGHT PARTICLES REACH THE CAMERA OVER TIME THEY HIT THE SAME PLACE MAKING IT BRIGHTER AND MORE VISIBLE THAN THE BACKGROUND UNTIL IT CAN BE SEEN. 
TELESCOPES AT MOST OBSERVATORIES AND SATELLITE INSTRUMENTS CAN NORMALLY TRACK A SOURCE AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE HEAVENS MAKING THE STAR APPEAR STILL TO THE TELESCOPE AND ALLOWING LONGER EXPOSURES. ALSO IMAGES CAN BE TAKEN ON DIFFERENT NIGHTS SO EXPOSURES SPAN HOURS DAYS OR EVEN MONTHS. IN THE DIGITAL ERA DIGITISED PICTURES OF THE SKY CAN BE ADDED TOGETHER BY COMPUTER WHICH OVERLAYS THE IMAGES AFTER CORRECTING FOR MOVEMENT.
WITH RADIO TELESCOPES SMALLER TELESCOPES CAN BE COMBINED TOGETHER TO CREATE A BIG ONE WHICH WORKS LIKE ONE AS BIG AS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO SMALLER TELESCOPES.
ADAPTIVE OPTICS MEANS CHANGING THE SHAPE OF THE MIRROR OR LENS WHILE LOOKING AT SOMETHING TO SEE IT BETTER.
DATA ANALYSIS IS THE PROCESS OF GETTING MORE INFORMATION OUT OF AN ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATION THAN BY SIMPLY LOOKING AT IT. THE OBSERVATION IS FIRST STORED AS DATA. THIS DATA WILL THEN HAVE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES USED TO ANALYSE IT.

IT TURNED OUT THAT ALL PULSARS AND SOME LMXBS ARE NEUTRON STARS AND THAT THE DIFFERENCES WERE DUE TO THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE NEUTRON STAR WAS FOUND. THOSE LMXBS THAT WERE NOT NEUTRON STARS TURNED OUT TO BE BLACK HOLES.
THIS SECTION ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE IMPORTANT FIELDS OF ASTRONOMY THEIR PERIOD OF IMPORTANCE AND THE TERMS USED TO DESCRIBE THEM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ASTRONOMY IN THE MODERN ERA HAS BEEN DIVIDED MAINLY BY ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THIS IS CHANGING.
ATHEISM
ATHEISM IS REJECTING THE BELIEF IN A GOD OR GODS.
IT IS THE OPPOSITE OF THEISM WHICH IS THE BELIEF THAT AT LEAST ONE GOD EXISTS. A PERSON WHO REJECTS BELIEF IN GODS IS CALLED AN ATHEIST.
ATHEISM IS NOT THE SAME AS AGNOSTICISM AGNOSTICS SAY THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO KNOW WHETHER GODS EXIST OR NOT. BEING AN AGNOSTIC DOES NOT HAVE TO MEAN A PERSON REJECTS OR BELIEVES IN GOD. SOME AGNOSTICS ARE THEISTS BELIEVING IN GOD. THE THEOLOGIAN KIERKEGAARD IS AN EXAMPLE. OTHER AGNOSTICS ARE ATHEISTS.
ATHEISTS OFTEN GIVE REASONS WHY THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IN A GOD OR GODS. THREE OF THE REASONS THAT THEY OFTEN GIVE ARE THE PROBLEM OF EVIL THE ARGUMENT FROM INCONSISTENT REVELATIONS AND THE ARGUMENT FROM NONBELIEF. NOT ALL ATHEISTS THINK THESE REASONS PROVIDE COMPLETE PROOF THAT GODS CANNOT EXIST BUT THESE ARE THE REASONS GIVEN TO SUPPORT REJECTING BELIEF THAT GODS EXIST.
SOME ATHEISTS DO NOT BELIEVE IN ANY GOD BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR ANY GOD NOR GODS AND GODDESSES SO BELIEVING ANY TYPE OF THEISM MEANS BELIEVING UNPROVED ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ATHEISTS THINK A SIMPLER EXPLANATION FOR EVERYTHING IS METHODOLOGICAL NATURALISM WHICH MEANS THAT ONLY NATURAL THINGS EXIST. OCCAM S RAZOR SHOWS SIMPLE EXPLANATIONS WITHOUT MANY UNPROVED GUESSES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE TRUE.
THE WORD ATHEISM COMES FROM THE GREEK LANGUAGE. IT CAN BE DIVIDED INTO A A GREEK PREFIX MEANING WITHOUT AND THEOS MEANING GOD AND RECOMBINED TO FORM WITHOUT GODS OR GODLESS. IN ANCIENT GREECE IT ALSO MEANT IMPIOUS.
STARTING IN ABOUT THE 5TH CENTURY BC THE WORD CAME TO DESCRIBE PEOPLE WHO WERE SEVERING RELATIONS WITH THE GODS OR DENYING THE GODS. BEFORE THEN THE MEANING HAD BEEN CLOSER TO IMPIOUS. THERE IS ALSO THE ABSTRACT NOUN ATHEISM.
CICERO TRANSLITERATED THE GREEK WORD INTO THE LATIN ATHEOS. THIS WORD WAS OFTEN USED IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN EARLY CHRISTIANS AND HELLENISTS. EACH SIDE USED IT TO LABEL THE OTHER IN A BAD WAY.
KAREN ARMSTRONG WRITES THAT DURING THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES THE WORD ATHEIST WAS STILL RESERVED EXCLUSIVELY FOR POLEMIC... THE TERM ATHEIST WAS AN INSULT. NOBODY WOULD HAVE DREAMED OF CALLING HIMSELF AN ATHEIST. 
ATHEISM WAS FIRST USED TO DESCRIBE AN OPENLY POSITIVE BELIEF IN LATE 18TH CENTURY EUROPE MEANING DISBELIEF IN THE MONOTHEISTIC ABRAHAMIC GOD.
THE 20TH CENTURY SAW THE TERM EXPAND TO REFER TO DISBELIEF IN ALL DEITIES. HOWEVER IT IS STILL COMMON IN WESTERN SOCIETY TO DESCRIBE ATHEISM AS SIMPLY DISBELIEF IN GOD.
IN MANY PLACES IT IS OR WAS A CRIME TO MAKE PUBLIC THE IDEA OF ATHEISM. EXAMPLES WOULD BE TO CLAIM THE BIBLE OR QUR AN COULD NOT BE TRUE OR TO SPEAK OR WRITE THAT THERE IS NO GOD.
MUSLIM APOSTASY THAT IS BECOMING AN ATHEIST OR BELIEVING IN A GOD OTHER THAN ALLAH MAY BE A DANGEROUS ACT IN PLACES WITH MANY CONSERVATIVE MUSLIM PEOPLE. MANY RELIGIOUS COURTS HAVE PUNISHED AND SOME STILL PUNISH THIS ACT WITH THE DEATH PENALTY. MANY COUNTRIES STILL HAVE LAWS AGAINST ATHEISM.
ATHEISM IS BECOMING MORE COMMON MAINLY IN SOUTH AMERICA NORTH AMERICA OCEANIA AND EUROPE BY PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT HAD A RELIGION BEFORE AND STARTED TO BE ATHEIST.
IN MANY COUNTRIES MAINLY IN THE WESTERN WORLD THERE ARE LAWS THAT PROTECT ATHEISTS RIGHT TO EXPRESS THEIR ATHEISTIC BELIEF FREEDOM OF SPEECH. THIS MEANS THAT ATHEISTS HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW AS EVERYONE ELSE. FREEDOM OF RELIGION IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND TREATIES INCLUDES THE FREEDOM TO NOT HAVE A RELIGION.
TODAY ABOUT 2.3 OF THE WORLD S POPULATION DESCRIBES ITSELF AS ATHEIST. ABOUT 11.9 IS DESCRIBED AS NONTHEIST.
BETWEEN 64 AND 65 OF JAPANESE DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS ATHEISTS AGNOSTICS OR NON BELIEVERS 
AND UP TO 48 IN RUSSIA. THE PERCENTAGE OF SUCH PEOPLE IN EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES RANGES BETWEEN 6 ITALY AND 85 SWEDEN.
PEOPLE DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT ATHEISM MEANS. THEY DISAGREE ON WHEN TO CALL CERTAIN PEOPLE ATHEISTS OR NOT.
ATHEISM IS GENERALLY DESCRIBED AS NOT BELIEVING IN GOD. 
GEORGE H. SMITH CREATED THE EXPRESSIONS IMPLICIT ATHEISM AND EXPLICIT ATHEISM TO DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF ATHEISM. IMPLICIT ATHEISM IS WHEN YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN GOD BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF GOD. EXPLICIT ATHEISM IS WHEN YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN GOD AFTER LEARNING ABOUT THE IDEA.
IN 1772 BARON D HOLBACH SAID THAT ALL CHILDREN ARE BORN ATHEISTS THEY HAVE NO IDEA OF GOD.
IN 1979 GEORGE H. SMITH SAID THAT THE MAN WHO IS UNACQUAINTED WITH THEISM IS AN ATHEIST BECAUSE HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN A GOD. THIS CATEGORY WOULD ALSO INCLUDE THE CHILD WHO IS ABLE TO GRASP THE ISSUES INVOLVED BUT WHO IS STILL UNAWARE OF THOSE ISSUES. THE FACT THAT THIS CHILD DOES NOT BELIEVE IN GOD QUALIFIES HIM AS AN ATHEIST.
THOSE TWO QUOTES DESCRIBE IMPLICIT ATHEISM.
ERNEST NAGEL DISAGREES WITH SMITH S DEFINITION OF ATHEISM AS AN ABSENCE OF THEISM SAYING ONLY EXPLICIT ATHEISM IS TRUE ATHEISM. THIS MEANS THAT NAGEL BELIEVES THAT TO BE AN ATHEIST A PERSON NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT GOD AND THEN REJECT THE IDEA OF GOD.
PHILOSOPHERS LIKE ANTONY FLEW 
HAVE LOOKED AT STRONG SOMETIMES CALLED POSITIVE ATHEISM AGAINST WEAK SOMETIMES CALLED NEGATIVE ATHEISM. ACCORDING TO THIS IDEA ANYONE WHO DOES NOT BELIEVE IN A GOD OR GODS IS EITHER A WEAK OR A STRONG ATHEIST.
STRONG ATHEISM IS THE CERTAIN BELIEF THAT NO GOD EXISTS. AN OLDER WAY OF SAYING STRONG ATHEISM IS TO SAY POSITIVE ATHEISM. WEAK ATHEISM IS ALL OTHER FORMS OF NOT BELIEVING IN A GOD OR GODS. AN OLDER WAY OF SAYING WEAK ATHEISM IS TO SAY NEGATIVE ATHEISM THESE TERMS HAVE BEEN USED MORE IN PHILOSOPHICAL WRITING AND IN CATHOLIC BELIEFS.
SINCE AT LEAST 1813.
UNDER THIS DEFINITION OF ATHEISM MOST AGNOSTICS ARE WEAK ATHEISTS.
MICHAEL MARTIN SAYS THAT AGNOSTICISM INCLUDES WEAK ATHEISM. SOME AGNOSTICS INCLUDING ANTHONY KENNY DISAGREE. THEY THINK BEING AN AGNOSTIC IS DIFFERENT FROM BEING AN ATHEIST. THEY THINK ATHEISM IS NO DIFFERENT FROM BELIEVING IN A GOD BECAUSE BOTH REQUIRE BELIEF. THIS OVERLOOKS THE REALITY THAT AGNOSTICS ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN BELIEF OR CLAIM TO KNOWLEDGE 
AGNOSTICS SAY THAT IT CANNOT BE KNOWN IF A GOD OR GODS EXIST. IN THEIR VIEW STRONG ATHEISM REQUIRES A LEAP OF FAITH.
ATHEISTS USUALLY RESPOND BY SAYING THAT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN IDEA ABOUT RELIGION WITH NO PROOF AND AN IDEA ABOUT OTHER THINGS
THE LACK OF PROOF THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE IS NO GOD BUT IT ALSO DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE IS A GOD.
SCOTTISH PHILOSOPHER J.J.C. SMART SAYS THAT SOMETIMES A PERSON WHO IS REALLY AN ATHEIST MAY DESCRIBE HERSELF EVEN PASSIONATELY AS AN AGNOSTIC BECAUSE OF UNREASONABLE GENERALISED PHILOSOPHICAL SKEPTICISM WHICH WOULD PRECLUDE US FROM SAYING THAT WE KNOW ANYTHING WHATEVER EXCEPT PERHAPS THE TRUTHS OF MATHEMATICS AND FORMAL LOGIC.
SO SOME POPULAR ATHEIST AUTHORS SUCH AS RICHARD DAWKINS LIKE TO SHOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIST AGNOSTIC AND ATHEIST POSITIONS BY THE PROBABILITY ASSIGNED TO THE STATEMENT GOD EXISTS.
IN EVERYDAY LIFE MANY PEOPLE DEFINE NATURAL PHENOMENA WITHOUT THE NEED OF A GOD OR GODS. THEY DO NOT DENY THE EXISTENCE OF ONE OR MORE GODS THEY SIMPLY SAY THAT THIS EXISTENCE IS NOT NECESSARY. GODS DO NOT PROVIDE A PURPOSE TO LIFE NOR INFLUENCE IT ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW.
MANY SCIENTISTS PRACTICE WHAT THEY CALL METHODOLOGICAL NATURALISM. THEY SILENTLY ADOPT PHILOSOPHICAL NATURALISM AND USE THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. THEIR BELIEF IN A GOD DOES NOT AFFECT THEIR RESULTS.
PRACTICAL ATHEISM CAN TAKE DIFFERENT FORMS 
THEORETIC ATHEISM TRIES TO FIND ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND TO DISPROVE THE ARGUMENTS OF THEISM SUCH AS THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN OR PASCAL S WAGER. THESE THEORETICAL REASONS HAVE MANY FORMS MOST OF THEM ARE ONTOLOGICAL OR EPISTEMOLOGICAL. SOME RELY ON PSYCHOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY.
ACCORDING TO IMMANUEL KANT THERE CAN BE NO PROOF OF A SUPREME BEING THAT IS MADE USING REASON. IN HIS WORK CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON HE TRIES TO SHOW THAT ALL ATTEMPTS OF EITHER PROVING THE EXISTENCE OF GOD OR DISPROVING IT END IN LOGICAL CONTRADICTIONS. KANT SAYS THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE ANY HIGHER BEINGS. THIS MAKES HIM AN AGNOSTIC.
LUDWIG FEUERBACH PUBLISHED THE ESSENCE OF CHRISTIANITY IN 1841. IN HIS WORK HE POSTULATES THE FOLLOWING 
THE FOLLOWING PHRASES SUM UP FEUERBACH S WRITING 
ATMOSPHERE OF EARTH
EARTH S ATMOSPHERE IS THE LAYER OF GASES AROUND THE EARTH. THE ATMOSPHERE IS HELD IN PLACE BY EARTH S GRAVITY. IT IS MADE UP MAINLY OF NITROGEN 78.1. IT ALSO HAS PLENTIFUL OXYGEN 20.9 AND SMALL AMOUNTS OF ARGON 0.9 CARBON DIOXIDE 0.035 WATER VAPOR AND OTHER GASES. THE ATMOSPHERE PROTECTS LIFE ON EARTH BY ABSORBING TAKING ULTRAVIOLET RAYS FROM THE SUN. IT MAKES OUR DAYS COOLER AND OUR NIGHTS WARMER.
SOLID PARTICULATES INCLUDING ASH DUST VOLCANIC ASH ETC. ARE SMALL PARTS OF ATMOSPHERE. THEY ARE IMPORTANT IN MAKING CLOUDS AND FOG.
THE ATMOSPHERE DOES NOT END AT A SPECIFIC PLACE. THE HIGHER ABOVE THE EARTH SOMETHING IS THE THINNER THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND IT IS. THERE IS NO CLEAR BORDER BETWEEN THE ATMOSPHERE AND OUTER SPACE. 75 OF THE ATMOSPHERE IS WITHIN OF THE EARTH S SURFACE.
ORIGINALLY THE EARTH S ATMOSPHERE HAD ALMOST NO FREE OXYGEN. IT GRADUALLY CHANGED TO WHAT IT IS TODAY OVER A VERY LONG TIME SEE GREAT OXYGENATION EVENT. THE PROCESS BEGAN WITH CYANOBACTERIA. THEY WERE THE FIRST ORGANISMS TO MAKE FREE OXYGEN BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS. MOST ORGANISMS TODAY NEED OXYGEN FOR THEIR RESPIRATION ONLY A FEW ANAEROBIC ORGANISMS CAN GROW WITHOUT OXYGEN. 
SOME PARTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE ARE HOT OR COLD DEPENDING ON HEIGHT. IF SOMETHING CLIMBED STRAIGHT UP IT WOULD GET COLDER BUT THEN IT WOULD GET HOTTER AS THE OBJECT CLIMBED HIGHER. THESE CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE ARE DIVIDED INTO LAYERS. THESE ARE LIKE LAYERS OF AN ONION. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LAYERS IS THE WAY THE TEMPERATURE CHANGES.
THESE ARE THE LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE STARTING FROM THE GROUND 
WHERE ONE LAYER CHANGES TO THE NEXT HAVE BEEN NAMED PAUSES. SO THE TROPOPAUSE IS WHERE THE TROPOSPHERE ENDS HIGH. THE STRATOPAUSE IS AT THE END OF THE STRATOSPHERE. THE MESOPAUSE IS AT THE END OF THE MESOSPHERE. 
THESE ARE CALLED BOUNDARIES.
THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AT THE SURFACE OF EARTH IS.
THE ATMOSPHERE HAS PRESSURE. THIS IS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH AIR IS A GAS IT HAS WEIGHT. THE AVERAGE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AT SEA LEVEL IS ABOUT.
THE DENSITY OF AIR AT SEA LEVEL IS ABOUT 1.2 KILOGRAMS PER CUBIC METER. THIS DENSITY BECOMES LESS AT HIGHER ALTITUDES AT THE SAME RATE THAT PRESSURE BECOMES LESS. THE TOTAL MASS OF THE ATMOSPHERE IS ABOUT 5.1 10 KG WHICH IS ONLY A VERY SMALL PART OF THE EARTH S TOTAL MASS.
ATOM
AN ATOM IS THE BASIC UNIT THAT MAKES UP ALL MATTER. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF ATOMS EACH WITH ITS OWN NAME MASS AND SIZE. THESE DIFFERENT ATOMS ARE CALLED CHEMICAL ELEMENTS. THE CHEMICAL ELEMENTS ARE ORGANIZED ON THE PERIODIC TABLE. EXAMPLES OF ELEMENTS ARE HYDROGEN AND GOLD. 
ATOMS ARE VERY SMALL BUT THE EXACT SIZE CHANGES DEPENDING ON THE ELEMENT. ATOMS RANGE FROM 0.1 TO 0.5 NANOMETERS IN WIDTH. ONE NANOMETER IS ABOUT 100 000 TIMES SMALLER THAN THE WIDTH OF A HUMAN HAIR. THIS MAKES ATOMS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE WITHOUT SPECIAL TOOLS. EQUATIONS MUST BE USED TO SEE THE WAY THEY WORK AND HOW THEY INTERACT WITH OTHER ATOMS.
ATOMS JOIN TOGETHER TO MAKE MOLECULES FOR EXAMPLE TWO HYDROGEN ATOMS AND ONE OXYGEN ATOM COMBINE TO MAKE A WATER MOLECULE. WHEN ATOMS JOIN TOGETHER IT IS CALLED A CHEMICAL REACTION.
EVERY ATOM IS MADE UP OF THREE KINDS OF SMALLER PARTICLES CALLED PROTONS WHICH ARE POSITIVELY CHARGED NEUTRONS WHICH HAVE NO CHARGE AND ELECTRONS WHICH ARE NEGATIVELY CHARGED. THE PROTONS AND NEUTRONS ARE HEAVIER AND STAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATOM. THEY ARE CALLED THE NUCLEUS. THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY A CLOUD OF ELECTRONS WHICH ARE VERY LIGHT IN WEIGHT AND ARE ATTRACTED TO THE POSITIVE CHARGE OF THE NUCLEUS. THIS ATTRACTION IS CALLED ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE.
THE NUMBER OF PROTONS NEUTRONS AND ELECTRONS AN ATOM HAS TELLS US WHAT ELEMENT IT IS. HYDROGEN FOR EXAMPLE HAS ONE PROTON NO NEUTRONS AND ONE ELECTRON THE ELEMENT SULFUR HAS 16 PROTONS 16 NEUTRONS AND 16 ELECTRONS. THE NUMBER OF PROTONS IS THE ATOMIC NUMBER. THE NUMBER OF PROTONS AND NEUTRONS TOGETHER IS THE ATOMIC WEIGHT.
ATOMS MOVE FASTER WHEN THEY ARE IN GAS FORM BECAUSE THEY ARE FREE TO MOVE THAN THEY DO IN LIQUID FORM AND SOLID MATTER. IN SOLID MATERIALS THE ATOMS ARE TIGHTLY PACKED NEXT TO EACH OTHER SO THEY VIBRATE BUT ARE NOT ABLE TO MOVE THERE IS NO ROOM AS ATOMS IN LIQUIDS DO.
THE WORD ATOM COMES FROM THE GREEK ATOMOS INDIVISIBLE FROM NOT AND A CUT. THE FIRST HISTORICAL MENTION OF THE WORD ATOM CAME FROM WORKS BY THE GREEK PHILOSOPHER DEMOCRITUS AROUND 400 BC. ATOMIC THEORY STAYED AS A MOSTLY PHILOSOPHICAL SUBJECT WITH NOT MUCH ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION OR STUDY UNTIL THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMISTRY IN THE 1650S.
IN 1777 FRENCH CHEMIST ANTOINE LAVOISIER DEFINED THE TERM ELEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME. HE SAID THAT AN ELEMENT WAS ANY BASIC SUBSTANCE THAT COULD NOT BE BROKEN DOWN INTO OTHER SUBSTANCES BY THE METHODS OF CHEMISTRY. ANY SUBSTANCE THAT COULD BE BROKEN DOWN WAS A COMPOUND.
IN 1803 ENGLISH PHILOSOPHER JOHN DALTON SUGGESTED THAT ELEMENTS WERE TINY SOLID BALLS MADE OF ATOMS. DALTON BELIEVED THAT ALL ATOMS OF THE SAME ELEMENT HAVE THE SAME MASS. HE SAID THAT COMPOUNDS ARE FORMED WHEN ATOMS OF MORE THAN ONE ELEMENT COMBINE. ACCORDING TO DALTON IN A CERTAIN COMPOUND THE ATOMS OF THE COMPOUND S ELEMENTS ALWAYS COMBINE THE SAME WAY.
IN 1827 BRITISH SCIENTIST ROBERT BROWN LOOKED AT POLLEN GRAINS IN WATER UNDER HIS MICROSCOPE. THE POLLEN GRAINS APPEARED TO BE JIGGLING. BROWN USED DALTON S ATOMIC THEORY TO DESCRIBE PATTERNS IN THE WAY THEY MOVED. THIS WAS CALLED BROWNIAN MOTION. IN 1905 ALBERT EINSTEIN USED MATHEMATICS TO PROVE THAT THE SEEMINGLY RANDOM MOVEMENTS WERE CAUSED BY THE REACTIONS OF ATOMS AND BY DOING THIS HE CONCLUSIVELY PROVED THE EXISTENCE OF THE ATOM.
IN 1869 SCIENTIST DMITRI MENDELEEV PUBLISHED THE FIRST VERSION OF THE PERIODIC TABLE. THE PERIODIC TABLE GROUPS ELEMENTS BY THEIR ATOMIC NUMBER HOW MANY PROTONS THEY HAVE. THIS IS USUALLY THE SAME AS THE NUMBER OF ELECTRONS. 
ELEMENTS IN THE SAME COLUMN OR PERIOD USUALLY HAVE SIMILAR PROPERTIES. FOR EXAMPLE HELIUM NEON ARGON KRYPTON AND XENON ARE ALL IN THE SAME COLUMN AND HAVE VERY SIMILAR PROPERTIES. ALL THESE ELEMENTS ARE GASES THAT HAVE NO COLOUR AND NO SMELL. ALSO THEY ARE UNABLE TO COMBINE WITH OTHER ATOMS TO FORM COMPOUNDS. TOGETHER THEY ARE KNOWN AS THE NOBLE GASES.
THE PHYSICIST J.J. THOMSON WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO DISCOVER ELECTRONS. THIS HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS WORKING WITH CATHODE RAYS IN 1897. HE REALIZED THEY HAD A NEGATIVE CHARGE UNLIKE PROTONS POSITIVE AND NEUTRONS NO CHARGE. THOMSON CREATED THE PLUM PUDDING MODEL WHICH STATED THAT AN ATOM WAS LIKE PLUM PUDDING THE DRIED FRUIT ELECTRONS WERE STUCK IN A MASS OF PUDDING PROTONS. IN 1909 A SCIENTIST NAMED ERNEST RUTHERFORD USED THE GEIGER MARSDEN EXPERIMENT TO PROVE THAT MOST OF AN ATOM IS IN A VERY SMALL SPACE CALLED THE ATOMIC NUCLEUS. RUTHERFORD TOOK A PHOTO PLATE AND COVERED IT WITH GOLD FOIL AND THEN SHOT ALPHA PARTICLES MADE OF TWO PROTONS AND TWO NEUTRONS STUCK TOGETHER AT IT. MANY OF THE PARTICLES WENT THROUGH THE GOLD FOIL WHICH PROVED THAT ATOMS ARE MOSTLY EMPTY SPACE. ELECTRONS ARE SO SMALL THEY MAKE UP ONLY 1 OF AN ATOM S MASS.
IN 1913 NIELS BOHR INTRODUCED THE BOHR MODEL. THIS MODEL SHOWED THAT ELECTRONS TRAVEL AROUND THE NUCLEUS IN FIXED CIRCULAR ORBITS. THIS WAS MORE ACCURATE THAN THE RUTHERFORD MODEL. HOWEVER IT WAS STILL NOT COMPLETELY RIGHT. IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BOHR MODEL HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED.
IN 1925 CHEMIST FREDERICK SODDY FOUND THAT SOME ELEMENTS IN THE PERIODIC TABLE HAD MORE THAN ONE KIND OF ATOM. 
FOR EXAMPLE ANY ATOM WITH 2 PROTONS SHOULD BE A HELIUM ATOM. USUALLY A HELIUM NUCLEUS ALSO CONTAINS TWO NEUTRONS. HOWEVER SOME HELIUM ATOMS HAVE ONLY ONE NEUTRON. THIS MEANS THEY TRULY ARE HELIUM BECAUSE AN ELEMENT IS DEFINED BY THE NUMBER OF PROTONS BUT THEY ARE NOT NORMAL HELIUM EITHER. SODDY CALLED AN ATOM LIKE THIS WITH A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF NEUTRONS AN ISOTOPE. TO GET THE NAME OF THE ISOTOPE WE LOOK AT HOW MANY PROTONS AND NEUTRONS IT HAS IN ITS NUCLEUS AND ADD THIS TO THE NAME OF THE ELEMENT. SO A HELIUM ATOM WITH TWO PROTONS AND ONE NEUTRON IS CALLED HELIUM 3 AND A CARBON ATOM WITH SIX PROTONS AND SIX NEUTRONS IS CALLED CARBON 12. HOWEVER WHEN HE DEVELOPED HIS THEORY SODDY COULD NOT BE CERTAIN NEUTRONS ACTUALLY EXISTED. TO PROVE THEY WERE REAL PHYSICIST JAMES CHADWICK AND A TEAM OF OTHERS CREATED THE MASS SPECTROMETER. THE MASS SPECTROMETER ACTUALLY MEASURES THE MASS AND WEIGHT OF INDIVIDUAL ATOMS. BY DOING THIS CHADWICK PROVED THAT TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE WEIGHT OF THE ATOM NEUTRONS MUST EXIST.
IN 1937 GERMAN CHEMIST OTTO HAHN BECAME THE FIRST PERSON TO CREATE NUCLEAR FISSION IN A LABORATORY. HE DISCOVERED THIS BY CHANCE WHEN HE WAS SHOOTING NEUTRONS AT A URANIUM ATOM HOPING TO CREATE A NEW ISOTOPE. HOWEVER HE NOTICED THAT INSTEAD OF A NEW ISOTOPE THE URANIUM SIMPLY CHANGED INTO A BARIUM ATOM A SMALLER ATOM THAN URANIUM. APPARENTLY HAHN HAD BROKEN THE URANIUM ATOM. THIS WAS THE WORLD S FIRST RECORDED NUCLEAR FISSION REACTION. THIS DISCOVERY EVENTUALLY LED TO THE CREATION OF THE ATOMIC BOMB.
FURTHER INTO THE 20TH CENTURY PHYSICISTS WENT DEEPER INTO THE MYSTERIES OF THE ATOM. USING PARTICLE ACCELERATORS THEY DISCOVERED THAT PROTONS AND NEUTRONS WERE ACTUALLY MADE OF OTHER PARTICLES CALLED QUARKS.
THE MOST ACCURATE MODEL SO FAR COMES FROM THE SCHR DINGER EQUATION. SCHR DINGER REALIZED THAT THE ELECTRONS EXIST IN A CLOUD AROUND THE NUCLEUS CALLED THE ELECTRON CLOUD. IN THE ELECTRON CLOUD IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE ELECTRONS ARE. THE SCHR DINGER EQUATION IS USED TO FIND OUT WHERE AN ELECTRON IS LIKELY TO BE. THIS AREA IS CALLED THE ELECTRON S ORBITAL.
THE COMPLEX ATOM IS MADE UP OF THREE MAIN PARTICLES THE PROTON THE NEUTRON AND THE ELECTRON. THE ISOTOPE OF HYDROGEN HYDROGEN 1 HAS NO NEUTRONS JUST THE ONE PROTON AND ONE ELECTRON. A POSITIVE HYDROGEN ION HAS NO ELECTRONS JUST THE ONE PROTON AND ONE NEUTRON. THESE TWO EXAMPLES ARE THE ONLY KNOWN EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE THAT ALL OTHER ATOMS HAVE AT LEAST ONE PROTON ONE NEUTRON AND ONE ELECTRON EACH.
ELECTRONS ARE BY FAR THE SMALLEST OF THE THREE ATOMIC PARTICLES THEIR MASS AND SIZE IS TOO SMALL TO BE MEASURED USING CURRENT TECHNOLOGY. THEY HAVE A NEGATIVE CHARGE. PROTONS AND NEUTRONS ARE OF SIMILAR SIZE AND WEIGHT TO EACH OTHER PROTONS ARE POSITIVELY CHARGED AND NEUTRONS HAVE NO CHARGE. 
MOST ATOMS HAVE A NEUTRAL CHARGE BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF PROTONS POSITIVE AND ELECTRONS NEGATIVE ARE THE SAME THE CHARGES BALANCE OUT TO ZERO. HOWEVER IN IONS DIFFERENT NUMBER OF ELECTRONS THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE AND THEY CAN HAVE A POSITIVE OR A NEGATIVE CHARGE. PROTONS AND NEUTRONS ARE MADE OUT OF QUARKS OF TWO TYPES UP QUARKS AND DOWN QUARKS. A PROTON IS MADE OF TWO UP QUARKS AND ONE DOWN QUARK AND A NEUTRON IS MADE OF TWO DOWN QUARKS AND ONE UP QUARK.
THE NUCLEUS IS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ATOM. IT IS MADE UP OF PROTONS AND NEUTRONS. USUALLY IN NATURE TWO THINGS WITH THE SAME CHARGE REPEL OR SHOOT AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. SO FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS A MYSTERY TO SCIENTISTS HOW THE POSITIVELY CHARGED PROTONS IN THE NUCLEUS STAYED TOGETHER. THEY SOLVED THIS BY FINDING A PARTICLE CALLED A GLUON. ITS NAME COMES FROM THE WORD GLUE AS GLUONS ACT LIKE ATOMIC GLUE STICKING THE PROTONS TOGETHER USING THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE. IT IS THIS FORCE WHICH ALSO HOLDS THE QUARKS TOGETHER THAT MAKE UP THE PROTONS AND NEUTRONS.
THE NUMBER OF NEUTRONS IN RELATION TO PROTONS DEFINES WHETHER THE NUCLEUS IS STABLE OR GOES THROUGH RADIOACTIVE DECAY. WHEN THERE ARE TOO MANY NEUTRONS OR PROTONS THE ATOM TRIES TO MAKE THE NUMBERS THE SAME BY GETTING RID OF THE EXTRA PARTICLES. IT DOES THIS BY EMITTING RADIATION IN THE FORM OF ALPHA BETA OR GAMMA DECAY. NUCLEI CAN CHANGE THROUGH OTHER MEANS TOO. NUCLEAR FISSION IS WHEN THE NUCLEUS SPLITS INTO TWO SMALLER NUCLEI RELEASING A LOT OF STORED ENERGY. THIS RELEASE OF ENERGY IS WHAT MAKES NUCLEAR FISSION USEFUL FOR MAKING BOMBS AND ELECTRICITY IN THE FORM OF NUCLEAR POWER. 
THE OTHER WAY NUCLEI CAN CHANGE IS THROUGH NUCLEAR FUSION WHEN TWO NUCLEI JOIN TOGETHER OR FUSE TO MAKE A HEAVIER NUCLEUS. THIS PROCESS REQUIRES EXTREME AMOUNTS OF ENERGY IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THE ELECTROSTATIC REPULSION BETWEEN THE PROTONS AS THEY HAVE THE SAME CHARGE. SUCH HIGH ENERGIES ARE MOST COMMON IN STARS LIKE OUR SUN WHICH FUSES HYDROGEN FOR FUEL.
ELECTRONS ORBIT OR TRAVEL AROUND THE NUCLEUS. THEY ARE CALLED THE ATOM S ELECTRON CLOUD. THEY ARE ATTRACTED TOWARDS THE NUCLEUS BECAUSE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE. ELECTRONS HAVE A NEGATIVE CHARGE AND THE NUCLEUS ALWAYS HAS A POSITIVE CHARGE SO THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER. 
AROUND THE NUCLEUS SOME ELECTRONS ARE FURTHER OUT THAN OTHERS IN DIFFERENT LAYERS. THESE ARE CALLED ELECTRON SHELLS. IN MOST ATOMS THE FIRST SHELL HAS TWO ELECTRONS AND ALL AFTER THAT HAVE EIGHT. EXCEPTIONS ARE RARE BUT THEY DO HAPPEN AND ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE FURTHER AWAY THE ELECTRON IS FROM THE NUCLEUS THE WEAKER THE PULL OF THE NUCLEUS ON IT. THIS IS WHY BIGGER ATOMS WITH MORE ELECTRONS REACT MORE EASILY WITH OTHER ATOMS.
THE ELECTROMAGNETISM OF THE NUCLEUS IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD ONTO THEIR ELECTRONS AND ATOMS LOSE ELECTRONS TO THE STRONG ATTRACTION OF SMALLER ATOMS.
SOME ELEMENTS AND MANY ISOTOPES HAVE WHAT IS CALLED AN UNSTABLE NUCLEUS. THIS MEANS THE NUCLEUS IS EITHER TOO BIG TO HOLD ITSELF TOGETHER OR HAS TOO MANY PROTONS OR NEUTRONS. WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE NUCLEUS HAS TO GET RID OF THE EXCESS MASS OR PARTICLES. IT DOES THIS THROUGH RADIATION. AN ATOM THAT DOES THIS CAN BE CALLED RADIOACTIVE. UNSTABLE ATOMS CONTINUE TO BE RADIOACTIVE UNTIL THEY LOSE ENOUGH MASS PARTICLES THAT THEY BECOME STABLE. ALL ATOMS ABOVE ATOMIC NUMBER 82 82 PROTONS LEAD ARE RADIOACTIVE.
THERE ARE THREE MAIN TYPES OF RADIOACTIVE DECAY ALPHA BETA AND GAMMA.
EVERY RADIOACTIVE ELEMENT OR ISOTOPE HAS WHAT IS NAMED A HALF LIFE. THIS IS HOW LONG IT TAKES HALF OF ANY SAMPLE OF ATOMS OF THAT TYPE TO DECAY UNTIL THEY BECOME A DIFFERENT STABLE ISOTOPE OR ELEMENT. LARGE ATOMS OR ISOTOPES WITH A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF PROTONS AND NEUTRONS WILL THEREFORE HAVE A LONG HALF LIFE BECAUSE THEY MUST LOSE MORE NEUTRONS TO BECOME STABLE.
MARIE CURIE DISCOVERED THE FIRST FORM OF RADIATION. SHE FOUND THE ELEMENT AND NAMED IT RADIUM. SHE WAS ALSO THE FIRST FEMALE RECIPIENT OF THE NOBEL PRIZE.
FREDERICK SODDY CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENT TO OBSERVE WHAT HAPPENS AS RADIUM DECAYS. HE PLACED A SAMPLE IN A LIGHT BULB AND WAITED FOR IT TO DECAY. SUDDENLY HELIUM CONTAINING 2 PROTONS AND 2 NEUTRONS APPEARED IN THE BULB AND FROM THIS EXPERIMENT HE DISCOVERED THIS TYPE OF RADIATION HAS A POSITIVE CHARGE.
JAMES CHADWICK DISCOVERED THE NEUTRON BY OBSERVING DECAY PRODUCTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES. CHADWICK NOTICED THAT THE ATOMIC NUMBER OF THE ELEMENTS WAS LOWER THAN THE TOTAL ATOMIC MASS OF THE ATOM. HE CONCLUDED THAT ELECTRONS COULD NOT BE THE CAUSE OF THE EXTRA MASS BECAUSE THEY BARELY HAVE MASS.
ENRICO FERMI USED THE NEUTRONS TO SHOOT THEM AT URANIUM. HE DISCOVERED THAT URANIUM DECAYED A LOT FASTER THAN USUAL AND PRODUCED A LOT OF ALPHA AND BETA PARTICLES. HE ALSO BELIEVED THAT URANIUM GOT CHANGED INTO A NEW ELEMENT HE NAMED HESPERIUM.
OTTO HANH AND FRITZ STRASSMANN REPEATED FERMI S EXPERIMENT TO SEE IF THE NEW ELEMENT HESPERIUM WAS ACTUALLY CREATED. THEY DISCOVERED TWO NEW THINGS FERMI DID NOT OBSERVE. BY USING A LOT OF NEUTRONS THE NUCLEUS OF THE ATOM WOULD SPLIT PRODUCING A LOT OF HEAT ENERGY. ALSO THE FISSION PRODUCTS OF URANIUM WERE ALREADY DISCOVERED THORIUM PALLADIUM RADIUM RADON AND LEAD.
FERMI THEN NOTICED THAT THE FISSION OF ONE URANIUM ATOM SHOT OFF MORE NEUTRONS WHICH THEN SPLIT OTHER ATOMS CREATING CHAIN REACTIONS. HE REALISED THAT THIS PROCESS IS CALLED NUCLEAR FISSION AND COULD CREATE HUGE AMOUNTS OF HEAT ENERGY.
THAT VERY DISCOVERY OF FERMI S LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIRST NUCLEAR BOMB CODE NAMED TRINITY.
BACTERIA
BACTERIA SING. BACTERIUM ARE VERY SMALL ORGANISMS. THEY ARE PROKARYOTIC MICROORGANISMS. BACTERIAL CELLS DO NOT HAVE A NUCLEUS AND MOST HAVE NO ORGANELLES WITH MEMBRANES AROUND THEM. MOST HAVE A CELL WALL. THEY DO HAVE DNA AND THEIR BIOCHEMISTRY IS BASICALLY THE SAME AS OTHER LIVING THINGS. 
THEY ARE AMONGST THE SIMPLEST AND THE OLDEST ORGANISMS. THEY FUNCTION AS INDEPENDENT ORGANISMS. 
ALMOST ALL BACTERIA ARE SO TINY THEY CAN ONLY BE SEEN THROUGH A MICROSCOPE. BACTERIA ARE MADE UP OF ONE CELL SO THEY ARE A KIND OF UNICELLULAR ORGANISM. THEY ARE AMONG THE SIMPLEST SINGLE CELLED ORGANISMS ON EARTH AND WERE ONE OF THE EARLIEST FORMS OF LIFE. THEY INCLUDE A NUMBER OF EXTREMOPHILES WHICH LIVE IN EXTREME HABITATS.
THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE INDIVIDUAL BACTERIA THAN ANY OTHER SORT OF ORGANISM ON THE PLANET. MOST BACTERIA LIVE IN THE GROUND OR IN WATER BUT MANY LIVE INSIDE OR ON THE SKIN OF OTHER ORGANISMS INCLUDING HUMANS. THERE ARE ABOUT TEN TIMES AS MANY BACTERIAL CELLS AS HUMAN CELLS IN EACH OF OUR BODIES. SOME BACTERIA CAN CAUSE DISEASES BUT OTHERS HELP US IN EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES LIKE DIGESTING FOOD GUT FLORA. SOME EVEN WORK FOR US IN FACTORIES PRODUCING CHEESE AND YOGURT.
THE FOUNDER OF BACTERIOLOGY WAS A GERMAN BIOLOGIST CALLED FERDINAND COHN 18281898. HE PUBLISHED THE FIRST BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF BACTERIA BASED ON THEIR APPEARANCE.
A BACTERIUM REPRODUCES CREATES MORE BACTERIA BY DIVIDING IN HALF AND CREATING TWO DAUGHTER CELLS. EACH DAUGHTER IS IDENTICAL IN SHAPE TO THE PARENT BUT IS SMALLER.
BACTERIA DO NOT HAVE SEXES BUT THEY DO TRANSMIT DNA BY SEVERAL KINDS OF HORIZONTAL GENE TRANSFER. THIS IS HOW THEY SHARE RESISTANCE TO ANTIBIOTICS FROM ONE STRAIN TO ANOTHER. THE COMPLETE DNA SEQUENCE IS KNOWN FOR MANY BACTERIAL STRAINS.
BACTERIA VARY WIDELY IN SIZE AND SHAPE BUT IN GENERAL THEY ARE AT LEAST TEN TIMES LARGER THAN VIRUSES. A TYPICAL BACTERIUM IS ABOUT 1 M ONE MICROMETER IN DIAMETER SO A THOUSAND BACTERIA LINED UP WOULD BE ONE MILLIMETER LONG. THERE ARE ABOUT FIVE NONILLION 5 10 BACTERIA ON EARTH.
BACTERIA ARE IDENTIFIED AND GROUPED BY THEIR SHAPES. BACILLI ARE ROD SHAPED COCCI ARE BALL SHAPED SPIRILLA ARE SPIRAL SHAPED AND VIBRIO ARE SHAPED LIKE A COMMA OR A BOOMERANG.
PATHOGENIC BACTERIA THE HARMFUL KIND ENTER THE HUMAN BODY FROM THE AIR WATER OR FOOD. ONCE INSIDE THESE BACTERIA ATTACH THEMSELVES TO OR INVADE SPECIFIC CELLS IN OUR RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DIGESTIVE TRACT OR IN ANY OPEN WOUND. THERE THEY BEGIN TO REPRODUCE AND SPREAD WHILE USING YOUR BODY S FOOD AND NUTRIENTS TO GIVE THEM ENERGY TO HELP THEM REPRODUCE.
SOME BACTERIA ARE EXTREMOPHILES. SOME MICROBES THRIVE INSIDE ROCKS UP TO 580 METERS BELOW THE SEA FLOOR UNDER 2.6 KILOMETERS OF OCEAN OFF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST OF THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS YOU CAN FIND MICROBES EVERYWHERE THEY RE EXTREMELY ADAPTABLE TO CONDITIONS AND SURVIVE WHEREVER THEY ARE. 
ALL MODERN IDEAS START WITH THE SEQUENCE ANALYSIS OF DNA AND RNA. IN 1987 CARL WOESE THE FORERUNNER OF THE MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY REVOLUTION DIVIDED BACTERIA INTO 11 DIVISIONS BASED ON 16S RIBOSOMAL RNA SSU SEQUENCES 
BALLROOM DANCE
BALLROOM DANCING IS USUALLY A FORM OF ELEGANCY.
BALLROOM DANCE IS THE NAME FOR A NUMBER OF DANCES DONE IN BALLROOMS. IT USUALLY MEANS PAIRS MOSTLY A MAN AND WOMAN DANCING SEPARATELY FROM OTHER PAIRS. THE MOST IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IN STYLE IS BETWEEN THE MODERN OR STANDARD DANCES AND THE LATIN DANCES. THE MODERN DANCES ARE THE WALTZ QUICKSTEP FOXTROT TANGO AND VIENNESE WALTZ. THE LATIN DANCES ARE THE CHA CHA CHA SAMBA RUMBA PASO DOBLE AND JIVE. HOWEVER THERE ARE ALSO SEQUENCE DANCES WHERE DANCERS MOVE TOGETHER IN A PRE SET PATTERN. 
ALL THESE DANCES CAN BE DANCED SOCIALLY MORE OR LESS ANY WAY PEOPLE WANT TO. AS COMPETITION DANCES THEY ARE ORGANISED UNDER THE RULE OF THE WORLD DANCE COUNCIL. THESE COMPETITIONS ARE DANCED IN THE INTERNATIONAL STYLE THE TECHNIQUES WERE DEVELOPED BY ENGLISH DANCERS IN THE 20TH CENTURY. ALL MAJOR INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIONS ARE CONDUCTED WITHIN DETAILED REGULATIONS. THERE ARE OTHER SYSTEMS OF DANCE REGULATED BY NATIONAL BODIES. AMERICAN STYLE IS ONE SCOTTISH DANCING IS ANOTHER GREEK CLASSICAL DANCE IS ANOTHER. 
ALTHOUGH THE MOST FAMOUS DANCERS WERE FRED ASTAIRE AND GINGER ROGERS THEY DID NOT DANCE IN BALLROOMS. THEIR CAREER TOGETHER WAS ENTIRELY ON FILM. ASTAIRE DANCED ALSO ON THE STAGE AND ON TELEVISION. THE MOST FAMOUS AMERICAN PAIR OF BALLROOM DANCERS WAS VERNON AND IRENE CASTLE WHO WERE NATIONAL FIGURES UNTIL VERNON S DEATH IN 1918. LATER ARTHUR MURRAY S CHAIN OF DANCE SCHOOLS TAUGHT MANY AMERICANS TO DANCE. THE MOST FAMOUS ENGLISH BALLROOM DANCER WAS PROBABLY VICTOR SILVESTER WHO WAS A PROFESSIONAL DANCER AND A VERY SUCCESSFUL BANDLEADER.
THERE ARE TEN INTERNATIONAL STYLE BALLROOM DANCES FIVE STANDARD OR MODERN AND FIVE LATIN 
MOST OF THESE ARE DANCES THAT STARTED IN OTHER PLACES BUT WERE DEVELOPED IN THEIR MODERN FORM BY ENGLISH DANCERS AND DANCE TEACHERS.
MOST PEOPLE DO THESE DANCES FOR FUN. WHEN PEOPLE COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER THE WOMEN WEAR FORMAL DRESSES GOWNS FOR STANDARD COMPETITION AND SHORT SKIRTS FOR LATIN. MEN WEAR FORMAL EVENING WEAR WHITE TIE AND TAILS FOR STANDARD AND INFORMAL SHIRTS FOR LATIN.
SOME PEOPLE EARN MEDALS TO SHOW HOW THEY ARE IMPROVING. THEY DANCE IN FRONT OF A JUDGE TO EARN A MEDAL AT THE BRONZE SILVER OR GOLD LEVELS. BALLROOM DANCE TEACHING AND MEDAL AWARDS IS DONE BY DANCE TEACHER ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE IMPERIAL SOCIETY OF TEACHERS OF DANCING ISTD OR THE INTERNATIONAL DANCE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION IDTA. THESE ORGANISATIONS ALSO DO BALLET STAGE DANCING OR THEATRE DANCE OR JAZZ DANCE AND SEVERAL OTHER TYPES OF DANCE. THEIR QUALIFICATIONS AND EXAMS ARE HELD WORLD WIDE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ENGLISH IN ORIGIN. STREET DANCE AS THE NAME SUGGESTS DOES NOT NEED A BALLROOM. NEVERTHELESS IT IS BEING TAUGHT IN BALLROOMS AS ARE SOME OTHER KINDS OF NON TRADITIONAL DANCE.
THERE ARE ALSO SOME LINE DANCES IN WHICH PEOPLE DANCE AS A GROUP INSTEAD OF WITH A PARTNER. SOME LINE DANCES ARE DONE TO MAMBO WALTZ PASO DOBLE AND SAMBA.
SOME PEOPLE DANCE IN COUPLES BUT ALSO AS A GROUP WITH EVERYONE DOING THE SAME STEPS. THIS IS CALLED FORMATION DANCING.
PEOPLE COMPETE AT MANY LEVELS BUT THE BASIC DIVISION IS BETWEEN AMATEURS AND PROFESSIONALS. THEN AMONGST AMATEURS THERE ARE AGE GRADES BRITISH REGULATIONS 
IN THE USA COMPETITIONS MAY BE DIVIDED ACCORDING TO DANCING ABILITY NEWCOMER PRE BRONZE BRONZE SILVER GOLD PRE CHAMPIONSHIP AND CHAMPIONSHIP. 
THE BEST KNOWN COMPETITION IS THE BLACKPOOL DANCE FESTIVAL ENGLAND. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ANNUALLY SINCE 1920 EXCEPT FOR WAR YEARS AND ITS EVENTS LIKE MOST ENGLISH EVENTS ARE OPEN TO THE WORLD.
AMERICAN STYLE BALLROOM DANCING IS SOMETIMES CALLED SOCIAL STYLE. IT INCLUDES SMOOTH AND RHYTHM DANCES 
BASQUE LANGUAGE
BASQUE IN BASQUE IS THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN BY THE BASQUE PEOPLE IN THE BASQUE COUNTRY AND DIASPORA. THE STANDARD BASQUE NAME FOR THE LANGUAGE IS EUSKARA. ALTHOUGH IT IS SURROUNDED BY INDO EUROPEAN LANGUAGES BASQUE IS A LANGUAGE ISOLATE. IT IS NOT RELATED TO THE INDO EUROPEAN LANGUAGES. 
THE ANCESTORS OF BASQUES ARE AMONG THE OLDEST RESIDENTS OF EUROPE AND THEIR BEGINNINGS ARE UNKNOWN AS ARE THE ORIGINS OF BASQUE ITSELF. MANY SCHOLARS HAVE TRIED TO LINK BASQUE TO ETRUSCAN AFRICAN LANGUAGES CAUCASIAN LANGUAGES AND SO ON BUT MOST SEE BASQUE AS A LANGUAGE ISOLATE. 
A CONNECTION WITH THE IBERIAN LANGUAGE GAVE SOME HOPE BUT IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER SIMILARITIES ARE DUE TO GENETIC RELATIONS OR MERE VICINITY.
IT WAS SPOKEN LONG BEFORE THE ROMANS BROUGHT LATIN TO THE IBERIAN PENINSULA.
THE REGION WHERE BASQUE IS SPOKEN IS SMALLER THAN WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE BASQUE COUNTRY OR EUSKAL HERRIA IN BASQUE. BASQUE USED TO BE SPOKEN OVER A LARGER AREA BUT LATIN TOOK OVER IN SOME PLACES.
HISTORICALLY LATIN OR ROMANCE HAS BEEN THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE.
TODAY BASQUE HOLDS CO OFFICIAL LANGUAGE STATUS IN THE BASQUE REGIONS OF SPAIN THE FULL AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY AND SOME PARTS OF NAVARRE. BASQUE HAS NO OFFICIAL STANDING IN THE NORTHERN BASQUE COUNTRY OF FRANCE AND FRENCH CITIZENS ARE BARRED FROM USING BASQUE IN A FRENCH COURT OF LAW.
THERE ARE SIX MAIN BASQUE DIALECTS COMPRISING BISCAYAN GUIPUZCOAN AND HIGH NAVARRESE IN SPAIN AND LOW NAVARRESE LABOURDIN AND SOULETIN IN FRANCE. THE DIALECT BOUNDARIES ARE NOT HOWEVER CONGRUENT WITH POLITICAL BOUNDARIES. 
ONE OF THE FIRST SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OF BASQUE DIALECTS IN PARTICULAR THE AUXILIARY VERB FORMS WAS MADE BY LOUIS LUCIEN BONAPARTE A NEPHEW OF NAPOLEON.
THERE IS NOW A UNIFIED VERSION OF EUSKARA CALLED BATUA UNIFIED IN BASQUE WHICH IS THE LANGUAGE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS. BATUA IS BASED LARGELY ON THE GIPUZKOA REGIONAL DIALECT.
BASQUE IS AN ERGATIVE ABSOLUTIVE LANGUAGE. IT IS VERY COMPLICATED HAVING MANY DIFFERENT CASES FOR NOUNS.
THE VOWEL SYSTEM IS THE SAME AS SPANISH FOR MOST SPEAKERS. IT CONSISTS OF FIVE PURE VOWELS. 
BY CONTACT WITH NEIGHBOURING PEOPLES BASQUE HAS BORROWED WORDS FROM LATIN SPANISH FRENCH GASCON AMONG OTHERS BUT ACCEPTED RELATIVELY FEW COMPARED TO MANY INDO EUROPEAN LANGUAGES. SOME CLAIM THAT MANY OF ITS WORDS COME FROM LATIN BUT PHONETIC EVOLUTION HAS MADE MANY OF THEM APPEAR NOWADAYS AS IF THEY WERE NATIVE WORDS E.G. LORE FLOWER FROM FLOREM ERROTA MILL FROM ROTAM MILL WHEEL GELA ROOM FROM CELLAM.
BASQUE IS WRITTEN USING THE LATIN ALPHABET. THE UNIVERSAL SPECIAL LETTER IS WHICH IS PRONOUNCED LIKE THE N IN ONION SOMETIMES AND ARE ALSO USED. BASQUE DOES NOT USE C Q V W Y EXCEPT FOR LOAN WORDS THEY ARE NOT CONSIDERED PART OF THE ALPHABET. THE X IS PRONOUNCED AS A SH AS IN SHINE.
BEE
BEES ARE FLYING INSECTS OF THE HYMENOPTERA WHICH ALSO INCLUDES ANTS WASPS AND SAWFLIES. THERE ARE ABOUT 20 000 SPECIES OF BEES. BEES COLLECT POLLEN FROM FLOWERS. BEES CAN BE FOUND ON ALL CONTINENTS EXCEPT ANTARCTICA.
BEES FALL INTO FOUR GROUPS 
THE EUROPEAN HONEY BEE CALLED APIS MELLIFERA BY BIOLOGISTS IS KEPT BY HUMANS FOR HONEY. KEEPING BEES TO MAKE HONEY IS CALLED BEEKEEPING OR APICULTURE.
THE EARLIEST ANIMAL POLLINATED FLOWERS WERE POLLINATED BY INSECTS SUCH AS BEETLES LONG BEFORE BEES FIRST APPEARED. BEES ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE SPECIALIZED AS POLLINATION AGENTS WITH BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSICAL MODIFICATIONS THAT MAKE POLLINATION EASIER. BEES ARE GENERALLY BETTER AT THE TASK THAN OTHER POLLINATING INSECTS SUCH AS BEETLES FLIES BUTTERFLIES AND POLLEN WASPS. THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH FLORAL SPECIALISTS IS BELIEVED TO HAVE DRIVEN THE ADAPTIVE RADIATION OF THE ANGIOSPERMS AND IN TURN THE BEES THEMSELVES.
BEES LIKE ANTS ARE A SPECIALIZED FORM OF WASP. THE ANCESTORS OF BEES WERE WASPS IN A FAMILY WHICH PREYED ON OTHER INSECTS. THE SWITCH FROM INSECT PREY TO POLLEN MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM THE CAPTURE OF PREY INSECTS THAT WERE COVERED WITH POLLEN WHEN THEY WERE FED TO THE WASP LARVAE. SIMILAR BEHAVIOUR COULD BE SWITCHED TO POLLEN COLLECTION. THIS SAME EVOLUTIONARY SCENARIO HAS OCCURRED WITHIN THE VESPOID WASPS WHERE THE GROUP KNOWN AS POLLEN WASPS ALSO EVOLVED FROM PREDATORY ANCESTORS. 
A RECENTLY REPORTED BEE FOSSIL OF THE GENUS MELITTOSPHEX IS CONSIDERED AN EXTINCT LINEAGE OF POLLEN COLLECTING APOIDEA SISTER GROUP TO THE MODERN BEES AND DATES FROM THE LOWER CRETACEOUS 100 MYA. FEATURES OF ITS MORPHOLOGY PLACE IT CLEARLY WITHIN THE BEES BUT IT RETAINS TWO UNMODIFIED ANCESTRAL TRAITS OF THE LEGS WHICH BETRAY ITS ORIGIN. THE ISSUE IS STILL UNDER DEBATE AND THE PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS AMONG BEE FAMILIES ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD.
LIKE OTHER INSECTS THE BODY OF A BEE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS THE HEAD THORAX THE MIDDLE PART AND ABDOMEN THE BACK PART. ALSO LIKE OTHER INSECTS BEES HAVE THREE PAIRS OF LEGS AND TWO PAIRS OF WINGS. MANY BEES ARE HAIRY AND HAVE YELLOW AND BLACK OR ORANGE AND BLACK WARNING COLORS.
MANY BEES HAVE STINGS LIKE A HOLLOW NEEDLE ON THE REAR OF THEIR BODIES. IF THEY GET CONFUSED ANGRY OR SCARED THEY MAY STING AND INJECT VENOM WHICH HURTS. ONCE A WORKER BEE HAS STUNG IT DIES AFTER A SHORT WHILE BUT OTHER TYPES OF BEE AND WASP CAN STING AGAIN. SOME PEOPLE ARE ALLERGIC TO BEE STINGS AND CAN EVEN DIE FROM THEM.
SOME BEES ARE EUSOCIAL INSECTS THIS MEANS THEY LIVE IN ORGANIZED GROUPS CALLED COLONIES. HONEY BEES THE KIND OF BEE USED IN BEEKEEPING ARE EUSOCIAL. THE HOME OF A BEE COLONY IS CALLED A HIVE. 
THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF BEES IN A HONEY BEE COLONY. A QUEEN BEE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT BEE IN THE COLONY BECAUSE SHE WILL LAY THE EGGS. THE QUEEN BEE ONLY USES HER STINGER TO STING OTHER QUEEN BEES. THE QUEEN IS USUALLY THE MOTHER OF THE WORKER BEES. SHE ATE A SPECIAL JELLY CALLED ROYAL JELLY FROM WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG. WORKER BEES ARE FEMALES TOO AND THEY ARE THE BEES THAT COLLECT POLLEN FROM FLOWERS AND WILL FIGHT TO PROTECT THE COLONY. WORKERS DO A WAGGLE DANCE TO TELL THE OTHERS WHERE THEY HAVE FOUND NECTAR KARL VON FRISCH DISCOVERED THIS.
DRONE BEES MALES MATE WITH THE QUEEN BEE SO THAT SHE CAN LAY EGGS. THE ONLY FUNCTION OF THE MALE DRONE IS TO MATE. THEY DO NO OTHER WORK IN THE HIVE.
BEETLE
BEETLES THE ORDER COLEOPTERA ARE THE LARGEST GROUP OF INSECTS. THERE ARE 350 000 DIFFERENT SPECIES OF BEETLES WHICH HAVE BEEN NAMED ABOUT 40 OF ALL KNOWN INSECTS. THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 800 000 TO A MILLION LIVING SPECIES. BEETLES LIVE ALMOST EVERYWHERE THOUGH NOT IN THE OCEAN OR IN PLACES THAT ARE VERY COLD SUCH AS ANTARCTICA.
BEETLES WENT THROUGH A MASSIVE ADAPTIVE RADIATION EARLY IN THEIR EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY. THE EVOLUTION OF FLOWERING PLANTS HELPED DRIVE THE DIVERSIFICATION OF BEETLES. FOUR OF THE SIX BIGGEST FAMILIES OF BEETLES MAINLY EAT FLOWERING PLANTS. 
IN COMMON WITH OTHER INSECTS THERE ARE THREE MAIN PARTS TO A BEETLE S BODY THE HEAD THE THORAX THE MIDDLE PART AND THE ABDOMEN THE BACK PART. ON THE HEAD BEETLES HAVE ANTENNAE FEELERS EYES AND A MOUTH. THE LEGS AND WINGS OF THE BEETLE ARE ATTACHED TO THE THORAX. THE ABDOMEN OF A BEETLE DOES NOT USUALLY HAVE SPECIAL PARTS ON THE OUTSIDE BUT IT HAS THE BEETLE S GUT INSIDE. LIKE OTHER INSECTS BEETLES HAVE NO INTERNAL BONES BUT INSTEAD HAVE A HARD EXOSKELETON ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BODY. THE EXOSKELETON IS MADE OF HARD PLATES OF CHITIN. I LIKE TO MOVE MOVE IT 
BEETLES DIFFER FROM OTHER FLYING INSECTS BECAUSE THEIR FRONT WINGS HAVE EVOLVED INTO HARD COVERS OR ELYTRA. THE BACK WINGS ARE USED FOR FLYING. THEY ARE THIN AND ARE KEPT UNDER THE ELYTRA WHEN AT REST. BEETLES LIFT THEIR ELYTRA OUT OF THE WAY IN ORDER TO FLY. A FEW SPECIES OF TRUE BUGS HAVE A SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT. 
NOT ALL BEETLES CAN FLY. SOME BEETLES DO NOT HAVE BACK WINGS AND SOME CANNOT LIFT THEIR FRONT WINGS OUT OF THE WAY. A FEW BEETLES HAVE NO WINGS AT ALL AND CANNOT FLY. SOME BEETLES WITH NO WINGS LOOK LIKE LARVAE AND ARE CALLED LARVIFORM. AN EXAMPLE IS THE FAMILY PHENGODIDAE GLOW WORMS WHERE THE FEMALES ARE LARVIFORM THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES.
THE LEGS OF BEETLES HELP THEM TO WALK RUN SWIM AND DIG. ALL BEETLES HAVE SIX LEGS. EACH LEG IS MADE OUT OF SEVERAL PARTS. THE PARTS ON THE END OF EACH LEG ARE CALLED TARSI. THE LAST TARSUS THE SINGULAR OF TARSI OF EACH BEETLE FOOT HAS ONE OR TWO CLAWS ON THE END OF IT. MOST BEETLES USE THEIR LEGS TO WALK OR RUN. SOME BEETLE LEGS ARE FLAT AND HAVE LONG HAIRS ON THEM. THESE KINDS OF LEGS ARE FOUND ON WATER BEETLES. BEETLES THAT OFTEN DIG IN SOIL HAVE FLAT LEGS WITH SPINES OR HORNS AT THE EDGES. FLAT LEGS WITH HORNS ARE CALLED FOSSORIAL LEGS. A FEW BEETLES HAVE LARGE HIND LEGS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF GRASSHOPPERS WHICH HELP THE BEETLE TO JUMP. FLEA BEETLES ARE AN EXAMPLE OF JUMPING BEETLE.
BEETLES HAVE COMPOUND EYES WHICH MEANS THE TWO BIG SHINY EYES ON THE HEAD ARE ACTUALLY MADE OUT OF MANY SMALLER PARTS. SOMETIMES THE TWO EYES ARE EACH DIVIDED IN HALF SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE FOUR EYES. ONE BEETLE FAMILY THE WHIRLIGIG BEETLES HAS DIVIDED EYES SO THAT WHEN THEY ARE SWIMMING THEY CAN SEE ON TOP OF THE WATER AND UNDER THE WATER AT THE SAME TIME. A FEW BEETLES HAVE EXTRA SIMPLE EYES USUALLY TWO CALLED OCELLI. THE OCELLI ARE ON THE TOP OF THE BEETLE S HEAD.
BECAUSE BEETLES HAVE NO NOSE THEY USE THEIR ANTENNAE TO SMELL THINGS. BEETLES ALSO USE THEIR ANTENNAE TO FEEL THINGS AROUND THEM. SOME BEETLES USE THEIR ANTENNAE TO FIGHT OTHER BEETLES OR EVEN TO FIGHT LARGER ANIMALS THAT WANT TO EAT THEM. BEETLE ANTENNAE DO NOT ALL LOOK THE SAME. SOME ANTENNAE ARE LONG AND THIN WHILE OTHERS ARE SHORT AND WIDE. THIN ANTENNAE ARE CALLED FILIFORM ANTENNAE AND ANTENNAE THAT ARE WIDE ON THE END ARE CALLED CLAVATE ANTENNAE.
THE MOUTH OF A BEETLE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOUTH OF A PERSON. MOST BEETLES HAVE TWO HARD MANDIBLES AT THE FRONT OF THEIR MOUTH WHICH ARE A BIT LIKE TEETH. MANDIBLES HELP THE BEETLE EAT BY CRUSHING AND CUTTING FOOD. IN SOME BEETLES THE MANDIBLES LOOK LIKE BIG PINCERS. BEETLES ALSO HAVE FOUR FINGERS AROUND THEIR MOUTH THAT PUSH FOOD INTO THE MOUTH OF THE BEETLE. THESE FINGERS ARE CALLED PALPI.
BEETLES DO NOT BREATHE INSTEAD THEY HAVE HOLES CALLED SPIRACLES IN THE SIDES OF THEIR BODIES WHICH LEAD TO TRACHEA WHICH ACT LIKE LUNGS. BEETLES DO NOT HAVE BLOOD BUT THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE BLOOD CALLED HAEMOLYMPH. IT IS A GREEN COLOUR. THAT S BECAUSE THEIR HAEMOGLOBIN MOLECULE HAS A COPPER ATOM AT ITS CENTRE WHEREAS OURS HAS AN IRON ATOM THERE.
BEETLES START OUT AS EGGS THAT A FEMALE BEETLE LAYS. SOME BEETLES CAN LAY THOUSANDS OF EGGS DURING THEIR LIVES. A LARVA COMES OUT WHEN AN EGG HATCHES. MOST BEETLE LARVAE DO NOT LOOK LIKE ADULT BEETLES. A BEETLE LARVA EATS AND GROWS LARGER UNTIL IT CHANGES AND BECOMES A PUPA. WHEN THE PUPA OPENS AN ADULT BEETLE SOMETIMES CALLED AN IMAGO COMES OUT. THIS WAY OF GROWING UP IS CALLED COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS.
BEETLES EAT THE MOST WHEN THEY ARE LARVAE. SOME BEETLE LARVAE EAT THE OUTSIDE OF PLANTS SOME EAT INSIDE PLANTS. SOME BEETLE LARVAE ARE PREDATORS WHICH MEANS THEY HUNT FOR OTHER INSECTS TO EAT. OTHER BEETLE LARVAE EAT DEAD THINGS SUCH AS DEAD PLANTS AND DEAD ANIMALS.
NOT ALL BEETLE LARVAE LOOK THE SAME. SOME BEETLE LARVAE ARE FLAT AND MOVE VERY FAST. TO DESCRIBE THESE LARVAE SCIENTISTS USE THE DESCRIPTIVE WORD CAMPODEIFORM. SOME BEETLE LARVAE LOOK SIMILAR TO HARD WORMS WITH TINY LEGS. THESE HAVE AN ELATERIFORM SHAPE. CLICK BEETLE LARVAE HAVE A SPECIAL NAME WIREWORMS. OTHER BEETLE LARVAE ARE SHORT AND VERY THICK AND ARE CALLED GRUBS. IN A FEW BEETLES THE LARVAE CHANGE THEIR SHAPE AFTER SOME TIME. BLISTER BEETLE LARVAE START OUT MOVING FAST SUCH AS CAMPODEIFORM LARVAE BUT END UP SLOW AND THICK.
BEETLES EAT MANY DIFFERENT THINGS INCLUDING LIVING PLANTS ROTTING PLANTS ANIMALS THAT MAY BE DEAD OR ALIVE AND ANIMAL FAECES. SOME BEETLES CAN EAT BOTH PLANTS AND ANIMALS WHILE OTHERS EAT JUST ONE TYPE OF FOOD. BEETLES THAT CAN ONLY EAT ONE KIND OF THING ARE SAID TO BE HOST SPECIFIC. MANY LEAF BEETLES AND LONGHORN BEETLES ARE HOST SPECIFIC.
BEETLES ARE TOUGH ANIMALS FOR THEIR SIZE. THEY ARE MECHANICALLY TOUGH THE ELYTRA AND HAVE A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES TO AVOID BEING ATTACKED BY PREDATORS OR PARASITOIDS. THESE INCLUDE CAMOUFLAGE MIMICRY TOXICITY AND ACTIVE DEFENCE.
SOME BEETLES LIVE IN PLACES THAT ARE HARD FOR PREDATORS TO FIND. SOME BEETLES SUCH AS LONGHORN BEETLES LIVE IN TUNNELS INSIDE TREE BRANCHES. ONLY SPECIAL PREDATORS THAT ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO USE THE LONG HORNED BEETLE TUNNELS CAN EAT THE LONGHORN BEETLES.
OTHER BEETLES DO NOT LIVE IN SPECIAL PLACES BUT THEY HAVE COLOURS OR SHAPES THAT MAKE THEM HARD TO FIND. WHEN BEETLES HAVE COLOURS SO THAT PREDATORS CANNOT SEE THEM THIS IS CALLED CAMOUFLAGE. SOME LEAF BEETLES ARE GREEN SO THAT THEY CAN NOT BE SEEN WHEN THEY ARE ON GREEN LEAVES. SOME BEETLES HAVE VERY COMPLEX COLOURS SO THAT THEY LOOK LIKE BIRD DROPPINGS.
SOMETIMES BEETLES USE COLOUR TO WARN PREDATORS WARNING COLOURATION. SOME BEETLES HAVE BLACK AND YELLOW STRIPES SO THAT THEY LOOK SIMILAR TO BEES AND WASPS. SOME BEETLES EVEN BEHAVE SIMILAR TO BEES TO CONFUSE PREDATORS. 
BEETLES HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF CHEMICAL DEFENCES MOSTLY GOT FROM PLANTS THEIR LARVAE EAT. THESE CHEMICALS MAKE THEM TASTE BAD WHEN PREDATORS EAT THEM. BLISTER BEETLES ARE SO POISONOUS THAT IF A HORSE EATS ONLY A FEW OF THEM THE HORSE MAY DIE BOMBARDIER BEETLES SQUIRT HOT POISONOUS LIQUID AT ATTACKERS. LADY BEETLES PUT OUT A CYANIDE COMPOUND WHEN MOLESTED. LADY BEETLES ALSO HAVE COLOURS THAT WARN PREDATORS THAT THEY TASTE BAD. INSECTS WHICH TASTE FOUL USE WARNING COLOURS WHICH BIRDS LEARN TO AVOID. ALSO OTHER SPECIES WHICH ARE TASTY COPY THOSE WARNING COLOURS. THIS IS A TYPE OF MIMICRY AND IS QUITE COMMON IN INSECTS.
VERY LARGE BEETLES SOMETIMES FIGHT PREDATORS. BEETLES THAT FIGHT WILL OFTEN USE THEIR MANDIBLES TO INJURE THEIR PREDATORS.
BEETLES HAVE SEXUAL REPRODUCTION WHICH MEANS MALES AND FEMALES MATE IN ORDER TO MAKE OFFSPRING.
BEFORE REPRODUCTION MALE BEETLES SOMETIMES FIGHT TO CLAIM A FEMALE. THIS ESPECIALLY HAPPENS WITH STAG BEETLES MALES WILL FIGHT USING THEIR LONG MANDIBLES.
SOME BEETLES GIVE SPECIAL CARE TO THEIR EGGS OR LARVAE. SOME SCARAB BEETLES CALLED DUNG BEETLES ROLL BALLS OF DUNG FAECES AND PUT THEM IN A HOLE IN THE GROUND. THE FEMALE LAYS HER EGGS IN THE DUNG. WHEN THE EGGS HATCH THE LARVAE WILL EAT THE DUNG THAT THEIR MOTHER SUPPLIED FOR THEM.
THERE ARE FOUR EXTANT SUBORDERS OF BEETLES 
DIFFERENT KINDS OF BEETLES CAN BE DIVIDED INTO GROUPS CALLED FAMILIES. THERE ARE MANY BEETLE FAMILIES. THE BIGGEST FAMILIES ARE LISTED HERE.
POPULAR NAMES ARE OFTEN MISLEADING THAT IS WHY BIOLOGISTS USE SCIENTIFIC NAMES IN LATIN. PEOPLE CALL SOME BEETLES BY OTHER NAMES. FIREFLIES ALSO CALLED LIGHTNING BUGS ARE ACTUALLY BEETLES SO ARE LADYBIRDS OR LADYBUGS WHICH BIOLOGISTS CALL LADY BEETLES.
SOME BEETLES CAUSE TROUBLE FOR FARMERS AND PEOPLE IN FORESTS BECAUSE THEY EAT CROPS OR TREES. THESE BEETLES ARE CALLED PESTS. ONE BEETLE THAT HURTS CROPS IS THE COLORADO BEETLE ANOTHER IS THE MAIZE WEEVIL. ONE THAT DESTROYS TREES IS THE EMERALD ASH BORER.
OTHER BEETLES HELP PEOPLE LADY BEETLES ALSO CALLED LADYBIRDS AND LADYBUGS EAT INSECTS THAT HURT CROPS AND TREES.
PEOPLE WHO STUDY BEETLES ARE CALLED COLEOPTERISTS.
BIBLE
THE BIBLE ALSO KNOWN AS HOLY BIBLE IS A GROUP OF RELIGIOUS TEXTS OF JUDAISM OR CHRISTIANITY. THE WORD BIBLE COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD BIBLIA WHICH MEANS BOOKS IN ENGLISH BECAUSE IT IS MANY BOOKS IN ONE BOOK. IT INCLUDES LAWS STORIES PRAYERS SONGS AND WISE WORDS. A NUMBER OF TEXTS ARE BOTH IN THE HEBREW BIBLE USED BY JEWS AND THIS CHRISTIAN ONE. THE ISLAMIC NAME FOR THE BIBLE IS THE INJIL.
WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE BIBLE A BOOK IS USED TO SPEAK ABOUT A NUMBER OF TEXTS. ALL THE TEXTS THAT MAKE A BOOK ARE BELIEVED TO BELONG TOGETHER. MOST OF THE TIME PEOPLE BELIEVE THEY WERE WRITTEN OR COLLECTED BY THE SAME PERSON. THE BIBLE CONTAINS DIFFERENT KINDS OF SUCH BOOKS. SOME ARE HISTORY TELLING THE STORIES OF THE JEWS JESUS OR JESUS FOLLOWERS. SOME ARE COLLECTIONS OF WISE SAYINGS. SOME ARE GOD S COMMANDS TO HIS PEOPLE WHICH HE EXPECTS THEM TO OBEY. SOME ARE SONGS OF PRAISE TO GOD. SOME ARE BOOKS OF PROPHECY MESSAGES FROM GOD THAT HE GAVE THROUGH CHOSEN PEOPLE CALLED PROPHETS.
DIFFERENT GROUPS OF CHRISTIANS DO NOT AGREE WHICH TEXTS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE BIBLE. CHRISTIAN BIBLES RANGE FROM THE 66 BOOKS OF THE PROTESTANT CANON TO 81 BOOKS IN THE ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX BIBLE. THE OLDEST SURVIVING CHRISTIAN BIBLE IS THE CODEX SINAITICUS A GREEK MANUSCRIPT FROM THE FOURTH CENTURY AD. THE OLDEST COMPLETE HEBREW MANUSCRIPTS DATE FROM THE MIDDLE AGES.
FOR A LONG TIME THE TEXTS WERE PASSED ON BY WORD OF MOUTH FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN LONG AGO IN ARAMAIC HEBREW AND GREEK. TRANSLATIONS WERE MADE LATER INTO LATIN AND SOME OTHER LANGUAGES. NOW THERE ARE TRANSLATIONS IN ENGLISH AND MANY OTHER LANGUAGES. THE BOOKS OF THE HEBREW BIBLE WHAT CHRISTIANS CALL THE OLD TESTAMENT WERE NOT ALL WRITTEN AT THE SAME TIME. IT TOOK HUNDREDS OF YEARS ABOUT 1200 YEARS. THE PROCESS OF PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER BEGAN AROUND 400 B.C. THE NEW TESTAMENT WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN GREEK BEGAN TO BE PUT TOGETHER IN ABOUT 100 A.D.
A TRANSLATION IS WHEN A SCRIBE TAKES THE SOURCE IN ONE LANGUAGE AND WRITES IT IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE. MOST TEXTS OF THE BIBLE WERE WRITTEN IN ANCIENT GREEK OR IN ARAMAIC OR HEBREW.
THE FIRST TO PROVIDE A TRANSLATION INTO LATIN WAS JEROME IN THE 5TH CENTURY. HE STARTED WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE VULGATE TODAY. WUFILA TRANSLATED THE BIBLE INTO THE GOTHIC LANGUAGE. IN THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES PEOPLE SUCH AS PETRUS VALDES AND JAN HUS PROVIDED TRANSLATIONS.
THE NEW TESTAMENT WAS FIRST TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH IN 1382 BY JOHN WYCLIFFE AND HIS ASSOCIATES TRANSLATED THE OLD TESTAMENT. THE TRANSLATION WAS MADE FROM THE VULGATE LATIN BIBLE. WYCLIFFE DID THIS SO THAT PEOPLE COULD SEE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT THE BIBLE SAID. THE TRANSLATION WAS COMPLETED IN 1382. THERE WERE SOME LATER EDITIONS BY OTHER PEOPLE TO THE WYCLIFFE BIBLE AS IT IS CALLED. IT WAS TRANSLATED INTO MIDDLE ENGLISH THE LANGUAGE OF HIS DAY. WYCLIFFE DID NOT HAVE CHURCH PERMISSION TO DO THIS BUT HE WAS PROTECTED BY JOHN OF GAUNT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MEN IN THE KINGDOM. AFTER BOTH WYCLIFFE AND HIS PROTECTOR WERE DEAD THE CHURCH DECLARED WYCLIFFE A HERETIC IN 1415 AND BANNED HIS WRITINGS. THE COUNCIL OF CONSTANCE DECREED WYCLIFFE S WORKS SHOULD BE BURNED AND HIS REMAINS EXHUMED DUG UP. WHY WAS THE CHURCH SO OPPOSED THE TRANSLATIONS CHALLENGED THE CHURCH S AUTHORITY OVER THE PEOPLE. IN CHURCH EXPLAINING THE BIBLE WAS THE PRIEST S WORK. WHATEVER HE SAID COULD NOT BE CHALLENGED. ONCE THE ORDINARY PEOPLE COULD READ THE BIBLE THEY MIGHT HAVE OTHER OPINIONS.
THE NEXT STEP IN TRANSLATION WAS DONE IN 1525 BY WILLIAM TYNDALE. HIS TRANSLATION WAS INTO EARLY MODERN ENGLISH WHICH WE CAN JUST ABOUT UNDERSTAND TODAY. TYNDALE ALSO DID IT WITHOUT CHURCH PERMISSION. HIS WAS THE FIRST TRANSLATION TO BE PRINTED AND SEVERAL THOUSAND COPIES WERE MADE. HE HAD NO PROTECTOR AND HIS FATE WAS TERRIBLE. HE FLED TO EUROPE BUT THE AGENTS OF THOMAS MORE CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND AT THE TIME EVENTUALLY FOUND HIM. BOTH TYNDALE AND HIS PRINTER WERE EXECUTED BY BURNING AT THE STAKE.
ANOTHER WELL KNOWN TRANSLATION IS THE 1611 KING JAMES TRANSLATION COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE AUTHORIZED KING JAMES VERSION OF THE BIBLE.
SOME TEXTS WERE WRITTEN BY HISTORIANS WHO TRIED TO SHOW WHAT ANCIENT ISRAEL WAS LIKE. OTHER TEXTS ARE POEMS ABOUT GOD AND HIS WORK. AND OTHERS WERE USED TO MAKE LAWS. FOLLOWERS OF JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY CONSIDER THE BIBLE SACRED BUT THEY DO NOT ALL AGREE ABOUT WHAT BELONGS IN THE BIBLE. WHAT IS CONSIDERED PART OF THE BIBLE CHANGED WITH HISTORY. DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS INCLUDE CERTAIN PARTS OR LEAVE OUT OTHER PARTS. THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE VERSION OF THE BIBLE BOTH THE CONTENT OF THE BOOKS AND THEIR ORDER MAY CHANGE.
LANGUAGES DO NOT MATCH. WHEN A TRANSLATION IS DONE THE TRANSLATOR HAS TO DECIDE BETWEEN TRANSLATION WORD FOR WORD OR CAPTURING THE SENSE OF THE TEXT. WHEN HE DECIDES TO CAPTURE THE SENSE HE WILL CHOOSE OTHER WORDS IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE. THIS IS CALLED PARAPHRASING.
TODAY THERE ARE DOZENS OF VERSIONS OF THE BIBLE. SOME ARE TRANSLATIONS AND SOME ARE PARAPHRASES. A PARAPHRASED VERSION IS WHERE PEOPLE TAKE A TRANSLATION AND PUT IT IN THEIR OWN WORDS. AS THE BIBLE HAS BEEN TRANSLATED INTO MODERN LANGUAGES IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT TRANSLATIONS OF THE SAME TEXTS. THE BIBLE IS THE BEST SELLING BOOK OF ALL TIME. 2.5 BILLION TO MORE THAN 6 BILLION COPIES OF THE BIBLE HAVE BEEN SOLD TO DATE. A COMPLETE VERSION OF THE BIBLE EXISTS IN 471 LANGUAGES. PARTS HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED IN 2225 LANGUAGES. MOST BIBLES CAN BE FOUND IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM IN LONDON.
THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE IS A COLLECTION OF 66 BOOKS. THE FIRST 39 BOOKS ARE THE OLD TESTAMENT. IT IS THE FIRST PART OF THE GOD S STORY OF SALVATION. SALVATION IS GOD S LONG WORK OF SAVING US FROM OUR SINS. SIN IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN PEOPLE DECIDED TO LIVE THEIR OWN WAY INSTEAD OF GOD S WAY IN THE WORLD THAT GOD CREATED. THAT WAS WHEN GOD BEGAN HIS GREAT WORK OF SAVING US FROM OUR SINS.
TO PREPARE THE WAY GOD HAD TO DESTROY THE WHOLE WORLD BY A GREAT FLOOD EXCEPT FOR THE FAMILY OF NOAH. THEN GOD RAISED UP A NEW PEOPLE FOR HIMSELF. THEY WERE THE ANCIENT HEBREWS. GOD PROMISED THE HEBREWS THEY WOULD BRING HIS SALVATION TO THE WHOLE WORLD.
THE FIRST FIVE BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT ARE MOSTLY THE STORY OF HOW GOD CHOSE THE ANCIENT HEBREWS AND TAUGHT THEM HIS LAWS. FOLLOWING THESE ARE THE TWELVE BOOKS THAT TELL THE HISTORY OF THE HEBREWS. THE NEXT FIVE ARE BOOKS OF POETRY AND WISDOM. ONE OF THESE FIVE BOOKS THE PSALMS IS A BOOK OF SONGS SHOWING MAINLY HOW GOD WANTS TO BE WORSHIPED.
THE LAST SEVENTEEN BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT WERE WRITTEN BY HEBREW PROPHETS. THESE BOOKS TELL ABOUT GOD S DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE ANCIENT HEBREWS AND HIS PROMISE TO BRING THEM BACK TO FRIENDSHIP WITH HIM. THE PROPHETS ALSO FORETELL A GREAT SURPRISE GOD WAS PLANNING FOR THE WORLD HE WAS GOING TO SEND HIS VERY OWN SON THE MESSIAH THE ANOINTED ONE THE SAVIOUR TO SAVE US FROM OUR SINS.
YOU CAN READ ABOUT THIS MESSIAH IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT TANAKH WAS MOSTLY WRITTEN IN HEBREW A FEW PARTS WERE WRITTEN IN ARAMAIC. THIS PART OF THE BIBLE IS CONSIDERED TO BE HOLY BY JEWS AS WELL AS CHRISTIANS.
THERE ARE ALSO A FEW BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT S TIME CALLED DEUTEROCANONICAL BY THOSE CHURCHES THAT ACCEPT THEM AS PART OF THE BIBLE AND APOCRYPHA BY THOSE THAT DO NOT.
THE SECOND PART IS CALLED THE NEW TESTAMENT. THE MAIN PART OF THIS BOOK IS THE STORY OF THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. THE FOUR DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS STORY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT ARE CALLED THE GOSPELS. AFTER THE GOSPELS THERE IS ALSO THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHURCH AFTER JESUS S DEATH. PART OF THIS IS TOLD THROUGH LETTERS BY EARLY CHRISTIAN LEADERS ESPECIALLY SAINT PAUL. ONE OF THE MOST QUOTED VERSES IN THE BIBLE IS FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONE AND ONLY SON THAT WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH DIE BUT HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. 
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT THE BIBLE. CHRISTIANS BELIEVE IT IS GOD S WORD TO PEOPLE. THE JEWS BELIEVE THAT ONLY THE OLD TESTAMENT IS FROM GOD. PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLICS BELIEVE THAT THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS ARE GOD S WORD. CATHOLICS ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BOOKS CALLED APOCRYPHA OR DEUTEROCANONICAL ARE PART OF THE BIBLE. SOMETIMES DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS DISAGREE OVER EXACTLY WHAT THE BIBLE MEANS.
ACCORDING TO ISLAM THE INJIL ITSELF IS TO BE FOLLOWED BUT IT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED WITH TIME. THE QUR AN IS BELIEVED TO BE THE SUCCESSOR.
ATHEISTS DO NOT BELIEVE THAT GODS EXIST SO THE BIBLE IS ONLY AN ANCIENT BOOK.
DEISTS BELIEVE IN GOD BUT THEY BELIEVE THAT THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN BY PEOPLE SO THEY DON T SEE IT AS IMPORTANT.
BICYCLE
A BICYCLE OR BIKE IS A SMALL HUMAN POWERED LAND VEHICLE WITH A SEAT TWO WHEELS TWO PEDALS AND A METAL CHAIN CONNECTED TO COGS ON THE PEDALS AND REAR WHEEL. A FRAME GIVES THE BIKE STRENGTH AND THE OTHER PARTS ARE ATTACHED TO THE FRAME. THE NAME COMES FROM THESE TWO WHEELS THE PREFIX BI MEANING TWO AND THE SUFFIX CYCLE MEANING WHEEL. IT IS POWERED BY A PERSON RIDING ON TOP WHO PUSHES THE PEDALS AROUND WITH HIS OR HER FEET.
RIDING BICYCLES WHICH IS ALSO CALLED CYCLING IS AN IMPORTANT WAY TO TRAVEL IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE WORLD. THE MOST POPULAR TYPE OF CYCLING IS UTILITY CYCLING. IT IS ALSO A COMMON RECREATION A GOOD FORM OF LOW IMPACT EXERCISE AND A POPULAR SPORT. ROAD BICYCLE RACING IS THE SECOND MOST POPULAR SPECTATOR SPORT IN THE WORLD.
BICYCLING USES LESS ENERGY PER MILE THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN TRANSPORT.
IN 1817 A GERMAN PROFESSOR BARON KARL VON DRAIS CREATED THE FIRST TWO WHEELED BICYCLE. IT WAS MADE OF WOOD AND HAD TWO WHEELS. THE FRONT WHEEL COULD BE TURNED USING THE HANDLEBARS IN ORDER TO STEER THE BIKE. HOWEVER IT DID NOT HAVE PEDALS SO THE RIDER WOULD HAVE TO PUSH THEIR FEET ON THE GROUND TO MAKE IT MOVE.
IN THE 1860S FRENCH INVENTORS ADDED PEDALS TO THE FRONT WHEEL. HOWEVER IT TOOK A LOT OF EFFORT TO TURN THE PEDALS. LATER INVENTORS MADE BIKES OUT OF METAL ONLY AND MADE THE FRONT WHEEL VERY BIG GIVING HIGHER SPEED. THIS DESIGN WAS CALLED THE PENNY FARTHING BICYCLE. HOWEVER IT WAS DIFFICULT TO RIDE SINCE IT COULD FALL EASILY AND THE RIDER WOULD FALL FAR.
SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS WERE MADE IN THE 1880S AND 90S. IN 1885 THE SAFETY BICYCLE WAS INVENTED. THIS HAD TWO WHEELS THE SAME SIZE SO THAT THE RIDER COULD SIT AT A LOWER HEIGHT. IT WAS CALLED THE SAFETY BICYCLE BECAUSE IT MUCH EASIER TO RIDE THAN THE PENNY FARTHING. WHEN STOPPING THE RIDER CAN SIMPLY PUT DOWN A FOOT INSTEAD OF COMPLETELY DISMOUNTING. INSTEAD OF PEDALING AND STEERING WITH THE FRONT WHEEL THE SAFETY BICYCLE STEERS WITH THE FRONT WHEEL WHILE THE PEDALS TURN THE BACK WHEEL USING A CHAIN. BRAKES OPERATED BY HAND LEVERS ON SOME BIKES ALSO INCREASED SAFETY.
IN 1888 SCOTTISH INVENTOR JOHN BOYD DUNLOP RE INVENTED A TYPE OF TIRE WHICH WAS FILLED WITH AIR AND THIS MADE CYCLING FAR MORE COMFORTABLE. SOON THE FREEWHEEL WAS INVENTED. THIS WAS A DEVICE INSIDE THE HUB OF THE BACK WHEEL THAT ALLOWED THE WHEEL TO SPIN EVEN IF THE RIDER WASN T PEDALLING. HOWEVER THIS MEANT THE RIDER COULD NO LONGER STOP THE BIKE BY BACKPEDALLING. AS A RESULT A DIFFERENT TYPE OF BRAKE WAS INVENTED WHICH COULD STOP THE BIKE IF THE PEDALS WERE TURNED BACKWARDS. LATER INVENTIONS INCLUDED BETTER BRAKES AND GEARS WHICH MADE CYCLING OVER HILLS MUCH EASIER. DURING THIS TIME THE BICYCLE BECAME VERY POPULAR.
BASIC COMPONENTS COMMON TO MOST BIKES INCLUDE A SEAT PEDALS GEARING HANDLEBAR WHEELS AND BRAKES ALL MOUNTED ON A FRAME. THE MAJORITY ALSO HAVE A GEAR SHIFTER. THE CYCLIST S FEET PUSH THE PEDALS TO MAKE THEM GO AROUND IN CIRCLES WHICH MOVES THE CHAIN WHICH TURNS THE BACK WHEEL OF THE BIKE TO MAKE THE BIKE MOVE FORWARDS. THE FRONT WHEEL IS CONNECTED TO THE HANDLEBAR SO TURNING THE HANDLEBAR FROM SIDE TO SIDE SWIVELS THE FRONT WHEEL WHICH STEERS THE BIKE.
WHEN RIDING ON STREETS IT IS SAFEST TO RIDE ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE STREET THAT CARS DRIVE WHICH WOULD MEAN RIDING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD IN COUNTRIES WHERE PEOPLE DRIVE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD AND RIDING ON THE LEFT IN COUNTRIES WHERE PEOPLE DRIVE ON THE LEFT. TO AVOID HITTING PEOPLE RIDERS MUST OBEY SIGNS THAT SAY NO BICYCLING EVEN IF IT DOES NOT SEEM TO MAKE SENSE AT THE TIME. LOW LIGHT MAKES BICYCLE LIGHTING IMPORTANT. IT MAY NOT BE SAFE TO RIDE WHEN IT IS DARK. RIDERS WEAR REFLECTIVE CLOTHING TO BE SAFER IN LOW LIGHT. WEARING A HELMET MAKES BICYCLE RIDING SAFER. MORE THAN 300 000 PEOPLE CHILDREN ALONE TO GO TO A HOSPITAL EVERY YEAR BECAUSE THEY WERE HURT RIDING A BICYCLE. WEARING A HELMET DOES NOT MEAN THAT SOMEBODY CANNOT BE HURT IF THEY CRASH THEIR BICYCLE BUT IT MAKES BEING HURT LESS LIKELY. SOME BICYCLES HAVE BELLS OR HORNS THAT THE RIDER CAN USE TO WARN OTHER PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE RIDING BY THEM.
A SAFE WAY TO GO ON A BICYCLE IS WHEN YOU HAVE A BICYCLE PATH LINKING HOUSES WITH SHOPS SCHOOLS AND STATIONS. THESE ARE MADE IN PLACES WHERE BICYCLE SAFETY IS GIVEN CONSIDERATION SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CYCLE IN BUSY TRAFFIC ON DANGEROUS ROADS.
BIRD
BIRDS AVES ARE A GROUP OF VERTEBRATES WHICH EVOLVED FROM DINOSAURS. THEY ARE ENDOTHERMIC WITH FEATHERS.
MODERN BIRDS ARE TOOTHLESS THEY HAVE BEAKED JAWS. THEY LAY HARD SHELLED EGGS. THEY HAVE A HIGH METABOLIC RATE A FOUR CHAMBERED HEART AND A STRONG YET LIGHTWEIGHT SKELETON. 
BIRDS LIVE ALL OVER THE WORLD. THEY RANGE IN SIZE FROM THE 5 CM 2 IN BEE HUMMINGBIRD TO THE 2.70M 9 FT OSTRICH. THEY ARE THE CLASS OF TETRAPODS WITH THE MOST LIVING SPECIES ABOUT TEN THOUSAND. MORE THAN HALF OF THESE ARE PASSERINES SOMETIMES KNOWN AS PERCHING BIRDS. 
BIRDS ARE THE CLOSEST LIVING RELATIVES OF THE CROCODILIA. THE FOSSIL RECORD SHOWS THAT BIRDS EVOLVED FROM FEATHERED THEROPOD DINOSAURS. MODERN BIRDS ARE NOT DESCENDED FROM ARCHAEOPTERYX. THEY FIRST APPEARED DURING THE CRETACEOUS ABOUT 100 MILLION YEARS AGO. 
BIRDS DIVERSIFIED DRAMATICALLY ROUND ABOUT THE TIME OF THE CRETACEOUS PALAEOGENE EXTINCTION EVENT 66 MILLION YEARS AGO WHICH KILLED OFF ALL THE NON AVIAN DINOSAUR LINES. BIRDS ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE SOUTHERN CONTINENTS SURVIVED THIS EVENT AND THEN MIGRATED TO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. 
PRIMITIVE BIRD LIKE DINOSAURS ARE IN THE BROADER GROUP AVIALAE. THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND BACK TO THE MID JURASSIC PERIOD AROUND 170 MILLION YEARS AGO. MANY OF THESE EARLY STEM BIRDS SUCH AS ARCHAEOPTERYX WERE NOT YET CAPABLE OF FULLY POWERED FLIGHT. MANY HAD PRIMITIVE CHARACTERISTICS LIKE TEETH IN THEIR JAWS AND LONG BONY TAILS.
BIRDS HAVE WINGS WHICH ARE MORE OR LESS DEVELOPED DEPENDING ON THE SPECIES. THE ONLY KNOWN GROUPS WITHOUT WINGS ARE THE EXTINCT MOA AND ELEPHANT BIRDS. WINGS WHICH EVOLVED FROM FORELIMBS GAVE BIRDS THE ABILITY TO FLY. LATER MANY GROUPS EVOLVED WITH REDUCED WINGS SUCH AS RATITES PENGUINS AND MANY ISLAND SPECIES OF BIRDS. THE DIGESTIVE AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEMS OF BIRDS ARE ALSO ADAPTED FOR FLIGHT. SOME BIRD SPECIES IN AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS PARTICULARLY SEABIRDS AND SOME WATERBIRDS HAVE EVOLVED AS GOOD SWIMMERS.
SOME BIRDS ESPECIALLY CROWS AND PARROTS ARE AMONG THE MOST INTELLIGENT ANIMALS. SEVERAL BIRD SPECIES MAKE AND USE TOOLS. MANY SOCIAL SPECIES PASS ON KNOWLEDGE ACROSS GENERATIONS A FORM OF CULTURE. MANY SPECIES ANNUALLY MIGRATE GREAT DISTANCES. BIRDS ARE SOCIAL. THEY COMMUNICATE WITH VISUAL SIGNALS CALLS AND BIRD SONGS. THEY HAVE SOCIAL BEHAVIOURS SUCH AS COOPERATIVE BREEDING AND HUNTING FLOCKING AND MOBBING OF PREDATORS. 
MOST BIRD SPECIES ARE SOCIALLY MONOGAMOUS USUALLY FOR ONE BREEDING SEASON AT A TIME SOMETIMES FOR YEARS BUT RARELY FOR LIFE. OTHER SPECIES ARE POLYGYNOUS ONE MALE WITH MANY FEMALES OR RARELY POLYANDROUS ONE FEMALE WITH MANY MALES. BIRDS PRODUCE OFFSPRING BY LAYING EGGS WHICH ARE FERTILISED BY SEXUAL REPRODUCTION. THEY ARE OFTEN LAID IN A NEST AND INCUBATED BY THE PARENTS. MOST BIRDS HAVE AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF PARENTAL CARE AFTER HATCHING. SOME BIRDS SUCH AS HENS LAY EGGS EVEN WHEN NOT FERTILISED THOUGH UNFERTILISED EGGS DO NOT PRODUCE OFFSPRING.
MANY SPECIES OF BIRDS ARE EATEN BY HUMANS. DOMESTICATED AND UNDOMESTICATED BIRDS POULTRY AND GAME ARE SOURCES OF EGGS MEAT AND FEATHERS. SONGBIRDS PARROTS AND OTHER SPECIES ARE POPULAR AS PETS. GUANO IS HARVESTED FOR USE AS A FERTILISER. BIRDS FIGURE THROUGHOUT HUMAN CULTURE. ABOUT 120 130 SPECIES HAVE BECOME EXTINCT DUE TO HUMAN ACTIVITY SINCE THE 17TH CENTURY AND HUNDREDS MORE BEFORE THEN. HUMAN ACTIVITY THREATENS ABOUT 1 200 BIRD SPECIES WITH EXTINCTION THOUGH EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO PROTECT THEM. RECREATIONAL BIRDWATCHING IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE ECOTOURISM INDUSTRY.
BIRDS COME IN A HUGE RANGE OF COLOURS. THESE COLOURS CAN BE USEFUL TO A BIRD IN TWO WAYS. CAMOUFLAGE COLOURS HELP TO HIDE THE BIRD AND BRIGHT COLOURS IDENTIFY THE BIRD TO OTHERS OF THE SAME SPECIES. OFTEN THE MALE IS BRIGHTLY COLOURED WHILE THE FEMALE IS CAMOUFLAGED.
MANY BIRDS ARE BROWN GREEN OR GREY. THESE COLOURS MAKE A BIRD HARDER TO SEE THEY CAMOUFLAGE THE BIRD. BROWN IS THE MOST COMMON COLOUR. BROWN BIRDS INCLUDE SPARROWS EMUS THRUSHES LARKS EAGLES FALCONS AND THE FEMALE BIRDS OF MANY SPECIES SUCH AS WRENS DUCKS BLACKBIRDS AND PEACOCKS. WHEN A BROWN BIRD IS IN LONG GRASS OR AMONG TREE TRUNKS OR ROCKS IT IS CAMOUFLAGED. BIRDS THAT LIVE IN LONG GRASS OFTEN HAVE BROWN FEATHERS STREAKED WITH BLACK WHICH LOOKS LIKE SHADOWS. A BITTERN IS ALMOST INVISIBLE IN LONG REEDS. OTHER BIRDS INCLUDING STARLINGS AND MINAHS ARE QUITE DARK IN COLOUR BUT ARE FLECKED WITH LITTLE SPOTS THAT LOOK LIKE RAINDROPS ON LEAVES.
MANY BIRDS FROM HOT COUNTRIES ARE GREEN OR HAVE SOME GREEN FEATHERS PARTICULARLY PARROTS. BIRDS THAT LIVE IN GREEN TREES OFTEN HAVE GREEN BACKS EVEN IF THEY HAVE BRIGHT COLOURED BREASTS. FROM THE BACK THE BIRDS ARE CAMOUFLAGED. THIS IS VERY USEFUL WHEN SITTING ON A NEST. THE BIRD S BRIGHT COLOURED BREAST IS HIDDEN. BUDGERIGARS ARE BRED IN DIFFERENT COLOURS SUCH AS BLUE WHITE AND MAUVE BUT IN THE WILD THEY ARE NEARLY ALL GREEN AND YELLOW. EVEN THOUGH THEY FLY VERY WELL THEY NORMALLY SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THE GROUND EATING GRASS SEEDS. THEIR YELLOW AND BLACK STRIPED BACK HELPS TO HIDE THEM IN THE SHADOWS MADE BY LONG DRY GRASS WHILE THEIR GREEN BREASTS ARE A SIMILAR COLOUR TO THE LEAVES OF GUM TREES.
GREY BIRDS INCLUDE MOST PIGEONS AND DOVES CRANES STORKS AND HERONS. GREY BIRDS ARE OFTEN ROCK LIVING BIRDS LIKE PIGEONS OR BIRDS THAT SIT ON DEAD TREE TRUNKS LOOKING LIKE A BROKEN BRANCH. WATER BIRDS LIKE HERONS OFTEN HAVE A PALE GREY COLOUR WHICH MAKES IT HARDER FOR A FISH TO NOTICE THAT THE BIRD IS STANDING LOOKING DOWN FOR SOMETHING TO CATCH. WATER BIRDS NO MATTER WHAT COLOUR THEY ARE ON TOP ARE OFTEN WHITE UNDERNEATH SO THAT WHEN A FISH LOOKS UP THE BIRD LOOKS LIKE PART OF THE SKY.
BLACK BIRDS INCLUDE CROWS RAVENS AND MALE BLACKBIRDS. SOME BIRDS THAT ARE DARK COLOURS SPEND QUITE A LOT OF TIME ON THE GROUND HOPPING AROUND IN THE SHADOWS UNDER BUSHES. AMONG THESE BIRDS ARE THE MALE BLACKBIRD AND THE SATIN BOWERBIRD WHICH IS NOT BLACK BUT VERY DARK BLUE. CROWS AND RAVENS OFTEN PERCH HIGH ON BARE TREES IN THE WINTER WHERE THEIR BLACK SHAPE AGAINST THE SKY LOOKS LIKE THE DARK BARE BRANCHES.
MANY BIRDS ARE NOT CAMOUFLAGED BUT STAND OUT WITH VIVID COLOURS. THEY ARE USUALLY MALE BIRDS WHOSE FEMALES ARE DULL AND CAMOUFLAGED. THE FUNCTION OF THE COLOURS IS TWO FOLD. FIRST THE COLOURS HELP THEM GET MATES AND SECOND THE COLOURS IDENTIFY THEM TO OTHER MALES OF THE SAME SPECIES. MANY BIRDS ARE TERRITORIAL ESPECIALLY IN THE NESTING SEASON. THEY GIVE OUT TERRITORY SOUNDS AND ARE EASILY SEEN. THIS LETS OTHER MALES KNOW THEY WILL DEFEND THEIR TERRITORY. IT SENDS OUT A LOOK ELSEWHERE SIGNAL TO THEIR COMPETITORS.
SOME BIRDS ARE FAMOUS FOR THEIR COLOUR AND ARE NAMED FOR IT SUCH AS THE BLUEBIRD THE AZURE KINGFISHER THE GOLDEN PHEASANT THE SCARLET MACAW THE VIOLET WREN AND THE ROBIN.
MANY OTHER BIRDS ARE VERY BRIGHTLY COLOURED IN COUNTLESS COMBINATIONS. SOME OF THE MOST COLOURFUL BIRDS ARE QUITE COMMON LIKE PHEASANTS PEACOCKS DOMESTIC FOWL AND PARROTS. COLOURFUL SMALL BIRDS INCLUDE BLUE TITS THE GOLD FINCHES HUMMING BIRDS FAIRY WRENS AND BEE EATERS WHICH ARE ALSO CALLED RAINBOW BIRDS. SOME BIRDS LIKE THOSE OF THE BIRD OF PARADISE IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA HAVE SUCH BEAUTIFUL FEATHERS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HUNTED FOR THEM.
THE PEAFOWL IS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF A DISPLAY OF COLOUR TO ATTRACT A MATE. ALSO THE MALE DOMESTIC FOWL AND JUNGLEFOWL HAVE LONG SHINY FEATHERS ABOVE HIS TAIL AND ALSO LONG NECK FEATHERS THAT MAY BE A DIFFERENT COLOUR TO HIS WINGS AND BODY. THERE ARE ONLY A VERY FEW TYPES OF BIRDS LIKE THE ECLECTUS PARROT WHERE THE FEMALE IS MORE COLOURFUL THAN THE MALE.
PIED BIRDS ARE BLACK AND WHITE. BLACK AND WHITE BIRDS INCLUDE MAGPIES PIED GEESE PELICANS AND AUSTRALIAN MAGPIES WHICH ARE NOT REALLY MAGPIES AT ALL. PIED BIRDS OFTEN HAVE BRIGHTLY COLOURED BEAKS AND LEGS OF YELLOW OR RED. THE SILVER PHEASANT WITH ITS LONG WHITE TAIL STRIPED WITH FINE BARS OF BLACK HAS A BRIGHTLY COLOURED FACE.
MOST BIRDS CAN FLY. THEY DO THIS BY PUSHING THROUGH THE AIR WITH THEIR WINGS. THE CURVED SURFACES OF THE WINGS CAUSE AIR CURRENTS WIND WHICH LIFT THE BIRD. FLAPPING KEEPS THE AIR CURRENT MOVING TO CREATE LIFT AND ALSO MOVES THE BIRD FORWARD.
SOME BIRDS CAN GLIDE ON AIR CURRENTS WITHOUT FLAPPING. MANY BIRDS USE THIS METHOD WHEN THEY ARE ABOUT TO LAND. SOME BIRDS CAN ALSO HOVER AND REMAIN IN ONE PLACE. THIS METHOD IS USED BY BIRDS OF PREY SUCH AS FALCONS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO EAT. SEAGULLS ARE ALSO GOOD AT HOVERING PARTICULARLY IF THERE IS A STRONG BREEZE. THE MOST EXPERT HOVERING BIRDS ARE TINY HUMMINGBIRDS WHICH CAN BEAT THEIR WINGS BOTH BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AND CAN STAY QUITE STILL IN THE AIR WHILE THEY DIP THEIR LONG BEAKS INTO FLOWERS TO FEED ON THE SWEET NECTAR. 
DIFFERENT TYPES OF BIRDS HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS. THEIR WINGS ARE ADAPTED TO SUIT THE WAY THEY FLY.
LARGE BIRDS OF PREY SUCH AS EAGLES THAT SPEND A LOT OF TIME SOARING ON THE WIND HAVE WINGS THAT ARE LARGE AND BROAD. THE MAIN FLIGHT FEATHERS ARE LONG AND WIDE. THEY HELP THE EAGLE TO STAY ON RISING AIR CURRENTS WITHOUT USING MUCH ENERGY WHILE THE EAGLE LOOKS AT THE GROUND BELOW TO FIND THE NEXT MEAL. WHEN THE EAGLE SEES SOME SMALL CREATURE MOVE IT CAN CLOSE ITS WINGS AND FALL FROM THE SKY LIKE A MISSILE OPENING ITS GREAT WINGS AGAIN TO SLOW DOWN AS IT COMES TO LAND. THE WORLD S LARGEST EAGLE THE PHILIPPINE EAGLE HAS A WINGSPAN OF ABOUT 2 METRES 6.7 FT WIDE.
BIRDS THAT LIVE IN GRASSLAND AREAS OR OPEN FORESTS AND FEED ON FRUIT INSECTS AND REPTILES OFTEN SPEND A LOT OF TIME FLYING SHORT JOURNEYS LOOKING FOR FOOD AND WATER. THEY HAVE WINGS THAT ARE SHAPED IN A SIMILAR WAY TO EAGLES BUT ROUNDER AND NOT AS GOOD FOR SOARING. THESE INCLUDE MANY AUSTRALIAN BIRDS LIKE COCKATOOS.
BIRDS SUCH AS GEESE THAT MIGRATE FROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER FLY VERY LONG DISTANCES. THEIR WINGS ARE BIG AND STRONG BECAUSE THE BIRDS ARE LARGE AND THEY STOCK UP ON FOOD FOR THE LONG FLIGHT. MIGRATING WATER BIRDS USUALLY FORM FAMILY GROUPS OF 12 30 BIRDS. THEY FLY VERY HIGH MAKING USE OF LONG STREAMS OF AIR THAT BLOW FROM NORTH TO SOUTH IN DIFFERENT SEASONS. THEY ARE VERY WELL ORGANISED OFTEN FLYING IN A V PATTERN. THE GEESE AT THE BACK DO NOT HAVE TO FLAP SO HARD THEY ARE PULLED ON BY THE WIND OF THE ONES AT THE FRONT. EVERY SO OFTEN THEY CHANGE THE LEADER SO THAT THE FRONT BIRD WHO DOES MOST WORK AND SETS THE PACE CAN HAVE A REST. GEESE AND SWANS ARE THE HIGHEST FLYING BIRDS REACHING 8 000 METRES OR MORE WHEN ON MIGRATION. GEESE OFTEN HONK LOUDLY WHILE THEY ARE FLYING. IT IS THOUGHT THAT THEY DO THIS TO SUPPORT THE LEADER AND HELP THE YOUNG ONES.
BIRDS THAT FLY VERY QUICKLY SUCH AS SWIFTS AND SWALLOWS HAVE LONG NARROW POINTED WINGS. THESE BIRDS NEED GREAT SPEED BECAUSE THEY EAT INSECTS CATCHING MOST OF THEM WHILE THEY ARE FLYING. THESE BIRDS ALSO MIGRATE. THEY OFTEN COLLECT IN HUGE FLOCKS OF THOUSANDS OF BIRDS THAT MOVE TOGETHER LIKE A WHIRLING CLOUD.
BIRDS THAT LIVE IN BUSHES AND BRANCHES HAVE TRIANGULAR WINGS THAT HELP THE BIRD CHANGE DIRECTION. MANY FOREST BIRDS ARE EXPERT AT GETTING UP SPEED BY FLAPPING AND THEN GLIDING STEADILY AMONG THE TREES TILTING TO AVOID THINGS AS THEY GO. MEMBERS OF THE KINGFISHER FAMILY ARE EXPERT AT THIS TYPE OF FLYING.
BIRDS SUCH AS OWLS THAT HUNT AT NIGHT HAVE WINGS WITH SOFT ROUNDED FEATHERS SO THAT THEY DO NOT FLAP LOUDLY. BIRDS THAT ARE AWAKE AT NIGHT ARE CALLED NOCTURNAL BIRDS. BIRDS THAT ARE AWAKE DURING THE DAY ARE DIURNAL.
A WANDERING ALBATROSS AND ARCTIC TERN MIGHT SPEND SEVERAL YEARS WITHOUT COMING TO LAND. THEY CAN SLEEP WHILE GLIDING AND HAVE WINGS WHICH WHEN THEY ARE STRETCHED RIGHT OUT LOOK LIKE THE WINGS OF A JET PLANE.
BIRD LIKE CHICKENS THAT FEED MAINLY ON THE GROUND AND ONLY USE THEIR WINGS TO FLY TO SAFETY HAVE SMALL WINGS.
FLOCKS OF BIRDS CAN BE VERY HIGHLY ORGANISED IN A WAY THAT TAKES CARE OF ALL THE FLOCK MEMBERS. STUDIES OF SMALL FLOCKING BIRDS LIKE TREE SPARROWS SHOW THAT THEY CLEARLY COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER AS SOMETIMES THOUSANDS OF BIRDS MAY FLY IN CLOSE FORMATION AND SPIRAL PATTERNS WITHOUT COLLIDING OR FLYING INTO EACH OTHER.
TWO COMMON BEHAVIOURS IN FLOCKING BIRDS ARE GUARDING AND RECONNAISSANCE. WHEN A FLOCK OF BIRDS IS FEEDING IT IS COMMON FOR ONE BIRD TO PERCH ON A HIGH PLACE TO KEEP GUARD OVER THE FLOCK. IN THE SAME WAY WHEN A FLOCK IS ASLEEP OFTEN ONE BIRD WILL REMAIN AWAKE. 
IT IS ALSO COMMON FOR LARGE FLOCKS TO SEND ONE OR TWO BIRDS AHEAD OF THEM WHEN THEY ARE FLYING TO A NEW AREA. THE LOOK OUT BIRDS CAN SPY THE LIE OF THE LAND TO FIND FOOD WATER AND GOOD PLACES TO PERCH.
SOME BIRDS DO NOT FLY. THESE INCLUDE RUNNING BIRDS LIKE OSTRICHES AND EMUS AND OCEAN LIVING BIRDS THE LARGE PENGUIN FAMILY.
OSTRICHES AND EMUS DO NOT NEED TO FLY BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THEY FEED AND NEST ON THE GROUND THEIR GREAT SIZE AND THEIR SPEED IS THEIR PROTECTION. SOME OTHER GROUND FEEDING BIRDS HAVE NOT BEEN SO LUCKY. SOME BIRDS SUCH AS THE DODO AND THE KIWI WERE GROUND FEEDING BIRDS THAT LIVED IN SAFETY ON ISLANDS WHERE THERE WAS NOTHING DANGEROUS TO EAT THEM. THEY LOST THE POWER OF FLIGHT. KIWIS ARE ENDANGERED BECAUSE EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT TO NEW ZEALAND BROUGHT ANIMALS LIKE CATS DOGS AND RATS WHICH KILL KIWIS AND EAT THEIR EGGS. HOWEVER KIWIS AND ALSO THE RARE NEW ZEALAND GROUND PARROT HAVE SURVIVED. IN THE CASE OF DODOS THEY WERE FAT AND DELICIOUS. THEY WERE KILLED AND EATEN BY SAILORS UNTIL THERE WAS NONE LEFT. OTHER FLIGHTLESS BIRDS WHICH HAVE DISAPPEARED ARE THE GREAT AUK AND THE MOA.
PENGUINS SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AT SEA WHERE THEY ARE IN DANGER FROM SEALS. ON LAND THEY USUALLY LIVE IN AREAS WHERE THERE WERE FEW DANGERS UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF EUROPEAN SETTLERS WITH DOGS AND CATS. THEIR WINGS HAVE ADAPTED TO LIFE IN THE SEA AND HAVE BECOME FLIPPERS WHICH HELP THEM IN SWIMMING VERY FAST.
ALTHOUGH BIRDS ARE WARM BLOODED CREATURES LIKE MAMMALS THEY DO NOT GIVE BIRTH TO LIVE BABIES. THEY LAY EGGS LIKE LIZARDS DO. UNLIKE MOST REPTILES THE SHELL OF A BIRD S EGG IS HARD. THE BABY BIRD GROWS INSIDE THE EGG AND AFTER A FEW WEEKS BREAKS OUT OR HATCHES.
BIRDS IN COLD CLIMATES USUALLY HAVE A BREEDING SEASON ONCE A YEAR IN THE SPRING. MIGRATORY BIRDS CAN HAVE TWO SPRINGS AND TWO MATING SEASONS IN A YEAR. SO CAN BIRDS THAT LIVE IN HOT CLIMATES.
WHEN THE BREEDING SEASON ARRIVES THE BIRDS CHOOSE PARTNERS. SOME BIRDS ARE MATED FOR LIFE LIKE MARRIED COUPLES. THESE BIRDS INCLUDE PIGEONS GEESE AND CRANES. OTHER BIRDS LOOK FOR NEW PARTNERS EACH YEAR AND SOMETIMES A MALE BIRD OR COCK WILL HAVE SEVERAL WIVES.
FOR BIRDS THAT CHOOSE NEW MATES PART OF THE BREEDING SEASON IS DISPLAY. THE MALE BIRD WILL DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO ATTRACT FEMALES. THESE INCLUDE SINGING DANCING SHOWING OFF THE FEATHERS AND BUILDING A BEAUTIFUL NEST. SOME MALE BIRDS HAVE SPLENDID FEATHERS FOR ATTRACTING FEMALES. THE MOST FAMOUS IS THE PEACOCK WHO CAN SPREAD THE FEATHERS ABOVE HIS TAIL INTO A HUGE FAN. 
ONCE THE BIRDS HAVE FOUND PARTNERS THEY FIND A SUITABLE PLACE TO LAY EGGS. THE IDEA OF WHAT IS A SUITABLE PLACE DIFFERS BETWEEN SPECIES BUT MOST BUILD BIRD NESTS. ROBINS WILL MAKE A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE ROUND NEST OF WOVEN GRASS AND CAREFULLY LINE IT WITH FEATHERS BITS OF FLUFF AND OTHER SOFT THINGS. SWALLOWS LIKE TO NEST NEAR OTHER SWALLOWS. THEY MAKE NESTS FROM LITTLE BLOBS OF CLAY OFTEN ON A BEAM NEAR THE ROOF OF A BUILDING WHERE IT IS WELL SHELTERED. MANY BIRDS LIKE A HOLLOW TREE TO NEST IN. EAGLE S NESTS ARE OFTEN JUST PILES OF DEAD WOOD ON THE TOP OF THE TALLEST TREE OR MOUNTAIN. SCRUB TURKEYS SCRATCH TOGETHER A HUGE PILE OF LEAVES THAT MAY BE 10 METRES ACROSS. GUILLEMOTS LAY THEIR EGGS ON ROCK SHELVES WITH NO NEST AT ALL. THEIR EGGS ARE SHAPED SO THAT THEY ROLL AROUND IN CIRCLES AND DO NOT FALL OFF CLIFFS. A CUCKOO DOES NOT MAKE ITS OWN NEST. IT LAYS ITS EGG IN THE NEST OF ANOTHER BIRD AND LEAVES IT FOR THEM TO CARE FOR. THE CUCKOO EGGS ARE CAMOUFLAGED TO LOOK LIKE THE HOST S EGGS.
WHEN THE NEST HAS BEEN PREPARED THE BIRDS MATE SO THAT THE EGGS ARE FERTILISED AND THE CHICKS WILL START GROWING. UNLIKE MAMMALS BIRDS ONLY HAVE ONE OPENING AS THE EXIT HOLE FOR BODY FLUIDS AND FOR REPRODUCTION. THE OPENING IS CALLED THE CLOACA. A FEMALE BIRD CALLED A HEN HAS TWO OVARIES OF WHICH THE LEFT ONE USUALLY PRODUCES EGGS.
MOST MALE BIRDS HAVE NO SEX ORGANS THAT CAN BE SEEN. BUT INSIDE THE MALE ARE TWO TESTES WHICH PRODUCE SPERM WHICH IS STORED IN THE CLOACA. BIRDS MATE BY RUBBING THEIR CLOACAS TOGETHER ALTHOUGH WITH SOME BIRDS PARTICULARLY LARGE WATER BIRDS THE MALE HAS A SORT OF A PENIS INSIDE THE CLOACA.
ONCE THE HEN HAS MATED SHE PRODUCES FERTILE EGGS WHICH HAVE CHICKS GROWING INSIDE THEM. SHE LAYS THE EGGS IN THE NEST. THERE MIGHT BE JUST ONE EGG OR A NUMBER OF THEM CALLED A CLUTCH. EMUS MIGHT LAY AS MANY AS FIFTEEN HUGE DARK GREEN EGGS IN A CLUTCH. AFTER THE EGGS ARE LAID THEY ARE INCUBATED OR KEPT WARM SO THE CHICKS FORM INSIDE. MOST BIRDS STAY TOGETHER FOR THE WHOLE NESTING SEASON AND ONE ADVANTAGE IS THAT THE WORK IS SHARED. MANY BIRDS TAKE TURNS SITTING ON THE EGGS SO THAT EACH ADULT CAN FEED.
THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE. WITH EMUS THE MALE DOES ALL THE SITTING AND ALL THE BABY MINDING. WITH EMPEROR PENGUINS IT IS ALSO THE MALE THAT CARES FOR THE EGG. THERE IS ONLY ONE EGG WHICH HE KEEPS ON HIS FEET AND UNDER HIS FEATHERS STANDING IN A BIG GROUP OF MALES WITHOUT FEEDING UNTIL THE CHICK IS HATCHED. WHILE THE EGGS ARE HATCHING THE FEMALES ARE AT SEA FEEDING SO THAT THEY CAN CARE FOR THE CHICKS WHEN THEY RETURN.
SOME BIRDS PUT THE EGGS INSIDE OR ON TOP OF THE MOUND OF LEAVES AND TWIGS. THE MOUND ACTS LIKE A COMPOST HEAP. THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE ROTTING LEAVES CAUSES THE TEMPERATURE TO RISE. THIS IS HEAT RELEASED BY THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL RESPIRATION. IT IS THE SAME REACTION AS THAT WHICH KEEPS MAMMALS AND BIRDS AT A HIGH TEMPERATURE. THE PARENTS LEAVE THE MOUND. WHEN THE CHICKS HATCH THEY ARE ABLE TO FEED THEMSELVES.
MANY SMALL BIRDS TAKE 2 4 WEEKS TO HATCH EGGS. ALBATROSSES TAKE 80 DAYS. DURING THIS TIME THE FEMALE LOSES A LOT OF HER BODY WEIGHT.
THE QUICKEST HATCHING TIME IS FOR THE CUCKOO. SOME TYPES OF CUCKOOS TAKE ONLY 10 DAYS. THIS MEANS THAT WHEN THEY HATCH IN THE NEST OF THEIR FOSTER PARENTS THE EGGS THAT THE PARENTS HAVE LAID ARE NOT YET READY. NEWBORN CUCKOOS ARE NAKED BLIND AND UGLY BUT THEY ARE STRONG. THEY GET UNDER ANY EGGS THAT ARE IN THE NEST AND THROW THEM OUT BEFORE THEY HATCH. THAT MEANS THAT THE CUCKOO HAS THE WHOLE CARE OF BOTH PARENTS. BABY CUCKOOS GROW FAST AND OFTEN GET BIGGER THAN THE PARENTS WHO FEED THEM.
WHEN BABY BIRDS HATCH IN MOST TYPES OF BIRDS THEY ARE FED BY BOTH PARENTS AND SOMETIMES BY OLDER AUNTIES AS WELL. THEIR MOUTHS ARE OPEN ALL THE TIME AND ARE OFTEN VERY BRIGHTLY COLOURED WHICH ACTS AS A RELEASER A TRIGGER WHICH STIMULATES THE PARENT TO FEED THEM. FOR BIRDS THAT EAT GRAIN AND FRUIT THE PARENTS EAT AND PARTLY DIGEST THE FOOD FOR THE BABIES. IT IS THEN VOMITTED CAREFULLY INTO THE BABY S MOUTH.
MANY BIRDS PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT MATE FOR LIFE ARE VERY SOCIABLE AND KEEP TOGETHER IN A FAMILY GROUP WHICH MIGHT BE ANYTHING FROM 4 OR 6 ADULT BIRDS AND THEIR YOUNG TO A VERY LARGE FLOCK.
AS CHICKS GROW THEY CHANGE THE FLUFFY DOWN THAT COVERS THEM AS BABIES FOR REAL FEATHERS. AT THIS STAGE THEY ARE CALLED FLEDGLINGS. OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS MAY HELP CARE FOR FLEDGLING CHICKS FEEDING THEM AND PROTECTING THEM FROM ATTACK WHILE PARENTS ARE FEEDING. WHEN THE FLEDGLINGS HAVE THEIR NEW FEATHERS THEY COME OUT OF THE NEST TO LEARN TO FLY. IN SOME TYPES OF BIRDS LIKE PIGEONS THE PARENTS WATCH OVER THIS AND AS THE YOUNG ONES GET STRONGER WILL GIVE THEM FLYING LESSONS TEACHING THEM HOW TO GLIDE HOW TO FLY IN SPIRALS AND HOW TO LAND LIKE AN EXPERT.
MOST BIRDS ARE SOCIAL ANIMALS AT LEAST PART OF THE TIME. THEY COMMUNICATE TO EACH OTHER USING SOUNDS AND DISPLAYS.
ALMOST ALL BIRDS MAKE SOUNDS TO COMMUNICATE. THE TYPES OF NOISES THAT VARY GREATLY. SOME BIRDS CAN SING AND THEY ARE CALLED SONGBIRDS. EXAMPLES ARE ROBINS LARKS CANARIES THRUSHES NIGHTINGALES AND CROWS. BIRDS THAT ARE NOT SONGBIRDS INCLUDE PIGEONS SEAGULLS EAGLES OWLS AND DUCKS. PARROTS ARE NOT SONGBIRDS EVEN THOUGH THEY CAN BE TAUGHT TO SING HUMAN SONGS.
ALL BIRDS MAKE NOISES BIRD VOCALISATION BUT NOT ALL SING. SONGBIRDS ARE PASSERINES MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEAUTIFUL MELODIC SONGS. SONGS HAVE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS. DANGER CRIES ARE DIFFERENT FROM TERRITORIAL SONGS AND MATING CALLS ARE A THIRD TYPE. FLEDGLING MAY ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT CALLS FROM ADULTS. RECOGNITION CALLS FOR PARTNERS ARE QUITE COMMON.
AS TO WHERE THE SONG COMES FROM THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF SPECIES 
MOST SINGING BIRDS THAT ARE KEPT AS PETS LIKE CANARIES HAVE SEVERAL TUNES AND SOME VARIATIONS.
THE SAME SPECIES OF BIRD WILL SING DIFFERENT SONGS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE CURRAWONG. THIS IS AN AUSTRALIA BIRD WHICH IS LIKE A BLACK AND WHITE CROW. IN THE AUTUMN FAMILIES GET TOGETHER IN LARGE FLOCKS AND DO A LOT OF SINGING. CURRAWONGS FROM SOME AREAS SING MUCH MORE COMPLEX SONGS THAN OTHERS. GENERALLY CURRAWONGS FROM THE BLUE MOUNTAINS ARE THE FINEST SINGERS. THE SONG OF THE CURRAWONG CAN BE SUNG AS A SOLO BUT IS OFTEN PERFORMED AS A CHOIR. ONE BIRD WILL TAKE THE LEAD AND SING WARBLE WARBLE WARBLE WARBLE ALL THE OTHER BIRDS WILL JOIN IN AND SING WOOOOOOO WHEN ALL THE BIRDS KNOW THE SONG THE CHOIR WILL SING THE WARBLE PART AND THE SOLOIST WILL SING THE WOO. THE SONG CHANGES FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND FROM PLACE TO PLACE.
THE AUSTRIAN NATURALIST KONRAD LORENZ STUDIED THE WAY IN WHICH BIRDS COMMUNICATE OR TALK TO EACH OTHER. HE FOUND THAT EACH TYPE OF BIRD HAD A NUMBER OF SOUNDS WHICH THEY MADE AUTOMATICALLY WHEN EVER THEY FELT A CERTAIN WAY. EVERY SOUND HAD AN ACTION THAT WENT WITH IT. SO IF THE BIRD WAS FRIGHTENED IT ACTED FRIGHTENED AND MADE A FRIGHTENED SOUND. THIS TOLD THE OTHER BIRDS AROUND IT THAT SOMETHING FRIGHTENING WAS HAPPENING.
IF A FLOCK OF BIRDS WERE FLYING OVER A FIELD THEY WOULD BE CALLING FLY FLY BUT A HUNGRY BIRD SEEING SOMETHING GOOD TO EAT DOWN BELOW MIGHT START CALLING FOOD FOOD IF OTHER BIRDS WERE ALSO HUNGRY THEY WOULD MAKE THE SAME CALL UNTIL MORE BIRDS WERE CALLING FOOD FOOD THAN FLY FLY. AT THIS POINT THE MIND OF THE FLOCK WOULD BE CHANGED. SOME OF THE BIRDS WOULD START TO YELL FLY DOWNWARDS FLY DOWNWARDS AS THEY SANK FROM THE SKY UNTIL THE WHOLE FLOCK WAS ALL NOISILY CALLING THE SAME THING.
THESE COMMUNICATION SOUNDS ARE OFTEN SHORT HARD SOUNDS LIKE CHIRPS SQUEAKS SQUAWKS. AND TWITTERS. SOMETIMES THE CALLS ARE LONGER AND MORE MUSICAL. THEY INCLUDE THE ROOKETY COO SOUND OF A PIGEON AND THE COCKADOODLEDOO OF A ROOSTER. THE BIRD CANNOT CHANGE THESE SOUNDS. THEY ALWAYS MAKE THEM IN THE SAME WAY. THE BIRD IS LOCKED INTO MAKING EACH SOUND EVERY TIME A PARTICULAR IDEA COMES INTO ITS HEAD. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HOW THEY FEEL AND HOW THEY CALL IS INNATE THEY ARE BORN WITH IT. SOME CALLS IN SOME SPECIES ARE LEARNT. THEN IT IS THE TENDENCY TO LEARN WHICH IS INHERITED.
KONRAD LORENZ NOTICED THAT WHEN BIRDS SING THEY OFTEN USE A LOT OF THEIR REGULAR CALLS AS PART OF THE SONG. LORENZ HAD A FLOCK OF JACKDAWS WHICH WERE SCATTERED DURING WORLD WAR II. ONE DAY AN OLD BIRD RETURNED. FOR MANY MONTHS SHE SAT ON THE CHIMNEY SINGING HER SONG BUT IN THE SONG SHE KEPT MAKING THE CALL WHICH LORENZ KNEW MEANT COME HOME COME HOME ONE DAY TO THE GREAT SURPRISE OF LORENZ A MALE BIRD FLEW FROM A PASSING FLOCK AND JOINED HER ON THE CHIMNEY. LORENZ WAS SURE THAT IT WAS HER LONG LOST HUSBAND WHO HAD FOUND HIS WAY HOME AT LAST.
PALAEONTOLOGISTS HAVE FOUND SOME EXCEPTIONAL PLACES LAGERST TTEN WHERE FOSSILS OF EARLY BIRDS ARE FOUND. THE PRESERVATION IS SO GOOD THAT ON THE BEST EXAMPLES IMPRESSIONS OF THEIR FEATHERS CAN BE SEEN AND SOMETIMES EVEN THE REMAINS OF MEALS THEY HAVE EATEN. FROM THESE REMAINS WE KNOW THAT BIRDS EVOLVED FROM SMALL CARNIVOROUS DINOSAURS THEROPODS IN THE JURASSIC PERIOD. THEY RADIATED INTO A HUGE VARIETY IN THE LOWER CRETACEOUS. AT THE SAME TIME THEIR DIRECT COMPETITORS THE PTEROSAURS DWINDLED IN NUMBERS AND VARIETY AND BECAME EXTINCT AT THE END OF THE MESOZOIC.
BIRDS ARE CLASSIFIED BY TAXONOMISTS AS AVES AVIALAE. BIRDS ARE THE ONLY LIVING DESCENDANTS OF DINOSAURS STRICTLY SPEAKING THEY ARE DINOSAURS. BIRDS AND CROCODILIA ARE THE ONLY LIVING MEMBERS OF THE ONCE DOMINANT ARCHOSAUR REPTILES.
THE CLASS AVES IS NOW DEFINED AS ALL THE DESCENDANTS OF THE MOST RECENT COMMON ANCESTOR OF MODERN BIRDS AND ARCHAEOPTERYX LITHOGRAPHICA.
ARCHAEOPTERYX FROM THE UPPER JURASSIC SOME 150 145 MILLION YEARS AGO IS THE EARLIEST BIRD WHICH COULD FLY. IT IS FAMOUS BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST IMPORTANT FOSSILS FOUND AFTER CHARLES DARWIN PUBLISHED HIS IDEAS ABOUT EVOLUTION IN THE 19TH CENTURY. BY MODERN STANDARDS ARCHAEOPTERYX COULD NOT FLY VERY WELL. OTHER EARLY FOSSIL BIRDS ARE FOR EXAMPLE CONFUCIUSORNIS ANCHIORNIS HUXLEI AND OTHER PARAVES.
MANY FOSSILS OF EARLY BIRDS AND SMALL DINOSAURS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE LIAONING PROVINCE OF NORTHEAST CHINA. THE FOSSILS SHOW THAT MOST SMALL THEROPOD DINOSAURS HAD FEATHERS. THESE DEPOSITS HAVE PRESERVED THEM SO WELL THAT THE IMPRESSIONS OF THEIR FEATHERS CAN BE CLEARLY SEEN. THIS LEADS US TO THINK THAT FEATHERS EVOLVED FIRST AS HEAT INSULATION AND ONLY LATER FOR FLIGHT. THE ORIGIN OF BIRDS LIES IN THESE SMALL FEATHERED DINOSAURS.
PALAEONTOLOGISTS NOW AGREE THAT BIRDS EVOLVED FROM MANIRAPTORA GROUP OF DINOSAURS. THIS EXPLAINS WHY ONE MIGHT SAY BIRDS ARE LIVING DINOSAURS.
SOME BIRDS ARE EATEN AS FOOD. MOST USUALLY IT IS THE CHICKEN AND ITS EGGS BUT PEOPLE OFTEN ALSO EAT GEESE PHEASANTS TURKEYS AND DUCKS. OTHER BIRDS ARE SOMETIMES EATEN ARE EMUS OSTRICHES PIGEONS GROUSE QUAILS DOVES WOODCOCKS AND EVEN SONGBIRDS. SOME SPECIES HAVE DIED OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN HUNTED FOR FOOD FOR EXAMPLE THE DODO AND THE PASSENGER PIGEON.
MANY SPECIES HAVE LEARNED HOW TO GET FOOD FROM PEOPLE. THE NUMBER OF BIRDS OF THESE SPECIES HAS GROWN BECAUSE OF IT. SEAGULLS AND CROWS FIND FOOD FROM GARBAGE DUMPS. THE FERAL PIGEON COLUMBA LIVIA SPARROWS PASSER DOMESTICUS AND STARLINGS STURNUS VULGARIS LIVE IN LARGE NUMBERS IN TOWNS AND CITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD.
SOMETIMES PEOPLE ALSO USE WORKING BIRDS. FOR EXAMPLE HOMING PIGEONS CARRY MESSAGES. NOWADAYS PEOPLE SOMETIMES RACE THEM FOR SPORT. PEOPLE ALSO USE FALCONS FOR HUNTING AND CORMORANTS FOR FISHING. IN THE PAST PEOPLE IN MINES OFTEN USED A CANARY TO SEE IF THERE WERE BAD GAS METHANE IN THE AIR.
PEOPLE OFTEN HAVE COLORFUL BIRDS SUCH AS PARROTS AND MYNAHS AS PETS. THESE INTELLIGENT BIRDS ARE POPULAR BECAUSE THEY CAN COPY HUMAN TALKING. BECAUSE OF THIS SOME PEOPLE TRAP BIRDS AND TAKE THEM TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO SELL. THIS IS NOT USUALLY ALLOWED THESE DAYS. MOST PET BIRDS ARE SPECIALLY BRED AND ARE SOLD IN PET SHOPS.
PEOPLE CAN CATCH SOME BIRD DISEASES FOR EXAMPLE PSITTACOSIS SALMONELLOSIS CAMPYLOBACTERIOSIS NEWCASTLE S DISEASE MYCOBACTERIOSIS INFLUENZA GIARDIASIS AND CRYPTOSPORIADIOSIS. IN 2005 THERE WAS AN EPIDEMIC OF BIRD INFLUENZA SPREADING THROUGH SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD OFTEN CALLED AVIAN FLU.
SOME PEOPLE HAVE BIRDBOXES IN THEIR GARDENS TO GIVE BIRDS A PLACE TO NEST AND BIRD TABLES WHERE BIRDS CAN GET FOOD AND WATER IN VERY COLD OR VERY DRY WEATHER. THIS LETS PEOPLE SEE SOME SMALL BIRDS CLOSE UP WHICH ARE NORMALLY HIDDEN AWAY IN BUSHES AND TREES.
BUDDHISM
BUDDHISM IS AN INDIAN RELIGION OR DHARMA FOUND BY SIDDHARTHA GAUTAMA. BUDDHISM IS ALSO VERY SIMILAR TO HINDUISM AS IT WAS CREATED FROM IT. BUDDHISM TEACHES PEOPLE HOW TO END THEIR SUFFERING BY CUTTING OUT GREED HATRED AND IGNORANCE. BUDDHISM ALONG WITH OTHER INDIAN RELIGIONS BELIEVES IN KARMA I.E. WHEN PEOPLE DO BAD THINGS THEY WILL GET BAD CONSEQUENCES. WHEN PEOPLE DO GOOD THINGS THEY WILL GET GOOD CONSEQUENCES.
THIS CAUSE AND EFFECT CHAIN IS REFLECTED IN THE ENDLESS CYCLES OF LIFE DEATH AND REBIRTH. BUDDHISM BELIEVES IN REINCARNATION REBIRTH. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF A BUDDHIST IS TO GET ENLIGHTENMENT NIRVANA AND LIBERATE ONESELF FROM ENDLESS REINCARNATION AND SUFFERING. SOME SEE BUDDHISM AS A RELIGION OTHERS SEE IT IS A PHILOSOPHY AND OTHERS THINK IT IS A WAY OF FINDING REALITY.
BUDDHISM WAS STARTED BY SIDDH RTHA GAUTAMA OR GAUTAMA BUDDHA AFTER BECOMING ENGLIGHTENED 563483 BC IN NORTHERN INDIA. HE GAVE UP EVERYTHING TO FIND A WAY TO END SUFFERING. HIS TEACHINGS SPREAD AFTER HIS DEATH TO CENTRAL ASIA TIBET SRI LANKA SOUTHEAST ASIA AND THE EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES OF CHINA MONGOLIA KOREA AND JAPAN AND HAVE NOW SPREAD TO THE WEST.
THE BUDDHA S TEACHINGS ARE ABOUT SUFFERING AND HOW TO OVERCOME IT. ACCORDING TO THE BUDDHA OVERCOMING SUFFERING ALLOWS A PERSON TO BE TRULY HAPPY. THE BUDDHA TAUGHT THAT IF PEOPLE MAKE GOOD DECISIONS THEY WOULD BE HAPPY AND HAVE PEACE OF MIND. THE BUDDHA TAUGHT THAT LIFE IS IMPERFECT AND THAT WE WILL SUFFER. HE TAUGHT THAT WE SUFFER BECAUSE OF DESIRE ANGER AND STUPIDITY AND HE SHOWED THAT WE COULD END OUR SUFFERING BY LETTING GO OF DESIRES AND OVERCOMING ANGER AND STUPIDITY. THE COMPLETE LETTING GO OF THESE NEGATIVE INFLUENCES IS CALLED NIRVANA MEANING TO EXTINGUISH LIKE PUTTING OUT THE FLAME OF A CANDLE. THE END OF SUFFERING WHEN ONE IS FULLY AWAKE PUT AN END TO ONE S OWN IGNORANCE AND HAS LET GO OF ALL DESIRE AND ANGER IS ALSO CALLED ENLIGHTENMENT. IN BUDDHISM ENLIGHTENMENT AND NIRVANA MEAN THE SAME THING.
BUDDHISM TEACHES NON HARM AND MODERATION OR BALANCE NOT GOING TOO FAR ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. BUDDHISTS OFTEN MEDITATE WHILE SITTING IN A SPECIAL OR SPECIFIC WAY. THEY OFTEN CHANT AND MEDITATE WHILE WALKING. BUDDHISTS SOMETIMES DO THESE THINGS TO UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN HEART AND MIND. SOMETIMES THEY DO THESE THINGS TO UNDERSTAND THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS. SOMETIMES THEY DO THESE THINGS TO FIND PEACE.
BUDDHISM DOES NOT SAY IF GODS EXIST OR NOT BUT ONE CAN READ MANY STORIES ABOUT GODS IN SOME BUDDHIST BOOKS. BUDDHISTS DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD LOOK TO GODS TO SAVE THEM OR BRING THEM ENLIGHTENMENT. THE GODS MAY HAVE POWER OVER WORLD EVENTS AND THEY MIGHT HELP PEOPLE OR THEY MIGHT NOT. BUT IT S UP TO EACH PERSON TO GET TO ENLIGHTENMENT. MANY BUDDHISTS HONOR GODS IN RITUAL. OTHER BUDDHISTS BELIEVE THE STORIES ABOUT GODS ARE JUST THERE TO HELP US LEARN ABOUT PARTS OF OURSELVES.
BUDDHA IS A SANSKRIT WORD WHICH MEANS THE ENLIGHTENED ONE OR THE AWAKENED ONE THE WORD BUDDHA OFTEN MEANS THE HISTORICAL BUDDHA NAMED BUDDHA SHAKYAMUNI SIDDHARTHA GAUTAMA 
BUDDHISTS DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A BUDDHA IS A GOD BUT THAT HE IS A HUMAN BEING WHO HAS WOKEN UP AND CAN SEE THE TRUE WAY THE WORLD WORKS. THEY BELIEVE THIS KNOWLEDGE TOTALLY CHANGES THE PERSON. SOME SAY THIS PUTS THEM BEYOND BIRTH DEATH AND REBIRTH. OTHERS THINK THIS REPRESENTS THE FINAL EXTINCTION OF DESIRE. THIS PERSON CAN HELP OTHERS BECOME ENLIGHTENED TOO.
ACCORDING TO BUDDHISM THERE WERE COUNTLESS BUDDHAS THE ONE WHO IS ENLIGHTENED BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA AND THERE WILL BE MANY BUDDHAS AFTER HIM. IN SHORT HE IS NOT THE FIRST NOR WILL HE BE THE LAST.
THE FIRST BUDDHA IN BUDDHAVAMSA SUTTA WAS TA HA KARA BUDDHA THE MAHAPADANA SUTTA SAY THE FIRST BUDDHA WAS VIPASSI BUDDHA HOWEVER COUNTING FROM THE PRESENT KALPA THE BEGINNING OF OUR PRESENT UNIVERSE BUDDHA GAUTAMA IS CONSIDERED THE FOURTH BUDDHA. THE FIRST IS KAKUSANDHO BUDDHA SECOND KONAKAMANO BUDDHA AND THE THIRD KASSAPO BUDDHA. THE LAST BUDDHA OF THIS KALPA WILL BE MAITREYA BUDDHA. THEN THE UNIVERSE WILL RENEW ITSELF AND FROM THEN BEGINS A NEW KALPA.
OLD STORIES SAY THAT SIDDH RTHA GAUTAMA WAS BORN AROUND THE 6TH CENTURY BC.
HE WAS BORN A PRINCE AND WAS UNSURE ABOUT IF HE WANTED TO BECOME A RELIGIOUS MAN OR A PRINCE. AT AGE 29 HE NOTICED PAIN AND SUFFERING. HE THEN WANTED TO LEARN THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM OF HUMAN SUFFERING OR PAIN. HE GAVE UP ALL HIS MONEY AND POWER AND BECAME A MONK WITHOUT A HOME. HE WALKED FROM PLACE TO PLACE TRYING TO LEARN THE ANSWERS TO LIFE.
AT LAST HE GETS ENLIGHTENMENT WHILE SITTING UNDER A BIG TREE CALLED THE BODHI TREE. HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO TEACH BUDDHISM TO THE PEOPLE AND BUDDHISTS LOVE HIM FOR THAT. A CUTTING WAS MADE FROM THE BODHI TREE AND PLANTED IN SRI LANKA. WHEN THE ORIGINAL TREE DIED A CUTTING FROM THE SRI LANKAN TREE WAS PLANTED IN THE ORIGINAL SPOT AND SO TODAY THERE IS A SECOND GENERATION CLONE OF THE FIRST TREE IN THE INDIAN CITY OF BODH GAYA.
AFTER SIDDH RTHA GAUTAMA DIED HIS STUDENTS TAUGHT THE BUDDHA S TEACHING TO MORE PEOPLE. AFTER A LONG TIME THEY WROTE DOWN THE THINGS THAT HE MAY HAVE SAID.
BUDDHISTS OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE THREE JEWELS WHICH ARE THE BUDDHA THE DHARMA AND THE SANGHA.
THE DHARMA IS THE WAY THE BUDDHA TAUGHT TO LIVE YOUR LIFE. THE SANGHA IS THE GROUP OF MONKS AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO MEET TOGETHER LIKE A CONGREGATION.
BUDDHISTS SAY I TAKE REFUGE IN THE BUDDHA THE DHARMA AND THE SANGHA. THIS MEANS THAT THESE THREE THINGS KEEP THEM SAFE. THEY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO THE COMMUNITY AND TEACHINGS INSPIRED BY THE BUDDHA.
THE BUDDHA S FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT TEACHINGS ARE THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS.
THE BUDDHA TOLD PEOPLE TO FOLLOW A SPECIAL WAY OF LIFE CALLED THE NOBLE EIGHTFOLD PATH IF THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS. THESE ARE 
BUDDHISTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO FOLLOW FIVE PRECEPTS OR RULES THAT SAY WHAT NOT TO DO. THE BUDDHA TAUGHT THAT KILLING STEALING HAVING SEX IN A HARMFUL WAY AND LYING ARE NOT SIGNS OF SKILL.
THESE ARE THE FIVE PRECEPTS 
IF A PERSON WANTS TO BE A MONK OR NUN HE OR SHE WILL FOLLOW OTHER PRECEPTS AS WELL.
BUTTERFLY
A BUTTERFLY IS A USUALLY DAY FLYING INSECT OF THE ORDER LEPIDOPTERA. THEY ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN THE SUBORDER RHOPALOCERA. BUTTERFLIES ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO MOTHS FROM WHICH THEY EVOLVED. 
THE LIFE OF BUTTERFLIES IS CLOSELY CONNECTED TO FLOWERING PLANTS WHICH THEIR LARVAE CATERPILLARS FEED ON AND THEIR ADULTS FEED AND LAY THEIR EGGS ON. THEY HAVE A LONG LASTING HISTORY OF CO EVOLUTION WITH FLOWERING PLANTS. MANY OF THE DETAILS OF PLANT ANATOMY ARE RELATED TO THEIR POLLINATORS AND VICE VERSA. THE OTHER NOTABLE FEATURES OF BUTTERFLIES ARE THEIR EXTRAORDINARY RANGE OF COLOURS AND PATTERNS AND THEIR WINGS. THESE ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.
ANGIOSPERMS FLOWERING PLANTS EVOLVED IN THE LOWER CRETACEOUS BUT DID NOT BECOME COMMON UNTIL THE UPPER CRETACEOUS. BUTTERFLIES WERE THE LAST MAJOR GROUP OF INSECTS TO APPEAR ON THE PLANET. THEY EVOLVED FROM MOTHS IN THE LATEST CRETACEOUS OR THE EARLIEST CAINOZOIC. THE EARLIEST KNOWN BUTTERFLY FOSSILS DATE TO THE MID EOCENE EPOCH BETWEEN 40 50 MILLION YEARS AGO.
LIKE MOTHS BUTTERFLIES HAVE FOUR WINGS COVERED WITH TINY SCALES. WHEN A BUTTERFLY IS NOT FLYING ITS WINGS ARE USUALLY FOLDED OVER ITS BACK. THE WINGS ARE PATTERNED AND ARE OFTEN BRIGHTLY COLOURED. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF BUTTERFLIES. THE MALES AND FEMALES OF EACH KIND ARE OFTEN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER. BUTTERFLY WATCHING IS A POPULAR HOBBY. SOME PEOPLE ALSO KEEP COLLECTIONS OF DEAD BUTTERFLIES THAT THEY HAVE CAUGHT. 
LIKE ALL INSECTS WITH COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS A BUTTERFLY S LIFE GOES THROUGH FOUR DISTINCT STAGES. IT BEGINS AS AN EGG WHICH HATCHES INTO A LARVA A CATERPILLAR. AFTER SOME TIME THE LARVA TURNS INTO A CHRYSALIS. WHILE IT IS IN THE CHRYSALIS STAGE IT BECOMES A BUTTERFLY. THE BUTTERFLY THEN HATCHES OUT AND LAYS MORE EGGS.
THE MAIN PREDATORS OF BUTTERFLIES ARE BIRDS JUST AS THE MAIN PREDATORS OF THE CREPUSCULAR MOTHS ARE BATS. ALSO MONKEYS AND TREE DWELLING REPTILES ARE PREDATORS AND SOME INSECTS AND SPIDERS. CERTAINLY ALL REPTILES AND MONKEYS HAVE GOOD COLOUR VISION SO THAT BUTTERFLY COLORATION WORKS JUST AS WELL ON THEM AS IT DOES ON BIRDS.
THE EXTRAORDINARY COLORS AND PATTERNS ON THE WINGS AND BODY CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF THEIR FUNCTION. SOME OF THE MOST OBVIOUS FUNCTIONS OF COLOR ARE 
THE DETAILS VARY FROM GROUP TO GROUP AND FROM SPECIES TO SPECIES. THE CATERPILLARS ALSO HAVE COLOURS WITH SIMILAR FUNCTIONS. THE POISONOUS SUBSTANCES WHICH MAKE SOME BUTTERFLIES NOXIOUS TO EAT ARE DERIVED FROM THE PLANTS EATEN BY THEIR CATERPILLARS.
LIKE MOST INSECTS BUTTERFLIES HAVE THREE MAIN BODY PARTS. THESE PARTS ARE THE HEAD THE THORAX AND THE ABDOMEN. THE BODY IS PROTECTED BY THE EXOSKELETON. THE BODY IS MADE UP OF SECTIONS KNOWN AS SEGMENTS. IN BETWEEN THE SEGMENTS THERE ARE FLEXIBLE AREAS THAT ALLOW THE BUTTERFLY TO MOVE. ALL THREE PARTS OF THE BODY ARE COVERED IN VERY SMALL SCALES. THE SCALES GIVE THE BUTTERFLY ITS COLOR.
BUTTERFLIES HAVE A VERY CHARACTERISTIC FLYING STYLE. THEY USUALLY DO NOT FLY IN STRAIGHT LINES. THEIR STYLE IS WELL DESCRIBED BY THE CHILDREN S VERSION OF THEIR NAME FLUTTER BY. SOME SPECIES ARE CAPABLE OF STRONG LONG FLIGHTS SEE MONARCH BUTTERFLY MIGRATION AND OTHERS NEVER LEAVE THE WOODS THEY WERE BORN IN. THEY CAN SURVIVE BIRD PECKS ON THE WINGS QUITE WELL. LATE IN THE SEASON DAMAGE TO THEIR WINGS CAN OFTEN BE SEEN AND STILL THEY CONTINUE FLYING QUITE WELL.
THE HEAD IS THE FIRST PART OF THE BODY. IT HAS THE EYES MOUTH PARTS AND ANTENNAE.
THE EYES OF A BUTTERFLY ARE LARGE. THE EYE IS MADE UP OF SMALLER EYES OR OPTICAL UNITS. EYES THAT ARE MADE UP OF OPTICAL UNITS ARE CALLED COMPOUND EYES. BUTTERFLIES DO NOT SEE AS MANY COLORS AS HUMANS BUT THEY CAN SEE ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT.
THE MOUTH OF AN ADULT BUTTERFLY DOES NOT HAVE JAWS. IT HAS A KIND OF MOUTH THAT IS MADE TO SUCK LIQUIDS. THIS MOUTH IS CALLED A PROBOSCIS. THE PROBOSCIS IS MADE UP OF TWO HOLLOW TUBES. THE TUBES ARE LOCKED TOGETHER IN THE MIDDLE. WHEN THE BUTTERFLY IS NOT USING ITS PROBOSCIS IT IS COILED UP IN THE HEAD. IT CAN UNCOIL THE PROBOSCIS WHEN IT WANTS TO FEED.
THE ANTENNAE OF A BUTTERFLY ARE USED FOR SMELL AND BALANCE. THE ANTENNA IN MOST BUTTERFLIES IS CLUBBED AT THE END. IN SOME BUTTERFLIES LIKE THE SKIPPERS THERE IS A HOOK AT THE END OF THE ANTENNA INSTEAD OF A CLUB.
THE THORAX IS THE SECOND PART OF THE BODY. IT IS MADE UP OF THREE SEGMENTS. THE LEGS AND WINGS ARE CONNECTED TO THE THORAX.
THE LEGS OF A BUTTERFLY ARE MADE FOR WALKING HOLDING ONTO THINGS AND TASTING. THERE ARE THREE PAIRS OF LEGS. THERE ARE FOUR MAIN PARTS OF THE LEG. THEY ARE THE TROCHANTER THE FEMUR THE TIBIA AND THE FOOT. AT THE END OF EACH FOOT THERE IS A PAIR OF CLAWS. BUTTERFLIES IN THE FAMILY NYMPHALIDAE HAVE VERY SHORT FRONT LEGS. THEY KEEP THERE FRONT LEGS CLOSE TO THEIR BODIES. THIS MAKES IT LOOK LIKE THEY ONLY HAVE TWO PAIRS OF LEGS. IN SOME SPECIES THERE IS A MOVABLE BODY PART ON THE TIBIA THAT IS USED TO CLEAN THE ANTENNAE.
A BUTTERFLY HAS TWO PAIRS OF WINGS. EACH WING HAS HOLLOW TUBES CALLED VEINS. THE COLORS AND PATTERNS OF BUTTERFLIES ARE MADE BY TINY SCALES. THE SCALES OVER LAP EACH OTHER. THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THE WING. IF A BUTTERFLY IS HANDLED THE TINY SCALES MAY RUB OFF.
THE ABDOMEN IS THE THIRD PART OF THE BODY. IT IS MADE UP OF TEN SEGMENTS. THE ABDOMEN IS MUCH SOFTER THAN THE HEAD AND THE THORAX. AT THE END OF THE ABDOMEN ARE THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. IN THE MALE THERE IS A PAIR OF CLASPERS. THEY ARE USED TO HOLD ON TO THE FEMALE DURING MATING. IN THE FEMALE THERE IS A TUBE MADE TO LAY EGGS.
BUTTERFLIES GO THROUGH COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS. THIS MEANS THAT THERE ARE FOUR PARTS IN A BUTTERFLY S LIFE. THE FIRST PART IS THE EGG. THE SECOND PART IS THE CATERPILLAR SOMETIMES CALLED THE LARVA. THE THIRD PART IS THE CHRYSALIS SOMETIMES CALLED THE PUPA. THE FOURTH PART IS THE ADULT SOMETIMES CALLED THE IMAGO.
A FEMALE BUTTERFLY WILL LAY HER EGGS ON OR NEAR THE FOOD PLANT OF THE CATERPILLAR THE FOOD PLANT IS THE PLANT THAT THE CATERPILLAR FEEDS ON. THE FEMALE WILL CHOOSE A PLACE TO LAY HER EGGS USING SMELL TASTE TOUCH AND SIGHT. MOST SPECIES WILL LAY JUST ONE EGG ON THE FOOD PLANT. OTHERS WILL LAY GROUPS OF FIVE TO OVER 100 EGGS ON THE FOOD PLANT. MOST SPECIES WILL LAY THEIR EGGS ON THE LEAVES OF THE FOOD PLANT. OTHERS WILL LAY THEM ON THE FLOWERS STEMS BARK OR FRUIT OF THE FOOD PLANT.
THE EGGS COME IN MANY DIFFERENT SHAPES AND COLORS. THEY MAY BE ROUND OR OVAL AND FLATTENED. IN SOME SPECIES THE EGG SHELL IS RIBBED. THE MOST COMMON COLORS IN BUTTERFLY EGGS ARE YELLOW AND GREEN. THE EGGS WILL TURN DARK JUST BEFORE HATCHING. ALSO SOME BUTTERFLIES TAKE A DAY TO COME OUT OF EGGS WHILE OTHERS COULD TAKE MONTHS.
BUTTERFLY CATERPILLARS CAN VARY IN SIZE COLOR AND SHAPE. THEY MAY HAVE SPINES BRISTLES OR SOFT BODY EXTENSIONS. ALL CATERPILLARS HAVE 13 BODY SEGMENTS. THE FIRST THREE SEGMENTS MAKE UP THE THORAX. THE THORAX HAS THREE PAIRS OF LEGS. THESE LEGS ARE CALLED TRUE LEGS. THE OTHER 10 SEGMENTS MAKE UP THE ABDOMEN. THE ABDOMEN HAS FIVE PAIRS OF SOFT LEGS CALLED PROLEGS. THE PROLEGS HAVE TINY HOOKS AT THE END OF THE EACH FOOT. THEY ARE USED TO HOLD ON TO THINGS. THE HOOKS ARE CALLED CROCHETS.
A CATERPILLAR S SKIN DOES NOT GROW. AS THE CATERPILLAR GROWS INSIDE ITS SKIN THE SKIN BECOMES TOO TIGHT. IN ORDER FOR THE CATERPILLAR TO GROW BIGGER IT SHEDS ITS TOO TIGHT SKIN. AFTER THE OLD SKIN IS SHED THERE IS A NEW LARGER SKIN. THIS IS KNOWN AS MOLTING. A CATERPILLAR WILL MOLT FOUR TO FIVE TIMES BEFORE TURNING INTO A PUPA. EACH PART BETWEEN MOLTS IS CALLED AN INSTAR.
ALL CATERPILLARS CAN MAKE SILK. THE SILK IS MADE FROM THE SALIVARY GLANDS. SILK STARTS OUT AS A LIQUID IN THE SALIVARY GLANDS. THE CATERPILLAR DRAWS OUT THE SILK INTO A SMALL THREAD. THE SILK HARDENS AS SOON AS IT IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR. CATERPILLARS USE SILK TO MAKE NESTS OR COCOONS.
MOST CATERPILLARS FEED ON LEAVES OF PLANTS OR TREES. MOST SPECIES OF CATERPILLARS WILL FEED ONLY ON A SMALL NUMBER OF CERTAIN KINDS OF PLANTS. IF THE CATERPILLAR S FOOD PLANT IS NOT FOUND IT WILL STARVE TO DEATH.
SOME SPECIES OF CATERPILLARS IN THE FAMILY LYCAENIDAE ARE TENDED BY ANTS. THE CATERPILLARS HAVE SPECIAL GLANDS THAT MAKE A SWEET LIQUID CALLED HONEYDEW. THE ANTS LIKE THE HONEYDEW. IN RETURN FOR THE HONEYDEW THE ANTS PROTECT THE CATERPILLARS FROM PREDATORS. THE CATERPILLARS ALSO HAVE SPECIAL BODY PARTS THAT MAKE SOUNDS. THE CATERPILLAR WILL MAKE SOUNDS WITH THE BODY PARTS AND CALL THE ANTS WHEN THE CATERPILLAR IS BEING ATTACKED BY PREDATORS. THE ANTS HEAR THE SOUNDS AND COME TO PROTECT THE CATERPILLAR.
CATERPILLARS IN THE SUBFAMILY MILETINAE EAT INSECTS IN THE ORDER HEMIPTERA. THIS INCLUDES APHIDS MEALYBUGS LEAFHOPPERS AND TREEHOPPERS.
CATERPILLARS IN THE FAMILY PAPILIONIDAE HAVE A SPECIAL ORGAN. THIS ORGAN IS CALLED AN OSMETERIUM. IT IS A BAD SMELLING GLAND THAT IS SHAPED LIKE A SNAKE S TONGUE. IT IS KEPT BEHIND THE INSIDE OF THE HEAD. WHEN A PREDATOR TRIES TO EAT THE CATERPILLAR THE CATERPILLAR WILL RELEASE THE OSMETERIUM. THIS SCARES THE PREDATORS AWAY.
THE PUPA PLURAL PUPAE IS FORMED AFTER THE LAST MOLT. THE CATERPILLAR WILL FIND A SPECIAL PLACE TO PUPATE PUPATE MEANS TO TURN INTO A PUPA. THE DIGESTIVE TRACT IS EMPTIED. THE CATERPILLAR SHEDS ITS SKIN. THE PUPA IS NOW EXPOSED. THE CATERPILLAR S TISSUES ARE BROKEN DOWN AND REBUILT INTO THE BUTTERFLY S TISSUES.
THE PUPA CANNOT MOVE. IT IS ATTACHED TO AN OBJECT BY TINY HOOKS ON THE END OF THE ABDOMEN. THESE HOOKS MAKE UP WHAT IS CALLED THE CREMASTER. THERE ARE MANY TINY HOLES ON THE PUPA. THEY ALLOW RESPIRATORY GASES TO MOVE IN AND OUT OF THE PUPA.
MANY PUPAE ARE EASY FOR PREDATORS TO ATTACK. SOME CATERPILLARS IN THE FAMILY HESPERIIDAE AND THE SUBFAMILIES PARNASSIINAE AND SATYRINAE MAKE SHELTERS OUT OF SILK AND LEAVES TO PROTECT THEMSELVES WHEN THEY BECOME PUPAE. THESE SHELTERS ARE CALLED COCOONS. MOST BUTTERFLY PUPAE DO NOT HAVE COCOONS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. INSTEAD THE PUPAE HAVE BROWN OR GREEN COLORS TO CAMOUFLAGE THEMSELVES AMONG LEAVES AND BRANCHES. PUPAE THAT DO NOT HAVE COCOONS ARE CALLED CHRYSALIDS OR CHRYSALISES.
SOME BUTTERFLIES MAY BE IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF HABITAT LOSS. BECAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION OF FORESTS AND GRASSLANDS SOME TYPES OF BUTTERFLIES HAVE NOWHERE TO FEED AND LAY EGGS. TO HELP SOME PEOPLE PLANT A BUTTERFLY GARDEN WITH FLOWERS HAVING LOTS OF NECTAR FOR BUTTERFLIES TO FEED ON. SOME PEOPLE ALSO KEEP PLANTS THAT BUTTERFLIES LAY EGGS ON AND ENJOY WATCHING THE CATERPILLARS HATCH OUT AND FEED ON THE PLANT. CHEMICAL SPRAYS THAT ARE USED TO KEEP PESTS AWAY FROM GARDEN PLANTS ALSO KILL BUTTERFLIES.
BYZANTINE EMPIRE
THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE OR EASTERN ROMAN EMPIRE WAS THE NAME OF THE EASTERN REMNANT OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE WHICH SURVIVED INTO THE MIDDLE AGES. ITS CAPITAL WAS CONSTANTINOPLE WHICH TODAY IS IN TURKEY AND IS NOW CALLED ISTANBUL. UNLIKE THE WESTERN ROMAN EMPIRE THE MOST IMPORTANT LANGUAGE WAS GREEK NOT LATIN. GREEK CULTURE AND IDENTITY DOMINATED.
IN 324 THE ROMAN EMPEROR CONSTANTINE I MOVED THE CAPITAL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE TO THE CITY OF BYZANTIUM AND HE RENAMED THE CITY CONSTANTINOPLE. 150 YEARS LATER AFTER THE CITY OF ROME WAS SLOWLY TAKEN OVER BY GERMANIC PEOPLE DURING THE MIGRATION PERIOD CONSTANTINOPLE WAS THE ONLY REMAINING CAPITAL OF THE EMPIRE. THIS EASTERN EMPIRE HAD A SMALLER TERRITORY THAN THE ORIGINAL ROMAN EMPIRE.
THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE TRIED TO TAKE BACK ROME AND ITALY FROM THE GERMANS. BETWEEN 530 555 AD THE BYZANTINES WON MANY BATTLES AND TOOK BACK ROME.
THESE GAINS DID NOT LAST HOWEVER. MORE GERMANS CAME AND EVENTUALLY ITALY AND ROME WAS LOST AGAIN. WORSE WAS TO COME WHEN AVAR AND SLAVIC PEOPLES CAME TO TAKE MODERN BULGARIA AND GREECE FROM THE BYZANTINES. GRADUALLY AFTER THE 560S THE INVADERS WON MUCH OF THE BALKANS. THESE INVADERS WERE LATER FOLLOWED BY THE BULGARIANS. THE AVARS AND BULGARIANS WERE BOTH TURKISH PEOPLES AT FIRST. THEY RULED OVER SLAVIC PEOPLE CALLED SKLAVINAI AND SLOWLY ABSORBED SLAVIC LANGUAGE AND CUSTOMS.
AFTER WESTERN ROME WAS CAPTURED BY GERMANIC PEOPLE THE EMPIRE CONTINUED TO CONTROL MODERN EGYPT GREECE PALESTINE SYRIA AND TURKEY. HOWEVER ANOTHER EMPIRE KNOWN AS THE PERSIAN OR SASSANID EMPIRE TRIED TO TAKE THESE LANDS FOR ITSELF. BETWEEN 224 628 AD THE ROMANS AND THE PERSIANS FOUGHT MANY BATTLES WITH MANY MEN KILLED IN THE FIGHTING. EVENTUALLY THE PERSIANS WERE DEFEATED IN MODERN DAY IRAQ NEAR THE ANCIENT CITY OF NINEVEH IN 627 AD ALLOWING THE BYZANTINES TO KEEP THEIR LANDS.
AFTER THIS ANOTHER ENEMY APPEARED THE ARABS. THE BYZANTINES WERE ECONOMICALLY DAMAGED BY THE BATTLES WITH THE PERSIANS. THEY COULD NOT WITHSTAND THE ARABS. PALESTINE SYRIA AND EGYPT WERE LOST BETWEEN 635 AND 645. HOWEVER THE BYZANTINES DEFENDED ASIA MINOR MODERN TURKEY AND THE ARAB ADVANCE STOPPED.
IN 718 AD THE ARABS WERE DEFEATED OUTSIDE CONSTANTINOPLE ENDING THE ARAB THREAT IN THE EAST BUT LEAVING THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE SEVERELY WEAKENED. IN THE WEST THE BYZANTINES LAUNCHED A NUMBER OF ATTACKS AGAINST THE BULGARIANS. SOME OF THESE WERE SUCCESSFUL OTHERS WERE NOT AND LED TO THE DEATHS OF MANY EMPERORS. OVER TIME THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE WOULD BECAME WEAKER AS IT LOSS LAND TO OUTSIDE INVADERS.
BETWEEN 1007 1014 THE AMBITIOUS BYZANTINE EMPEROR BASIL II ATTACKED BULGARIA MANY TIMES AND EVENTUALLY WON A GREAT VICTORY. LATER HE FULLY RECAPTURED GREECE ADDING IT BACK TO THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE. HE THEN WENT ON TO CONQUER BULGARIA WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN 1018.
IN THE EAST THE ARABS ONCE AGAIN BECAME A THREAT TO THE EMPIRE. HOWEVER BASIL II S ATTACKS WON MANY MORE VICTORIES. MUCH OF SYRIA WAS RESTORED TO THE EMPIRE AND TURKEY AND ARMENIA WERE SECURED. AFTER 1025 THE ARABS WERE NO LONGER A THREAT TO THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE.
AFTER THE BYZANTINE EMPEROR BASIL II DIED MANY UNSKILLED EMPERORS CAME TO THE THRONE. THEY WASTED THE MONEY OF THE EMPIRE AND REDUCED HER ARMY. THIS MEANT THAT SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF WELL AGAINST ENEMIES IF THEY WOULD ATTACK. LATER THE BYZANTINES RELIED ON MERCENARIES SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT FOR MONEY AND NOT FOR THEIR COUNTRY SO THEY WERE LESS LOYAL AND RELIABLE AND MORE EXPENSIVE. BECAUSE THEY HAD MERCENARIES MILITARY GENERALS WERE ABLE TO RISE TO POWER AND GRAB IT FROM THE ELABORATE BUREAUCRACY A SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION WHERE TASKS ARE DIVIDED BY DEPARTMENTS.
A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KNOWN AS THE TURKS RODE ON HORSEBACK FROM CENTRAL ASIA AND ATTACKED THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE. THEY TOOK ALL OF TURKEY FROM THE BYZANTINES BY 1091. HOWEVER THE BYZANTINES RECEIVED HELP FROM PEOPLE IN EUROPE. THIS HELP IS KNOWN AS THE FIRST CRUSADE. MANY KNIGHTS AND SOLDIERS LEFT TO HELP THE BYZANTINES BUT ALSO TO SECURE JERUSALEM FOR CHRISTIANS WHICH AT THE TIME WAS IN MUSLIM HANDS.
THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE SURVIVED AND WITH THE HELP OF THE EUROPEANS TOOK BACK HALF OF TURKEY FROM THE TURKS WITH THE OTHER HALF REMAINING UNDER THE TURKS. THE BYZANTINES SURVIVED BECAUSE THREE GOOD EMPERORS RULED ONE AFTER THE OTHER ALLOWING THE BYZANTINES TO GROW STRONG AGAIN.
AFTER THE THREE GOOD EMPERORS THE REMAINING EMPERORS RULED BADLY AND AGAIN WASTED A LOT OF MONEY AND SOLDIERS.
IN THE WEST THE EUROPEANS BETRAYED THE BYZANTINES AND ATTACKED THEIR CAPITAL CONSTANTINOPLE. THE BYZANTINES LOST THEIR CAPITAL IN 1204 AND THEY DID NOT TAKE IT BACK UNTIL 1261. THE BYZANTINES WERE THEN DIVIDED INTO MANY SMALLER GREEK STATES THAT WERE FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER FOR THE THRONE OF THE EMPIRE.
AFTER THE BYZANTINES TOOK BACK CONSTANTINOPLE THEY WERE TOO BUSY FIGHTING THE EUROPEANS WHO HAD BETRAYED THEM AND COULD NOT FIND ENOUGH SOLDIERS OR MONEY TO FIGHT THE NEW OTTOMAN EMPIRE OF THE TURKS. ALL OF ANATOLIA WAS LOST BY 1331. IN 1369 THE TURKS CROSSED OVER FROM TURKEY AND INTO GREECE TAKING OVER MUCH OF GREECE BETWEEN 1354 1450. 
THE BYZANTINES LOST SO MUCH LAND MONEY AND SOLDIERS THAT THEY BECAME VERY WEAK AND BEGGED FOR HELP FROM THE EUROPEANS. SOME SOLDIERS AND SHIPS CAME FROM ITALY AND THE POPE TO ASSIST THE BYZANTINES WHEN THE TURKS ATTACKED CONSTANTINOPLE IN APRIL 1453. THEY WERE VERY OUTNUMBERED THOUGH AND THE WALLS OF CONSTANTINOPLE WERE BADLY DAMAGED BY CANNONS USED BY THE TURKS. AT THE END OF MAY 1453 THE TURKS CAPTURED CONSTANTINOPLE BY ENTERING THROUGH ONE OF THE GATES ALONG THE WALLS AND THE EMPIRE CAME TO AN END. THE CITY WAS PLUNDERED FOR THREE DAYS. AT THE END THE POPULATION WHICH HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE WAS DEPORTED TO EDIRNE BURSA AND OTHER OTTOMAN CITIES LEAVING THE CITY DESERTED EXCEPT FOR THE JEWS OF BALAT AND THE GENOESE OF PERA. AFTER THAT CONSTANTINOPLE BECAME ISTANBUL THE CAPITAL OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE WHICH IT WOULD BE UNTIL THE 1900S WHEN THE CAPITAL WAS MOVED TO ANKARA A CITY IN THE ASIAN PART OF TURKEY.
THE EMPIRE HAD MANY ACHIEVEMENTS 
CALCULUS
CALCULUS IS A BRANCH OF MATHEMATICS WHICH HELPS US UNDERSTAND CHANGES BETWEEN VALUES THAT ARE RELATED BY A FUNCTION. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD ONE FORMULA TELLING HOW MUCH MONEY YOU GOT EVERY DAY CALCULUS WOULD HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RELATED FORMULAS LIKE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE IN TOTAL AND WHETHER YOU ARE GETTING MORE MONEY OR LESS THAN YOU USED TO. ALL THESE FORMULAS ARE FUNCTIONS OF TIME AND SO THAT IS ONE WAY TO THINK OF CALCULUS STUDYING FUNCTIONS OF TIME. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CALCULUS. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS DIVIDES THINGS INTO SMALL DIFFERENT PIECES AND TELLS US HOW THEY CHANGE FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT WHILE INTEGRAL CALCULUS JOINS INTEGRATES THE SMALL PIECES TOGETHER AND TELLS US HOW MUCH OF SOMETHING IS MADE OVERALL BY A SERIES OF CHANGES. CALCULUS IS USED IN MANY DIFFERENT AREAS OF STUDY SUCH AS PHYSICS ASTRONOMY BIOLOGY ENGINEERING ECONOMICS MEDICINE AND SOCIOLOGY.
IN THE 1670S AND 1680S SIR ISAAC NEWTON IN ENGLAND AND GOTTFRIED LEIBNIZ IN GERMANY FIGURED OUT CALCULUS AT THE SAME TIME WORKING SEPARATELY FROM EACH OTHER. NEWTON WANTED TO HAVE A NEW WAY TO PREDICT WHERE TO SEE PLANETS IN THE SKY BECAUSE ASTRONOMY HAD ALWAYS BEEN A POPULAR AND USEFUL FORM OF SCIENCE AND KNOWING MORE ABOUT THE MOTIONS OF THE OBJECTS IN THE NIGHT SKY WAS IMPORTANT FOR NAVIGATION OF SHIPS. LEIBNIZ WANTED TO MEASURE THE SPACE AREA UNDER A CURVE A LINE WHICH IS NOT STRAIGHT. MANY YEARS LATER THE TWO MEN ARGUED OVER WHO DISCOVERED IT FIRST. SCIENTISTS FROM ENGLAND SUPPORTED NEWTON BUT SCIENTISTS FROM THE REST OF EUROPE SUPPORTED LEIBNIZ. MOST MATHEMATICIANS TODAY AGREE THAT BOTH MEN SHARE THE CREDIT EQUALLY. SOME PARTS OF MODERN CALCULUS COME FROM NEWTON SUCH AS ITS USES IN PHYSICS. OTHER PARTS COME FROM LEIBNIZ SUCH AS THE SYMBOLS USED TO WRITE IT.
THEY WERE NOT THE FIRST PEOPLE TO USE MATHEMATICS TO DESCRIBE THE PHYSICAL WORLD ARISTOTLE AND PYTHAGORAS CAME EARLIER AND SO DID GALILEO WHO SAID THAT MATHEMATICS WAS THE LANGUAGE OF SCIENCE. BUT THEY WERE THE FIRST TO DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT DESCRIBES HOW THINGS CHANGE OVER TIME AND CAN PREDICT HOW THEY WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.
THE NAME CALCULUS WAS THE LATIN WORD FOR A SMALL STONE THE ANCIENT ROMANS USED IN COUNTING AND GAMBLING. THE ENGLISH WORD CALCULATE COMES FROM THE SAME LATIN WORD.
DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS IS THE PROCESS OF FINDING OUT THE RATE OF CHANGE OF A VARIABLE COMPARED TO ANOTHER VARIABLE. IT CAN BE USED TO FIND THE SPEED OF A MOVING OBJECT OR THE SLOPE OF A CURVE FIGURE OUT THE MAXIMUM OR MINIMUM POINTS OF A CURVE OR FIND ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS IN THE ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM AREAS OF PHYSICS AMONG MANY OTHER USES.
MANY AMOUNTS CAN BE VARIABLES WHICH CAN CHANGE THEIR VALUE UNLIKE NUMBERS SUCH AS 5 OR 200. SOME EXAMPLES OF VARIABLES ARE DISTANCE AND TIME. THE SPEED OF AN OBJECT IS HOW FAR IT TRAVELS IN A PARTICULAR TIME. SO IF A TOWN IS 80 KILOMETRES 50 MILES AWAY AND A PERSON IN A CAR GETS THERE IN ONE HOUR THEY HAVE TRAVELED AT AN AVERAGE SPEED OF 80 KILOMETRES 50 MILES PER HOUR. BUT THIS IS ONLY AN AVERAGE THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TRAVELING FASTER AT SOME TIMES ON A HIGHWAY AND SLOWER AT OTHERS AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT OR ON A SMALL STREET WHERE PEOPLE LIVE. IMAGINE A DRIVER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A CAR S SPEED USING ONLY ITS ODOMETER DISTANCE METER AND CLOCK WITHOUT A SPEEDOMETER 
UNTIL CALCULUS WAS INVENTED THE ONLY WAY TO WORK THIS OUT WAS TO CUT THE TIME INTO SMALLER AND SMALLER PIECES SO THE AVERAGE SPEED OVER THE SMALLER TIME WOULD GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE ACTUAL SPEED AT A POINT IN TIME. THIS WAS A VERY LONG AND HARD PROCESS AND HAD TO BE DONE EACH TIME PEOPLE WANTED TO WORK SOMETHING OUT.
A VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM IS TO FIND THE SLOPE HOW STEEP IT IS AT ANY POINT ON A CURVE. THE SLOPE OF A STRAIGHT LINE IS EASY TO WORK OUT IT IS SIMPLY HOW MUCH IT GOES UP Y OR VERTICAL DIVIDED BY HOW MUCH IT GOES ACROSS X OR HORIZONTAL. ON A CURVE THOUGH THE SLOPE IS A VARIABLE HAS DIFFERENT VALUES AT DIFFERENT POINTS BECAUSE THE LINE BENDS. BUT IF THE CURVE WAS TO BE CUT INTO VERY VERY SMALL PIECES THE CURVE AT THE POINT WOULD LOOK ALMOST LIKE A VERY SHORT STRAIGHT LINE. SO TO WORK OUT ITS SLOPE A STRAIGHT LINE CAN BE DRAWN THROUGH THE POINT WITH THE SAME SLOPE AS THE CURVE AT THAT POINT. IF IT IS DONE EXACTLY RIGHT THE STRAIGHT LINE WILL HAVE THE SAME SLOPE AS THE CURVE AND IS CALLED A TANGENT. BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO KNOW WITHOUT VERY COMPLICATED MATHEMATICS WHETHER THE TANGENT IS EXACTLY RIGHT AND OUR EYES ARE NOT ACCURATE ENOUGH TO BE CERTAIN WHETHER IT IS EXACT OR SIMPLY VERY CLOSE.
WHAT NEWTON AND LEIBNIZ FOUND WAS A WAY TO WORK OUT THE SLOPE OR THE SPEED IN THE DISTANCE EXAMPLE EXACTLY USING SIMPLE AND LOGICAL RULES. THEY DIVIDED THE CURVE INTO AN INFINITE NUMBER OF VERY SMALL PIECES. THEY THEN CHOSE POINTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RANGE THEY WERE INTERESTED IN AND WORKED OUT TANGENTS AT EACH. AS THE POINTS MOVED CLOSER TOGETHER TOWARDS THE POINT THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE SLOPE APPROACHED A PARTICULAR VALUE AS THE TANGENTS APPROACHED THE REAL SLOPE OF THE CURVE. THEY SAID THAT THIS PARTICULAR VALUE IT APPROACHED WAS THE ACTUAL SLOPE.
LET S SAY WE HAVE A FUNCTION Y F X. F IS SHORT FOR FUNCTION SO THIS EQUATION MEANS Y IS A FUNCTION OF X. THIS TELLS US THAT HOW HIGH Y IS ON THE VERTICAL AXIS DEPENDS ON WHAT X THE HORIZONTAL AXIS IS AT THAT TIME. FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE EQUATION Y X WE KNOW THAT IF X IS 1 THEN Y WILL BE 1 IF X IS 3 THEN Y WILL BE 9 IF X IS 20 THEN Y WILL BE 400.
FORMULA 1
IF WE USE Y X THE DERIVATIVE PRODUCED USING THIS METHOD IS 2 X OR 2 MULTIPLIED BY X. SO WE KNOW WITHOUT HAVING TO DRAW ANY TANGENT LINES THAT AT ANY POINT ON THE CURVE F X X THE DERIVATIVE F X MARKED WITH THE PRIME SYMBOL WILL BE 2 X AT ANY POINT. THIS PROCESS OF WORKING OUT A SLOPE USING LIMITS IS CALLED DIFFERENTIATION OR FINDING THE DERIVATIVE.
LEIBNIZ CAME TO THE SAME RESULT BUT CALLED H DX WHICH MEANS WITH RESPECT TO X. HE CALLED THE RESULTING CHANGE IN F X DY WHICH MEANS A TINY AMOUNT OF Y. LEIBNIZ S NOTATION IS USED BY MORE BOOKS BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THE EQUATIONS BECOME MORE COMPLICATED. IN LEIBNIZ NOTATION 
FORMULA 2
MATHEMATICIANS HAVE GROWN THIS BASIC THEORY TO MAKE SIMPLE ALGEBRA RULES WHICH CAN BE USED TO FIND THE DERIVATIVE OF ALMOST ANY FUNCTION.
THE MAIN IDEA IN CALCULUS IS CALLED THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS. THIS MAIN IDEA SAYS THAT THE TWO CALCULUS PROCESSES DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL CALCULUS ARE OPPOSITES. THAT IS A PERSON CAN USE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS TO UNDO AN INTEGRAL CALCULUS PROCESS. ALSO A PERSON CAN USE INTEGRAL CALCULUS TO UNDO A DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS METHOD. THIS IS JUST LIKE USING DIVISION TO UNDO MULTIPLICATION OR ADDITION TO UNDO SUBTRACTION.
IN A SINGLE SENTENCE THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM RUNS SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE DERIVATIVE OF THE INTEGRAL OF A FUNCTION F IS THE FUNCTION ITSELF.
THE METHOD INTEGRAL CALCULUS USES TO FIND AREAS OF SHAPES IS TO BREAK THE SHAPE UP INTO MANY SMALL BOXES AND ADD UP THE AREA OF EACH OF THE BOXES. THIS GIVES AN APPROXIMATION TO THE AREA. IF THE BOXES ARE MADE NARROWER AND NARROWER THEN THERE ARE MORE AND MORE OF THEM AND THE AREA OF ALL THE BOXES BECOMES VERY CLOSE TO THE AREA OF THE SHAPE. ONE OF THE MAIN IDEAS OF CALCULUS IS THAT WE CAN IMAGINE HAVING AN INFINITE NUMBER OF THESE BOXES EACH INFINITELY NARROW AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE THE EXACT AREA OF THE SHAPE.
CALCULUS IS USED TO DESCRIBE THINGS THAT CHANGE LIKE THINGS IN NATURE. IT CAN BE USED FOR SHOWING AND LEARNING ALL OF THESE 
CANTILEVER BRIDGE
A CANTILEVER BRIDGE IS A BRIDGE BUILT USING A. A CANTILEVER IS ONLY SUPPORTED ON ONE END. FOR SMALL FOOTBRIDGES THE CANTILEVERS MAY BE SIMPLE BEAMS. FOR LARGE CANTILEVER BRIDGES DESIGNED FOR ROAD OR RAIL TRAFFIC THE CANTILEVERS ARE TRUSSES BUILT FROM STRUCTURAL STEEL OR BOX GIRDERS BUILT FROM PRESTRESSED CONCRETE. THE STEEL TRUSS CANTILEVER BRIDGE WAS A MAJOR ENGINEERING BREAKTHROUGH WHEN IT WAS FIRST USED BECAUSE IT CAN SPAN DISTANCES OF OVER. THEY CAN BE MORE EASILY BUILT AT DIFFICULT CROSSINGS AS THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE SUPPORTED DURING THE CONSTRUCTION.
ENGINEERS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY KNEW THAT A BRIDGE WHICH WAS BUILT ACROSS MULTIPLE SUPPORTS WOULD DISTRIBUTE THE LOADS AMONG THEM. THIS MEANT THERE WOULD BE LOWER STRESSES IN THE GIRDER OR TRUSS AND MEANT THAT LONGER SPANS COULD BE BUILT. SEVERAL NINETEENTH CENTURY ENGINEERS DESIGNED CONTINUOUS BRIDGES WITH HINGE POINTS MID SPAN. THE USE OF A HINGE IN THE MULTI SPAN SYSTEM MEANT THAT ENGINEERS COULD BETTER WORK OUT THE LOADS AND STRESSES ON THE BRIDGE IT ALSO MEANT THE BRIDGE COULD HANDLE THE FOUNDATIONS SETTLING AT DIFFERENT RATES. 
HEINRICH GERBER WAS ONE OF THE ENGINEERS TO OBTAIN A PATENT FOR A HINGED GIRDER 1866 AND IS RECOGNIZED AS THE FIRST TO BUILD ONE. THE HASSFURT BRIDGE OVER THE MAIN RIVER IN GERMANY HAS A CENTRAL SPAN OF 124 FEET 38 METERS. COMPLETED IN 1867 IT WAS THE FIRST MODERN CANTILEVER BRIDGE. OTHER EARLY CANTILEVER BRIDGES INCLUDED THE HIGH BRIDGE OF KENTUCKY BY C. SHALER SMITH 1877 THE NIAGARA CANTILEVER BRIDGE BY CHARLES CONRAD SCHNEIDER 1883 AND THE POUGHKEEPSIE BRIDGE BY JOHN FRANCIS O ROURKE AND POMEROY P. DICKINSON 1889. THE KENTUCKY RIVER BRIDGE SPANNED A GORGE THAT WAS 275 FEET 84 METERS DEEP. IT WAS BUILT WITH A CANTILVER WHICH MEANT THAT IT DID NOT NEED TO BE SUPPORTED DURING THE BUILDING. THE MOST FAMOUS EARLY CANTILEVER BRIDGE IS THE FORTH RAIL BRIDGE. THIS BRIDGE HELD THE RECORD FOR LONGEST SPAN IN THE WORLD FOR 17 YEARS.
BENJAMIN BAKER SHOWED HOW THE CANTILEVER SYSTEM WORKED IN THE PHOTO ON THE LEFT. THE SUSPENDED SPAN WHERE KAICHI WATANABE SITS IS SEEN IN THE CENTER. THE NEED TO RESIST COMPRESSION OF THE LOWER CHORD IS SEEN IN THE USE OF WOODEN POLES WHILE THE TENSION OF THE UPPER CHORD IS SHOWN BY THE OUTSTRETCHED ARMS. THE ACTION OF THE OUTER FOUNDATIONS AS ANCHORS FOR THE CANTILEVER CAN BE SEEN IN THE PLACEMENT OF THE COUNTERWEIGHTS. 
A SIMPLE CANTILEVER SPAN IS FORMED BY TWO CANTILEVER ARMS EXTENDING FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE OBSTACLE TO BE CROSSED MEETING AT THE CENTER. WITH A SUSPENDED SPAN THE CANTILEVER ARMS DO NOT MEET IN THE CENTER INSTEAD THEY SUPPORT A CENTRAL TRUSS BRIDGE WHICH RESTS ON THE ENDS OF THE CANTILEVER ARMS. THE SUSPENDED SPAN MAY BE BUILT OFF SITE AND LIFTED INTO PLACE OR CONSTRUCTED IN PLACE USING SPECIAL TRAVELING SUPPORTS.
WITH AS BALANCED CANTILEVER THE SPAN IS BALANCED BY CANTILEVERS GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. IF THESE ARE ANCHORED INTO SOLID FOUNDATIONS THEY ARE CALLED ANCHOR ARMS. IN A BRIDGE BUILT ON TWO FOUNDATION PIERS THERE ARE FOUR CANTILEVER ARMS TWO WHICH SPAN THE OBSTACLE AND TWO ANCHOR ARMS WHICH EXTEND AWAY FROM THE OBSTACLE. BECAUSE OF THE NEED FOR MORE STRENGTH AT THE BALANCED CANTILEVER S SUPPORTS THE BRIDGE SUPERSTRUCTURE OFTEN TAKES THE FORM OF TOWERS ABOVE THE FOUNDATION PIERS. THE COMMODORE BARRY BRIDGE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF CANTILEVER BRIDGE.
STEEL TRUSS CANTILEVERS SUPPORT LOADS BY TENSION OF THE UPPER MEMBERS AND COMPRESSION OF THE LOWER ONES. COMMONLY THE STRUCTURE DISTRIBUTES THE TENSION THROUGH THE ANCHOR ARMS TO THE OUTERMOST SUPPORTS WHILE THE COMPRESSION IS CARRIED TO THE FOUNDATIONS BENEATH THE CENTRAL TOWERS.
PRESTRESSED CONCRETE BALANCED CANTILEVER BRIDGES ARE OFTEN BUILT USING SEGMENTAL CONSTRUCTION.
SOME STEEL ARCH BRIDGES SUCH AS THE NAVAJO BRIDGE ARE BUILT USING PURE CANTILEVER SPANS FROM EACH SIDE. THESE ARE THEN JOINED WITH A PIN USUALLY AFTER FORCING THE MEETING POINT APART. WHEN THE JACKS ARE REMOVED AND THE BRIDGE DECKING IS ADDED THE BRIDGE BECOMES A TRUSS ARCH BRIDGE. SUCH UNSUPPORTED CONSTRUCTION IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF SUITABLE ROCK IS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THE TENSION IN THE UPPER CHORD OF THE SPAN DURING CONSTRUCTION USUALLY LIMITING THIS METHOD TO THE SPANNING OF NARROW CANYONS.
WORLD S LONGEST CANTILEVER BRIDGES BY LONGEST SPAN 
CAPITALISM
CAPITALISM IS AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM. IN IT THE GOVERNMENT PLAYS A SECONDARY ROLE. PEOPLE AND COMPANIES MAKE MOST OF THE DECISIONS AND OWN MOST OF THE PROPERTY. GOODS ARE USUALLY MADE BY COMPANIES AND SOLD FOR PROFIT. THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION ARE LARGELY OR ENTIRELY PRIVATELY OWNED BY INDIVIDUALS OR COMPANIES AND OPERATED FOR PROFIT.
MOST PROPERTY FOR EXAMPLE IS OWNED BY PEOPLE OR COMPANIES NOT BY THE GOVERNMENT. CAPITALISM HAS A MORE OR LESS FREE MARKET ECONOMY WHICH MEANS THAT PRICES MOVE UP OR DOWN ACCORDING TO THE AVAILABILITY OF THE PRODUCTS. PEOPLE BUY AND SELL THINGS ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN JUDGMENT. IN MOST COUNTRIES THERE IS SOME REGULATION TRADE LAWS AND SOME PLANNING DONE BY THE GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE SOMETIMES CALLED MIXED ECONOMIES TO INDICATE THIS. SOME PEOPLE DISAGREE ON WHETHER CAPITALISM IS A GOOD IDEA OR HOW MUCH OF CAPITALISM IS A GOOD IDEA.
THE WORD COMES FROM CAPITAL MEANING SOMETHING OF VALUE. THIS CAN BE MONEY FINANCIAL CAPITAL OR ANY OTHER GOODS THAT CAN BE TRADED. THE WORD CAPITAL ORIGINALLY COMES FROM THE LATIN WORD C APUT MEANING HEAD. IT WAS USED TO MEAN HOW MANY HEAD OF CATTLE A RICH PERSON OWNED IN DAYS LONG AGO WHEN CATTLE WERE USED AS MONEY. IN FACT THE WORDS CAPITAL AND CATTLE BOTH COME FROM C APUT.
THE PHILOSOPHER ADAM SMITH S BOOK THE WEALTH OF NATIONS WAS AN IMPORTANT BOOK THAT DEVELOPED THE IDEAS OF CAPITALISM AND THE FREE MARKET. THE WORD CAPITALISM WAS NOT USED UNTIL THE 19TH CENTURY. THE GREATEST INVENTION OF CAPITALISM IS OFTEN SAID TO BE THE JOINT STOCK COMPANY. A JOINT STOCK COMPANY IS A BUSINESS WHERE DIFFERENT STOCKS CAN BE BOUGHT AND OWNED BY SHAREHOLDERS. EACH SHAREHOLDER OWNS COMPANY STOCK IN PROPORTION TO THE NUMBER OF THEIR SHARES.
IN CAPITALISM PEOPLE MAY SELL OR LEND THEIR PROPERTY AND OTHER PEOPLE MAY BUY OR BORROW IT. IF ONE PERSON WANTS TO BUY AND ANOTHER PERSON WANTS TO SELL TO THEM THEY DO NOT NEED TO GET PERMISSION FROM HIGHER POWER. PEOPLE CAN HAVE A MARKET BUYING AND SELLING WITH EACH OTHER WITHOUT ANYONE ELSE TELLING THEM TO. PEOPLE WHO OWN CAPITAL ARE SOMETIMES CALLED CAPITALISTS PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT CAPITALISM ARE CALLED CAPITALISTS TOO. THEY CAN HIRE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO WORK IN THEIR FACTORIES SHOPS OR LANDS FOR THEM FOR THE PAY THEY OFFER.
THE WORD CAPITAL CAN BE USED TO MEAN THINGS THAT PRODUCE MORE THINGS OR MONEY. FOR EXAMPLE LANDS FACTORIES SHOPS TOOLS AND MACHINES ARE CAPITAL. IF SOMEONE HAS MONEY THAT CAN BE INVESTED THAT MONEY IS CAPITAL TOO.
IN CAPITALIST SYSTEMS MANY PEOPLE ARE WORKERS OR PROLETARIANS. THEY ARE EMPLOYED TO EARN MONEY FOR LIVING. PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE TO WORK FOR ANYONE WHO WILL HIRE THEM IN A FREE MARKET.
THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM MANY OLDER ECONOMIC SYSTEMS. IN FEUDALISM MOST PEOPLE WERE SERFS AND HAD TO WORK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO OWNED THE LAND THEY LIVED ON. IN MERCANTILISM THE GOVERNMENT MAKES IT HARD TO BUY THINGS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. IN MANY COUNTRIES WITH MIXED ECONOMIES PART CAPITALISM AND PART SOCIALISM THERE ARE LAWS ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN BUY OR SELL OR WHAT PRICES YOU CAN CHARGE OR WHOM YOU CAN HIRE OR FIRE.
AN INVESTMENT IS WHEN PEOPLE INVEST GIVE THEIR MONEY IN THINGS. PEOPLE CAN PUT THEIR MONEY TOGETHER TO BUY OR BUILD THINGS EVEN IF THEY ARE TOO BIG FOR ONE PERSON TO MAKE ALONE. THE PEOPLE WHO INVEST GET TO BE THE OWNERS OF WHAT THEY BUY OR BUILD TOGETHER. THE STOCK MARKET LETS PEOPLE BUY AND SELL INVESTMENTS.
INVESTING IS IMPORTANT TO CAPITALISM. THE WORD CAPITALIST CAN MEAN TWO THINGS IT CAN MEAN SOMEONE WHO LIKES CAPITALISM BUT IT CAN ALSO MEAN SOMEONE WHO INVESTS. FOR EXAMPLE A VENTURE CAPITALIST INVESTS IN NEW BUSINESSES.
PEOPLE WHO START BUSINESSES OR INVEST IN BUSINESSES CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. A BUSINESS SELLS THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANT. THE INVESTORS MAKE EXTRA MONEY WHICH IS CALLED PROFIT. INVESTORS CAN TAKE THEIR PROFIT AND INVEST IT IN MORE BUSINESSES OR IN MAKING THE BUSINESS BIGGER. THE INVESTORS CAN GET MORE AND MORE PROFIT IF THE BUSINESSES ARE SUCCESSFUL.
SOCIALISTS AND COMMUNISTS ARE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SUPPORT CAPITALISM. THEY SAY IT HURTS WORKERS BECAUSE BUSINESSES MAKE MORE MONEY BY SELLING THINGS THAN THEY PAY THE WORKERS WHO MAKE THE THINGS. BUSINESS OWNERS BECOME RICH WHILE WORKERS REMAIN POOR AND EXPLOITED TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. THEY ALSO ARGUE SOCIETY WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT IF PEOPLE THOUGHT LESS ABOUT COMPETING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER FOR THEIR OWN INTERESTS AND THOUGHT MORE OF WORKING TOGETHER FOR THE OVERALL GOOD OF SOCIETY. ANOTHER ARGUMENT IS THAT EACH PERSON HAS A RIGHT TO BASIC NEEDS SUCH AS FOOD AND SHELTER. WITHIN CAPITALISM SOMETIMES PEOPLE MIGHT NOT GET EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO LIVE.
KARL MARX WAS A FAMOUS COMMUNIST PHILOSOPHER FROM GERMANY. HE WROTE A FAMOUS BOOK CALLED THE CAPITAL OR DAS KAPITAL IN GERMAN. HE SAID THAT CAPITALISM WOULD GO AWAY AFTER WORKERS DECIDED TO TAKE OVER THE GOVERNMENT IN A REVOLUTION. THERE WERE VIOLENT COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONS IN MANY COUNTRIES. MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS. BUT CAPITALISM DID NOT GO AWAY AND MOST OF THESE COMMUNIST SYSTEMS HAVE COLLAPSED AND DO NOT EXIST TODAY OR ELSE THEY HAVE BECOME MORE CAPITALIST. SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT COMMUNISM IN THOSE COUNTRIES DID NOT WORK BECAUSE MARX S IDEAS THOUGH NICE IN THOUGHT DID NOT REALLY WORK. OTHERS THINK THAT COMMUNIST COUNTRIES COLLAPSED BECAUSE OF THE ATTACKS MILITARY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FROM CAPITALIST COUNTRIES.
ANARCHISTS THAT ARE NOT ANARCHO CAPITALISTS DO NOT SUPPORT CAPITALISM EITHER. THEY DO NOT THINK WORKERS SHOULD TAKE THE GOVERNMENT BUT THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO GOVERNMENT AT ALL. THEY THINK THAT COMMUNISM FAILED BECAUSE THE COMMUNISTS SET UP DICTATORSHIPS THAT SAID THAT THEY WOULD RULE IN THE NAME OF WORKERS INSTEAD OF LETTING WORKERS ORGANIZE THEMSELVES FREELY.
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WORDS FOR PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT CAPITALISM. IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD THESE PEOPLE ARE CALLED EITHER CONSERVATIVES OR LIBERALS ESPECIALLY MARKET LIBERALS. IN THE UNITED STATES THE WORD LIBERAL CAN MEAN SOMEONE WHOSE BELIEFS LEAN TOWARD SOCIALISM WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES MIGHT CALL A SOCIAL LIBERAL. LIBERTARIAN IS A WORD THAT IN AMERICA AND SOME OTHER COUNTRIES MEANS SOMEONE WHO WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE LITTLE OR NO POWER TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO BUY OR SELL.
THE REASONS FOR CAPITALISM ARE NOT JUST ECONOMIC. THEY ARE POLITICAL. THEY BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF THE ECONOMY LEADS TO LOSS OF LIBERTY BY THE CITIZEN. THE ARGUMENT WAS PUT BEST BY FRIEDRICH HAYEK WHO CONNECTED THE OPEN SOCIETY WITH RESPECT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND TOLERANCE FOR THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEOPLE.
PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT CAPITALISM ALSO HAVE DISAGREEMENTS. MOST PEOPLE AGREE THAT CAPITALISM WORKS BETTER IF THE GOVERNMENT KEEPS PEOPLE FROM STEALING OTHER PEOPLE S THINGS. IF PEOPLE COULD STEAL ANYTHING THEN NOBODY WOULD WANT TO BUY ANYTHING.
IN MOST COUNTRIES THE GOVERNMENT DOES MORE THAN THAT. IT TRIES TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE BUY AND SELL FAIRLY AND THAT EMPLOYMENT IS FAIR. BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TAKES A LOT OF MONEY IN TAXES IT ALSO BUYS A LOT OF THINGS AND GIVES A LOT OF MONEY AWAY. IT SPENDS MONEY ON GUNS AND SHIPS FOR THE MILITARY ON SCIENCE RESEARCH IN UNIVERSITIES AND ON SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES. IT ALSO GIVES MONEY TO PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE JOBS AND TO BUSINESSES THAT THE POLITICAL LEADERS THINK ARE IMPORTANT. WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS IN CHARGE OF PART OF THE ECONOMY THIS IS CALLED A MIXED ECONOMY. HOWEVER WHEN THE GOVERNMENT USES PEOPLE S TAXES IT CAUSES ARGUMENTS AS PEOPLE COMPARE IT TO SOCIALISM.
A FEW PEOPLE THINK THAT PEOPLE CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY GOVERNMENT. INSTEAD OF HAVING LAWS AGAINST STEALING PEOPLE COULD PROTECT THEIR OWN THINGS OR AGREE TO PAY OTHER PEOPLE SUCH AS ARBITRATORS INSURERS AND PRIVATE DEFENDERS TO PROTECT THEM. THIS BELIEF IS CALLED ANARCHO CAPITALISM. THESE PEOPLE THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY THEIR EARNINGS BECAUSE IT TAKES TAXES AWAY FROM PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR WILL AND KEEPS THEM FROM MAKING AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THEMSELVES.
CAPSICUM
CAPSICUM IS A GENUS OF PLANTS FROM THE NIGHTSHADE FAMILY SOLANACEAE. SOME OF THESE PLANTS ARE USED AS SPICES VEGETABLES OR DRUGS. THE FRUIT OF CAPSICUM PLANTS HAVE A VARIETY OF NAMES. THE NAMES VARY DEPENDING ON PLACE AND TYPE. THEY ARE COMMONLY CALLED CHILI PEPPER RED OR GREEN PEPPER OR JUST PEPPER IN BRITAIN AND THE US THE LARGE MILD FORM IS CALLED BELL PEPPER IN THE US CAPSICUM IN AUSTRALIAN ENGLISH AND INDIAN ENGLISH AND PAPRIKA IN SOME OTHER COUNTRIES ALTHOUGH PAPRIKA CAN ALSO REFER TO THE POWDERED SPICE MADE FROM VARIOUS CAPSICUM FRUIT.
CAPSICUMS ORIGINATED IN THE AMERICAS BUT ARE NOW GROWN WORLDWIDE.
THE FRUIT OF MOST SPECIES OF CAPSICUM CONTAINS CAPSAICIN. CAPSAICIN IS A CHEMICAL THAT CAN PRODUCE A STRONG BURNING SENSATION IN THE MOUTH AND IF NOT PROPERLY DIGESTED ANUS OF THE UNACCUSTOMED EATER. MOST MAMMALS FIND THIS UNPLEASANT HOWEVER BIRDS ARE UNAFFECTED. THE PLANTS DEVELOPED THE SECRETION OF CAPSAICIN TO PROTECT THE FRUIT FROM BEING EATEN BY MAMMALS. AT THE SAME TIME THE BRIGHT COLORS ATTRACT BIRDS. THESE BIRDS WILL SPREAD THE SEEDS. THE AMOUNT OF CAPSAICIN IN PEPPERS IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AND DEPENDENT ON GENETICS. THIS MEANS THAT ALMOST ALL TYPES OF PEPPERS HAVE VARIED AMOUNTS OF HEAT FELT BY THOSE CONSUMING THEM. THE ONLY PEPPER WITHOUT CAPSAICIN IS THE BELL PEPPER. CHILI PEPPERS ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN NATIVE AMERICAN MEDICINE. CAPSAICIN IS ALSO USED IN MODERN WESTERN MEDICINE TO STIMULATE BLOOD CIRCULATION OR TO RELIEVE PAIN.
BLACK PEPPER AND SICHUAN PEPPER CAUSE SIMILAR BURNING SENSATIONS. THESE ARE CAUSED THEY BY DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES THOUGH PIPERINE AND HYDROXY ALPHA SANSHOOL RESPECTIVELY.
CAPSICUM FRUITS AND PEPPERS CAN BE EATEN RAW OR COOKED. THOSE USED IN COOKING ARE GENERALLY VARIETIES OF THE C. ANNUL AND C. PUBESCENS SPECIES THOUGH A FEW OTHERS ARE USED AS WELL. THEY ARE SUITABLE FOR STUFFING WITH FILLINGS SUCH AS CHEESE MEAT OR RICE.
THEY ARE ALSO FREQUENTLY USED BOTH CHOPPED AND RAW IN SALADS OR COOKED IN STIR FRIES OR OTHER MIXED DISHES. THEY CAN BE SLICED INTO STRIPS AND FRIED ROASTED WHOLE OR IN PIECES OR CHOPPED AND INCORPORATED INTO SALSAS OR OTHER SAUCES.
THEY CAN BE PRESERVED BY DRYING OR PICKLING. DRIED PEPPERS MAY BE RECONSTITUTED WHOLE OR PROCESSED INTO FLAKES OR POWDERS. PICKLED OR MARINATED PEPPERS ARE FREQUENTLY ADDED TO SANDWICHES OR SALADS. EXTRACTS CAN BE MADE AND INCORPORATED INTO HOT SAUCES.
IN 2005 A POLL OF 2 000 PEOPLE REVEALED PEPPERS TO BE BRITAIN S 4TH FAVORITE CULINARY VEGETABLE.
MANY VARIETIES OF THE SAME SPECIES CAN BE USED IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS FOR EXAMPLE C. ANNUAL INCLUDES THE BELL PEPPER VARIETY WHICH IS SOLD IN BOTH ITS IMMATURE GREEN STATE AND ITS RED YELLOW OR ORANGE RIPE STATE.
THIS SAME SPECIES HAS OTHER VARIETIES AS WELL SUCH AS THE ANAHEIM CHILLY OFTEN USED FOR STUFFING THE DRIED ANCHO CHILLY USED TO MAKE CHILI POWDER THE MILD TO HOT JALAPE O AND THE SMOKED RIPE JALAPE O KNOWN AS A CHIPOTLE.
MOST OF THE CAPSAICIN IN A PEPPER IS FOUND IN THE INTERIOR RIBS THAT DIVIDE THE CHAMBERS OF THE FRUIT AND TO WHICH THE SEEDS ARE ATTACHED. AT THE STEM END OF THE POD GLANDS SECRETE THE CAPSAICIN WHICH THEN SPREADS THROUGHOUT BUT IS CONCENTRATED ON THE RIBS AND SEEDS. THE AMOUNT VARIES VERY SIGNIFICANTLY BY VARIETY AND IS MEASURED IN SCOVILLE HEAT UNITS SHU RANGING FROM THE MILD BELL PEPPER TO THE SCORCHING HABANERO CHILE.
THE NAME GIVEN TO THE FRUITS VARIES BETWEEN ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES.
IN AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND AND INDIA HEATLESS SPECIES ARE CALLED CAPSICUMS WHILE HOT ONES ARE CALLED CHILLI CHILLIES DOUBLE L. THE TERM BELL PEPPERS IS RARELY USED USUALLY IN REFERENCE TO C. ANNUUM AND OTHER VARIETIES WHICH LOOK LIKE A CAPSICUM OR BELL BUT ARE FAIRLY HOT.
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IRELAND AND CANADA THE HEATLESS VARIETIES ARE CALLED PEPPERS SWEET PEPPERS OR CAPSICUMS OR GREEN PEPPERS RED PEPPERS ETC. WHILE THE HOT ONES ARE CHILLI CHILLIES DOUBLE L OR CHILLI PEPPERS.
IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA THE COMMON HEATLESS SPECIES IS REFERRED TO AS BELL PEPPERS SWEET PEPPERS RED GREEN ETC PEPPERS OR SIMPLY PEPPERS WHILE THE HOT SPECIES ARE COLLECTIVELY CALLED CHILE CHILES CHILI CHILIES OR CHILI CHILE PEPPERS ONE L ONLY HOT PEPPERS OR NAMED AS A SPECIFIC VARIETY E.G. BANANA PEPPER. IN MANY MIDWESTERN REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES THE SWEET BELL PEPPER IS COMMONLY CALLED A MANGO. WITH THE MODERN ADVENT OF FRESH TROPICAL FRUIT IMPORTERS EXPOSING A WIDER LATITUDE OF INDIVIDUALS TO THE TROPICAL FRUIT VARIETY OF THE MANGO THIS DEFINITION IS BECOMING ARCHAIC. HOWEVER MANY MENUS STILL CALL A STUFFED BELL PEPPER A MANGO.
THE NAME PEPPER CAME INTO USE BECAUSE THE PLANTS WERE HOT IN THE SAME SENSE AS THE CONDIMENT BLACK PEPPER PIPER NIGRUM. BUT THERE IS NO BOTANICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS PLANT NOR WITH SICHUAN PEPPER.
IN SPANISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT NAMES FOR EACH VARIETY AND PREPARATION. IN MEXICO THE TERM CHILE IS USED. SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHILE WHOSE NAME IS UNRELATED PER AND ARGENTINA USE AJ. IN SPAIN HEATLESS VARIETIES ARE CALLED PIMIENTO AND HOT VARIETIES GUINDILLA.
IN INDIAN ENGLISH THE WORD CAPSICUM IS USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR BELL PEPPER. ALL OTHER VARIETIES OF CHILI PEPPERS ARE CALLED CHILI. IN NORTHERN INDIA AND PAKISTAN BELL PEPPER IS ALSO COMMONLY CALLED SHIMLA MIRCH IN THE NATIVE LANGUAGES. SHIMLA INCIDENTALLY IS A POPULAR HILL STATION IN INDIA AND MIRCH MEANS CHILI IN NATIVE LANGUAGES.
IN POLISH THE WORD PAPRYKA IS USED FOR CAPSISCUM FRUIT AND DRY SPICE THE WORD PIEPRZ IS USED FOR BLACK RED AND GREEN PEPPER BUT NOT FOR CAPSISUM FRUIT OR SPICE.
IN HUNGARIAN THE WORD PAPRIKA IS USED FOR CAPSICUM FRUIT AND DRY SPICE.
IN ISRAEL CAPSICUM IS COMMONLY CALLED PILPEL MEANING PEPPER IN HEBREW.
YOU CAN TEST HOW HOT A HOT PEPPER CAN BE BY USING THE SCOVILLE SCALE.
CAPSICUM IS EXCELLENT SOURCE OF LAXATIVE PURGATIVE AND PAIN RELIEF. CAPSAICIN HAS ALSO BEEN STUDIED FOR POSSIBLE PROSTATE CANCER FIGHTING EFFECTS.
CAR
A CAR IS A ROAD VEHICLE USED TO CARRY PASSENGERS. IT IS ALSO CALLED AN AUTOMOBILE WHICH COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD AUTO AND THE FRENCH WORD MOBILE. THIS NAME MEANS SELF MOVING AS CARS DO NOT NEED HORSES OR OTHER EXTERNAL SOURCES OF POWER TO MOVE. CARS USUALLY HAVE FOUR WHEELS AND GET THEIR POWER FROM AN ENGINE. MILLIONS OF CARS WERE MADE DURING THE 20TH CENTURY.
LIKE OTHER VEHICLES CARS ARE MADE IN DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES FOR PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT NEEDS. SOME SMALL CITY CARS CARRY ONLY TWO TO FOUR PEOPLE WITH ONLY SMALL SPACE FOR LUGGAGE. OTHER TYPES ARE ABLE TO CARRY MANY PASSENGERS OR HEAVY LOADS. FOR EXAMPLE STATION WAGONS OR ESTATE CARS CARRY FROM 5 TO 9 PEOPLE OR FEWER PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF LUGGAGE. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF VANS SUCH AS MINIVANS WHICH ARE MADE FOR FAMILIES AND EVEN SMALL PICKUP TRUCKS WHICH ARE CAR LIKE VEHICLES MADE FOR CARRYING MEDIUM SIZED LOADS FOR EXAMPLE GOODS FOR DELIVERY OR PLUMBER S AND BUILDER S TOOLS AND MATERIALS. HEAVY LORRIES ARE USED TO CARRY DELIVERIES AND HEAVY LOADS.
IN ORDER FOR A CAR TO WORK IT MUST HAVE A POWER SOURCE WHERE THE CAR GETS THE ENERGY IT NEEDS TO TURN THE WHEELS. MOST CARS USE SOME KIND OF FUEL TO MAKE AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE RUN. THE POWER FROM THE ENGINE THEN GOES TO THE WHEELS THROUGH A TRANSMISSION WHICH HAS A SET OF GEARS THAT MAKES THE CAR GO FASTER OR SLOWER. THE MOST COMMON FUEL IN SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE CARS IS PETROL WHICH IS CALLED GASOLINE IN AMERICA PEOPLE JUST CALL IT GAS THOUGH. SOME LARGER MORE EXPENSIVE CARS BURN DIESEL FUEL WHICH IS USED IN BIG TRUCKS AND BUSES AND A FEW USE WOOD GAS. IN SOME COUNTRIES SUCH AS BRAZIL AND SWEDEN A MIXTURE OF ETHANOL AND PETROL CALLED GASOHOL IN BRAZIL AND E 85 IN SWEDEN IS USED AS AUTOMOBILE FUEL. THERE ARE CARS DESIGNED TO RUN ON MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF FUEL THESE ARE CALLED FLEX FUEL AND ARE VERY RARE.
ALL OF THESE TYPES OF FUEL ARE CALLED FOSSIL FUELS BECAUSE THEY COME FROM FOSSILS THAT WERE MADE MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO. OVER TIME THEY TURN INTO OIL WHICH IS THEN DRILLED UP FROM DEEP INSIDE THE EARTH AND THEN TURNED INTO FUEL BY CHEMICAL CHANGES. BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY CARS AROUND US TODAY THERE WILL BE ONE DAY WHEN THERE IS NO MORE OIL LEFT IN THE GROUND. WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE ANY MORE FUEL TO RUN OUR CARS. THIS IS WHY FOSSIL FUELS ARE NON RENEWABLE RESOURCES. ALSO BURNING FUEL IN AN ENGINE PRODUCES A LOT OF EXHAUST WHICH CAN GO UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND CAUSE GLOBAL WARMING. THIS IS ALSO GOING TO BE A PROBLEM IN THE COMING YEARS.
TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS ARE COMING UP WITH ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES WHICH USE FUELS THAT ARE LESS COMMON BUT ARE RENEWABLE AND WILL NEVER RUN OUT. THEY INCLUDE PROPANE NATURAL GAS COMPRESSED AIR AND ETHANOL WHICH COMES FROM PLANTS. MORE RECENTLY THERE ARE CARS THAT RUN ON ELECTRICITY. THESE CAN COME IN DIFFERENT TYPES. THEY MAY STORE ELECTRICITY IN A BATTERY AS IN THE NISSAN LEAF OR GENERATE IT FROM HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS LIKE THE HONDA CLARITY. THE ELECTRICITY THEN DRIVES AN ELECTRIC MOTOR INSTEAD OF AN ENGINE WHICH THEN TURNS THE WHEELS. THESE CARS ARE MUCH QUIETER THAN OTHER CARS AND DO NOT GIVE OUT ANY POLLUTING EXHAUST GASSES ALTHOUGH SOME ECOLOGISTS SAY THAT MOST OF THE HYDROGEN THAT PEOPLE USE COMES FROM BURNING FOSSIL FUELS. CARS THAT USE BATTERIES CAN BE RECHARGED IN DIFFERENT WAYS USUALLY FROM A POWER OUTLET BUT SOME EVEN USE SOLAR CELLS. THERE IS A COMPETITION EVERY YEAR WHERE PEOPLE TRY TO DESIGN A CAR THAT CAN LAST THE LONGEST AND GO THE FARTHEST ON SOLAR ENERGY ALONE.
THERE IS ALSO A TYPE OF CAR THAT USES BOTH AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE AND AN ELECTRIC MOTOR. THIS IS CALLED A HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND AN EXAMPLE IS THE TOYOTA PRIUS.
THE EARLIEST AUTOMOBILES RECORDED WERE ACTUALLY STEAM ENGINES ATTACHED TO WAGONS IN THE LATE 18TH CENTURY. THE STEAM ENGINES WERE HEAVY AND THEREFORE THE WAGON WAS SLOW AND HARD TO CONTROL. BETTER AND FASTER STEAM CARS BECAME COMMON LATE IN THE 19TH CENTURY.
SOME CARS IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY WERE POWERED BY ELECTRICITY. THEY WERE SLOW AND HEAVY AND WENT OUT OF USE UNTIL THE IDEA CAME BACK LATER IN THE CENTURY.
THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE CHANGED THE WAY AUTOMOBILES WERE POWERED. THE ENGINE USED EITHER GASOLINE DIESEL OR KEROSENE TO WORK. WHEN THE GAS IS EXPLODED IN A CYLINDER IT PUSHES THE PISTON DOWN AND TURNS THE WHEEL.
ALTHOUGH MANY PEOPLE TRIED TO MAKE A GOOD CAR THAT WOULD WORK WELL AND SELL WELL PEOPLE SAY THAT KARL BENZ INVENTED THE MODERN AUTOMOBILE. HE USED A FOUR STROKE TYPE OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE TO POWER HIS BENZ PATENT MOTORWAGEN. IN 1886. HE BEGAN TO MAKE MANY CARS IN A FACTORY AND SELL THEM IN GERMANY IN 1888.
IN NORTH AMERICA THE FIRST MODERN CAR WAS MADE BY THE DURYEA BROTHERS IN SPRINGFIELD MASSACHUSETTS. THE DURYEA BROTHERS CAR ALSO WON THE FIRST EVER CAR RACE IN 1895 COMPETING AGAINST CARS MADE BY BENZ. THE RACE WAS IN CHICAGO ILLINOIS AND 53 MILES LONG. DURYEA THEN BEGAN MAKING THE FIRST AUTOMOBILES FOR EVERYDAY PEOPLE TO USE IN 1896. THAT YEAR THEY MADE 13 CARS BY HAND IN SPRINGFIELD MASSACHUSETTS.
BENZ MAY HAVE INVENTED THE FIRST MODERN CAR AND DURYEA THE FIRST CAR TO SELL BUT HENRY FORD SOLD THE MOST CARS TO THE MOST PEOPLE. IN 1910 HE BEGAN MAKING AND SELLING HIS MODEL T WHICH WAS A HUGE SUCCESS. MANY PEOPLE COULD AFFORD THIS CAR NOT JUST THE RICH BECAUSE FORD USED MASS PRODUCTION. THIS MEANT HE MADE A GREAT MANY MODEL TS IN A SHORT TIME IN A FACTORY. PEOPLE SAY THAT THE MODEL T IS THE CAR THAT PUT AMERICA ON WHEELS. THE MODEL T WAS THE MOST POPULAR CAR OF THE TIME BECAUSE IT WAS CHEAP BUT IT WAS STILL A GOOD QUALITY CAR THAT ORDINARY PEOPLE COULD OWN.
SINCE THEN MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF CARS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT FROM MINIVANS TO SPORTS CARS.
IN THE 1950S THE UNITED STATES MADE AND USED MORE CARS THAN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD. THE WORLD CAUGHT UP AND FIFTY YEARS LATER CHINA BECAME THE LARGEST MAKER AND USER.
CARS ARE FASTER THAN WALKING OR RIDING A BIKE IF YOU ARE GOING A LONG WAY. THEY CAN CARRY MORE THAN ONE PERSON AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF LUGGAGE. DEPENDING ON LOCAL PUBLIC TRANSPORT QUALITY THEY CAN ALSO BE FASTER AND FAR MORE CONVENIENT THAN USING BUSES BICYCLES OR TRAINS AND CAN OFTEN GO WHERE PUBLIC TRANSPORT CANNOT. 4 WHEEL DRIVE OFF ROAD VEHICLES ARE PARTICULARLY GOOD AT REACHING PLACES DIFFICULT FOR OTHER WHEELED TRANSPORT DUE TO BAD ROADS OR HARSH TERRAIN. THEY COST MORE AND BURN MORE FUEL AND THERE ARE MANY PLACES EVEN THEY CANNOT GO.
MOST CARS ENCLOSE PEOPLE AND CARGO IN A STEEL CAGE HAVING A ROOF DOORS AND WINDOWS THUS GIVING PROTECTION FROM WEATHER. MODERN CARS GIVE FURTHER PROTECTION IN CASE OF ROAD ACCIDENT AS THEY HAVE ADDED SAFETY FEATURES SUCH AS SEAT BELTS AIRBAGS CRUMPLE ZONES AND SIDE IMPACT PROTECTION THAT WOULD BE EXPENSIVE OR IMPOSSIBLE ON TWO WHEELED OR LIGHT 3 WHEELED VEHICLES OR MOST BUSES.
WITH REGULAR CHECK UPS AND CAR SERVICING CARS CAN LAST A VERY LONG TIME. IN SOME COUNTRIES LIKE AUSTRALIA YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR CAR CHECKED BY AUTHORISED MECHANICS REGULARLY BY LAW TO CONFIRM THAT YOUR CAR IS SAFE TO DRIVE. YOU CAN GO INTO A CAR MECHANIC TO GET YOUR CAR CHECKED OR HAVE A MOBILE MECHANIC COME TO YOU TO REPAIR YOUR CAR.
BUYING AND RUNNING A CAR NEEDS A LOT OF MONEY EVEN MORE FOR A GOOD QUALITY ONE THAT IS NOT TOO OLD. THERE ARE THINGS TO PAY FOR THE CAR ITSELF FUEL PARTS FOR EXAMPLE TIRES TYRES MAINTENANCE REPAIRS INSURANCE TO COVER THE COST OF CRASHES OR THEFT PARKING CHARGES AND TOLL ROADS AND ANY TAX OR LICENSING FEES CHARGED BY GOVERNMENT.
WHEN CARS CRASH THEY CAN BE DAMAGED AND HURT PEOPLE AND LIFE OF A PERSON IS MORE IMPORTANT. WHEN TOO MANY CARS TRY TO GO THE SAME WAY TRAFFIC CONGESTION SLOWS THEM ALL. THEY CAN CAUSE AIR POLLUTION IF TOO MANY ARE USED IN A SMALL AREA LIKE A CITY AND THE COMBINED POLLUTION OF THE WORLD S CARS IS THOUGHT TO BE PARTLY TO BLAME FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. MANY PLACES WHERE PEOPLE LIVE CLOSE TOGETHER HAVE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OR MASS TRANSIT SUCH AS BUSES TRAINS TRAMS AND SUBWAYS. THESE CAN HELP PEOPLE GO MORE QUICKLY AND CHEAPLY THAN BY CAR WHEN TRAFFIC JAMS ARE A PROBLEM. SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE MADE SMALLER FOR EXAMPLE BY CARPOOLING WHICH IS PUTTING MANY PEOPLE TOGETHER IN ONE CAR.
TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND ACCIDENTS CAN BE DANGEROUS TO OTHER ROAD USERS FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE RIDING BICYCLES OR WALKING ESPECIALLY IN AN OLD TOWN BUILT WHEN CARS WERE FEW. SOME 20TH CENTURY TOWNS ARE DESIGNED FOR CARS AS THE MAIN TRANSPORT. THIS CAN CAUSE OTHER PROBLEMS SUCH AS EVEN MORE POLLUTION AND TRAFFIC AS EVERYONE HAS TO DRIVE. COMMUNITIES ARE DIVIDED UP AND SEPARATED WITH BIG ROADS. PEDESTRIANS ARE IN DANGER WHERE THERE ARE TOO FEW FOOT BRIDGES SMALL ROAD BRIDGES OR OTHER CROSSINGS. 
CATHOLICISM
CATHOLICISM IS THE TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS OF CATHOLIC CHURCHES. IT REFERS TO THEIR THEOLOGY LITURGY ETHICS AND SPIRITUALITY. THE TERM USUALLY REFERS TO CHURCHES BOTH WESTERN AND EASTERN THAT ARE IN FULL COMMUNION WITH THE HOLY SEE. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS THE MAIN AND EARLIEST FORM OF CHRISTIANITY.
IN 2012 THERE WERE MORE THAN 1.1 BILLION CATHOLICS WORLDWIDE. THIS MAKES UP MORE THAN 17 OF THE WORLD POPULATION.
THE WORD CATHOLICISM COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD CATHOLIKISMOS. THIS MEANS ACCORDING TO THE WHOLE.
THE WORD CATHOLICISM REFERS TO MANY THINGS INCLUDING ITS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS CALLED THEOLOGIES AND DOCTRINES AND ITS FORM OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP CALLED LITURGIES. THE WORD ALSO REFERS TO CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ABOUT ETHICS THINGS THAT ARE RIGHT AND WRONG. IT ALSO REFERS TO THE WAYS THAT MEMBERS OF THE CATHOLIC RELIGION LIVE AND PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION.
MANY PEOPLE USE THE WORD CATHOLICISM TO TALK ABOUT RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WHOSE LEADER IS CALLED THE BISHOP OF ROME AND OFTEN CALLED THE POPE. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS BASED IN THE VATICAN CITY A SMALL INDEPENDENT COUNTRY IN THE CITY OF ROME ITALY. SOMETIMES THE WORD ALSO REFERS TO BELIEFS OF OTHER CHRISTIAN CHURCHES INCLUDING THE EASTERN ORTHODOX CHURCHES WHO HAVE MANY BELIEFS SIMILAR TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BUT DO NOT BELIEVE THE BISHOP OF ROME IS THEIR LEADER.
THE WORD CATHOLICISM IS OFTEN USED TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BELIEFS OF CATHOLIC CHRISTIANS AND THE BELIEFS OF OTHERS CALLED PROTESTANT CHRISTIANS. CATHOLIC AND ORTHODOX CHURCHES USE CHURCH LEADERS CALLED BISHOPS TO DETERMINE BELIEFS. PROTESTANTS HOWEVER OFTEN USE EACH MEMBER S OWN UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIBLE TO DETERMINE BELIEFS. PROTESTANTS USE GUIDELINES FROM THE 16TH CENTURY PROTESTANT REFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND THE BIBLE. IT IS THE WORLD S SECOND LARGEST RELIGIOUS DENOMINATION AFTER SUNNISM.
THE OLDEST DOCUMENT THAT USES THE NAME CATHOLIC CHURCH IS A LETTER WRITTEN BY A MAN NAMED IGNATIUS. IGNATIUS LIVED IN THE ANCIENT CITY OF ANTIOCH. IN THE YEAR 107 IGNATIUS WROTE A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IN THE ANCIENT CITY OF SMYRNA. IN THIS LETTER IGNATIUS ENCOURAGED THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY TO BE LOYAL TO THEIR LEADER THE BISHOP. IGNATIUS WROTE 
WHEREVER THE BISHOP SHALL APPEAR THERE LET THE MULTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE ALSO BE EVEN AS WHEREVER JESUS CHRIST IS THERE IS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. 
MANY DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS GROUPS OF CHRISTIANS CALL THEMSELVES CATHOLIC. OFTEN THESE GROUPS HAVE SPECIAL BELIEFS ABOUT THEIR LEADERS CALLED BISHOPS. THEY BELIEVE JESUS OF NAZARETH WHOM CHRISTIANS BELIEVE IS THE SON OF GOD APPOINTED THE FIRST BISHOPS WHO APPOINTED FUTURE BISHOPS WHO EVENTUALLY APPOINTED EACH COMMUNITY S CURRENT BISHOPS. THIS APPOINTING OF LEADERS IS CALLED APOSTOLIC SUCCESSION.
THE GROUPS THAT USE THE TERM CATHOLIC TO TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES ARE THE 
NOT ALL COMMUNITIES BELIEVE THAT OTHER COMMUNITIES USE THE TERM CATHOLIC PROPERLY. ALSO NOT ALL COMMUNITIES BELIEVE THAT THE OTHER COMMUNITIES HAVE APOSTOLIC SUCCESSION EITHER. FOR EXAMPLE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BELIEVES THAT THE EASTERN ORTHODOX HAVE APOSTOLIC SUCCESSION. HOWEVER THE CATHOLIC CHURCH DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ANGLICANS OR LUTHERANS HAVE IT.
EASTERN ORTHODOX HAVE SIMILAR BELIEFS ABOUT ANGLICANS AND LUTHERANS. NOT ALL EASTERN ORTHODOX BELIEVE THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS APOSTOLIC SUCCESSION. DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE EASTERN ORTHODOX CHURCHES HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS.
HOWEVER THE ANGLICANS AND LUTHERANS GENERALLY BELIEVE THAT ALL CHRISTIANS ARE PART OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THESE GROUPS HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERM CATHOLIC.
CATHOLICISM WAS STARTED AS A RESULT OF JESUS OF NAZARETH A JEWISH MAN WHOM CHRISTIANS BELIEVE IS THE SON OF GOD A CHRISTIAN BELIEF KNOWN AS THE TRINITY FATHER SON AND HOLY SPIRIT. CATHOLICS BELIEVE JESUS TO BE A DESCENDANT OF DAVID A JEWISH KING FROM A LONG TIME AGO. JESUS WAS EXECUTED KILLED BY THE ROMANS IN THE YEAR 33 AD. CATHOLICS BELIEVE JESUS ROSE FROM THE DEAD AND SPOKE TO HIS FOLLOWERS CALLED THE TWELVE APOSTLES. THEY ALSO BELIEVE THAT JESUS ROSE INTO HEAVEN AND THEN SENT THE HOLY SPIRIT TO GUIDE HIS FOLLOWERS AT AN EVENT KNOWN AS PENTECOST.
ONE OF HIS FOLLOWERS THE APOSTLE NAMED SAINT PETER WAS APPOINTED LEADER BY JESUS AND LATER BECAME RECOGNIZED AS THE FIRST POPE OR BISHOP OF ROME SOON AFTER THAT HE WAS CAPTURED AND DIED IN ROME. CATHOLICS BELIEVE SAINT PETER WAS GIVEN THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN MEANING THAT JESUS MADE HIM AND THE APOSTLES IN CHARGE OF FORGIVING SINS. TODAY THE POPE IS POPE FRANCIS WHO IS THE LEADER OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THE WORD POPE COMES FROM THE LATIN WORD FOR FATHER.
IN 325 THE FIRST COUNCIL OF NICAEA AGREED ON HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CHURCH. THE COUNCIL AGREED THE CHURCH HAD FIVE PATRIARCHS PATRIARCH WAS THE HIGHEST TYPE OF CHURCH LEADER. THE FIVE LEADERS WERE THE ARCHBISHOPS OF ROME THE POPE ALEXANDRIA ANTIOCH CONSTANTINOPLE AND JERUSALEM. THE PATRIARCH OF ROME WAS HONORED AS FIRST AMONG EQUALS. 
IN TIME SEVERAL CHURCHES SPLIT OFF FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BECAUSE OF DIFFERING OPINIONS OF THEOLOGY. THIS CAUSED BREAKS IN THE CHURCH CALLED SCHISMS. MOST SCHISMS HAPPENED BECAUSE PEOPLE HAD DIFFERENT BELIEFS ABOUT WHAT IS TRUE.
IN 451 A CHURCH DIVISION HAPPENED WHEN ALL THE CHURCH LEADERS MEETING AT THE CHURCH COUNCIL IN THE CITY OF CHALCEDON EXCOMMUNICATED CUT OFF THREE LEADERS BECAUSE THEY HELD TO MONOPHYSITISM AND WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE VIEW THAT JESUS HAD TWO NATURES FULLY DIVINE AND FULLY HUMAN. THESE THREE WERE THE BISHOPS OF EGYPT SYRIA AND ARMENIA. OF COURSE THESE THREE BISHOPS DID NOT ACCEPT BEING EXCOMMUNICATED EITHER SO THE CHURCHES UNDER THEM ARE STILL KNOWN TODAY AS ORIENTAL ORTHODOX CHURCHES.
IN 1054 THE CHURCH SPLIT IN TWO IN THE EAST WEST SCHISM. THE CHURCH IN WESTERN EUROPE WHICH FOLLOWED THE POPE BECAME KNOWN AS THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE CHURCHES IN THE REST OF THE WORLD WHICH DID NOT THINK THAT THE POPE SHOULD LEAD ALL CHRISTIANS BECAME KNOWN AS THE ORTHODOX CHURCH ORTHODOX MEANS CORRECT BELIEF AS THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE KEPT THE TEACHINGS OF THE EARLY CHURCH AND THE ROMAN CATHOLICS HAVE NOT.
THE NEXT BIG SPLIT WAS THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION. PROTESTANTS RESISTED THE CENTRAL AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH IN ROME AND REJECTED MANY PRACTICES BELIEFS AND DISCIPLINES. THE REFORMATION STARTED IN GERMANY WHERE MARTIN LUTHER SENT HIS DEMANDS FOR CHANGE TO THE CHURCH. BECAUSE OF POLITICS IN EUROPE MANY NATIONS SUPPORTED LUTHER. THE LUTHERAN CHURCH WAS STARTED. LATER THE CALVINIST OR PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH STARTED.
IN ENGLAND KING HENRY VIII STARTED THE ANGLICAN CHURCH. HE WANTED TO DIVORCE HIS FIRST WIFE BUT THE POPE WOULDN T ALLOW IT. AT FIRST THE CHURCH OF KING HENRY VIII THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE WAS THAT THE KING WAS HEAD OF THE CHURCH INSTEAD OF THE POPE. LATER UNDER HIS SON EDWARD VI THE ANGLICAN CHURCH BECAME MORE REFORMED OR PROTESTANT. ANGLICANS AND SEVERAL OTHER PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS STILL BELIEVE THEY ARE REFORMED CATHOLICS. PURITANISM AROSE AMONG ANGLICANS WHO THOUGHT THE REFORMS DIDN T GO FAR ENOUGH.
AFTER THE REFORMATION MANY OTHER CHURCHES BEGAN BECAUSE OF DISAGREEMENTS OVER BELIEFS AND PRACTICES OF EARLIER PROTESTANT DOCTRINE. ACCORDING TO THE 2010 U.S. RELIGIOUS CONGREGATIONS AND MEMBERSHIP STUDY THIS ACCOUNTS FOR MOST OF THE PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. THERE ARE ABOUT 314 000 OF THESE. TWO EXAMPLES OF THESE PROTESTANT OR REFORMED CHURCHES ARE METHODIST AND BAPTIST.
CATTLE
CATTLE IS A WORD FOR CERTAIN MAMMALS THAT BELONG TO THE GENUS BOS. CATTLE MAY BE COWS BULLS OXEN HEIFERS STEERS BULLOCKS OR CALVES. CATTLE ARE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF LARGE DOMESTICATED HOOFED ANIMALS. THEY ARE A PROMINENT MODERN MEMBER OF THE SUBFAMILY BOVINAE.
CATTLE ARE LARGE GRAZING ANIMALS WITH TWO TOED OR CLOVEN HOOVES AND A FOUR CHAMBERED STOMACH. THIS STOMACH IS AN ADAPTATION TO HELP DIGEST TOUGH GRASSES. CATTLE CAN BE HORNED OR POLLED OR HORNLESS DEPENDING ON THE BREED. THE HORNS COME OUT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE HEAD ABOVE THE EARS AND ARE A SIMPLE SHAPE USUALLY CURVED UPWARDS BUT SOMETIMES DOWN. CATTLE USUALLY STAY TOGETHER IN GROUPS CALLED HERDS. ONE MALE CALLED A BULL WILL USUALLY HAVE A NUMBER OF COWS IN A HERD AS HIS HAREM. THE COWS USUALLY GIVE BIRTH TO ONE CALF A YEAR THOUGH TWINS ARE ALSO KNOWN TO BE BORN. THE CALVES HAVE LONG STRONG LEGS AND CAN WALK A FEW MINUTES AFTER THEY ARE BORN SO THEY CAN FOLLOW THE HERD. 
CATTLE ARE NATIVE TO MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD EXCEPT AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. CATTLE HAVE BEEN DOMESTICATED FOR ABOUT 9 000 YEARS. THEY ARE USED FOR MILK MEAT TRANSPORT ENTERTAINMENT AND POWER.
THE WORD CATTLE HAS BEEN USED IN ENGLISH FOR ABOUT 1 000 YEARS AND THE MEANING HAS CHANGED. IN BOOKS SUCH AS THE KING JAMES VERSION OF THE BIBLE THE WORD IS USED FOR ALL SORTS OF FARM ANIMALS INCLUDING HORSES SHEEP AND GOATS. THE WORD COMES FROM THE OLD FRENCH WORD CHATTELS MEANING ALL THE THINGS THAT A PERSON OWNS.
THE WORD CATTLE IS USED FOR SOME WILD ANIMALS AS WELL AS FOR DOMESTICATED CATTLE. WILD CATTLE INCLUDE THE WATER BUFFALO FROM SOUTH EAST ASIA THE MUSK OX AND YAK FROM CENTRAL ASIA THE BISON OF NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE AND THE AFRICAN BUFFALO. THE LAST AUROCHS WILD CATTLE OF EUROPE WERE KILLED IN MASOVIA POLAND IN 1627.
AN INTACT MALE BOVINE IS CALLED A BULL. A YOUNG MALE BOVINE IS CALLED A BULLOCK. A MATURE FEMALE THAT HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO AT LEAST ONE OR TWO CALVES IS CALLED A COW. A YOUNG BOVINE BETWEEN BIRTH AND WEANING IS CALLED A CALF. TWO OR MORE OF THESE YOUNG BOVINES ARE CALVES. A FEMALE THAT HAS NEVER HAD A CALF IS CALLED A HEIFER PRONOUNCED HEFFER. CALVING IS THE ACT OF A COW OR HEIFER GIVING BIRTH TO A CALF.
BECAUSE VERY FEW BULLS ARE NEEDED TO BREED WITH MANY COWS AND HEIFERS AND TO FORM A COMPLETE BREEDING HERD MOST MALE CATTLE ARE USED FOR MEAT. THEY ARE CASTRATED BY REMOVING THE TESTICLES TO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO BREED OTHER COWS AND HEIFERS AND TO TAKE AWAY THE MALE CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE COMMON WITH BULLS. A MALE THAT HAS BEEN CASTRATED BEFORE REACHING PUBERTY IS CALLED A STEER. AN OX IS A MALE BOVINE THAT HAS BEEN CASTRATED AFTER PUBERTY AND IS TRAINED AND USED FOR DRAFT PURPOSES SUCH AS PULLING A PLOW OR A WAGON. CATTLE CAN EITHER BE HORNED WHICH ARE TWO BONY POINTS COMING OUT ON EITHER SIDE OF A BEAST S HEAD ONE ON EACH SIDE OR POLLED WHERE NO HORNS ARE GROWN BUT A SOMEWHAT POINTY POLL IS FOUND AT THE TOP OF A COW S HEAD.
THE ADJECTIVE THAT IS USED TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING THAT IS LIKE A COW OR AN OX IS BOVINE.
THE WORDS COW BULL AND CALF ARE ALSO USED TO DESCRIBE SOME OTHER LARGE ANIMALS THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO CATTLE SUCH AS ELEPHANTS MOOSE AND WHALES.
CATTLE ARE FOUND ALL OVER THE WORLD FROM AS FAR NORTH AS CANADA AND RUSSIA TO THE DRY INLAND OF AUSTRALIA. THE ONLY CONTINENT THEY ARE NOT FOUND ON IS ANTARCTICA. DIFFERENT TYPES AND BREEDS OF CATTLE ARE SUITED TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS. BOS INDICUS CATTLE SUCH AS THE BRAHMAN BREED ARE SUITED TO SUBTROPICAL AND TROPICAL AREAS WHEREAS BOS TAURUS CATTLE SUCH AS ANGUS CATTLE ARE MORE SUITED TO TEMPERATE OR COLDER CLIMATES. THEIR LARGE WIDE HOOVES ARE GOOD IN BOTH WET AREAS AND DRY GRASSLAND. THEIR HAIRY COAT GROWS MUCH LONGER IN THE WINTER AND HAS AN EXTRA FLUFFY LAYER TO HOLD IN WARMTH. THEY SHED THIS EXTRA LAYER IN SPRINGTIME IN PREPARATION FOR THE HOT SUMMER AHEAD. MOST CATTLE EXCEPT THOSE OF THE BOS INDICUS SUBSPECIES DO NOT HAVE SWEAT GLANDS IN THEIR SKIN BUT THEIR WET NOSE IS A USEFUL COOLING SYSTEM. THEY CAN ALSO PANT LIKE A DOG AS WELL.
CATTLE CAN MAKE A RANGE OF NOISES FROM A GENTLE MOO TO A LOW GROWL IN WARNING OR TO ATTRACT FEMALES ESPECIALLY AMONG BULLS. WHEN THEY ARE ANGRY OR UPSET THEY CAN BELLOW OR BAWL QUITE LOUDLY. CALVES ARE SAID TO BAWL COWS MOO AND BULLS BELLOW.
CATTLE ARE HERBIVOROUS MEANING THAT THEY ARE PLANT EATING PRIMARILY GRASS ANIMALS. EATING GRASS IS CALLED GRAZING. THEY HAVE VERY STRONG TONGUES AND STRONG LOWER FRONT TEETH THAT HELP THEM TO GRAZE. UNLIKE A HORSE CATTLE DO NOT HAVE ANY UPPER FRONT TEETH. A COW OFTEN SWALLOWS GRASS WHOLE. AFTER A COW HAS EATEN ITS FILL AND IS RESTING THEY RETURN OR REGURGITATE THE GRASS FROM THEIR STOMACH TO THEIR MOUTH AND RECHEW IT WITH THEIR VERY LARGE BACK TEETH TO BREAK IT DOWN FURTHER. THIS IS CALLED CHEWING THE CUD. OTHER RUMINANTS LIKE DEER SHEEP AND GOATS ALSO DO THIS. HORSES DO NOT. THIS MEANS THAT CATTLE DO NOT NEED AS MUCH FOOD AS HORSES EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE.
CATTLE ARE RUMINANTS WHICH MEAN THEY HAVE A STOMACH WITH SEVERAL CHAMBERS WHICH HELPS DIGEST THEIR FOOD MORE EFFICIENTLY. A COW S STOMACH HAS FOUR CHAMBERS CALLED THE RETICULUM RUMEN OMASUM AND ABOMASUM. THE RETICULUM IS KNOWN AS THE HARDWARE STOMACH BECAUSE IT IS MAINLY USED AS A STORAGE AREA FOR HARD THINGS THAT THE COW MIGHT ACCIDENTALLY SWALLOW LIKE NAILS ROCKS AND OTHER OBJECTS. THE RUMEN IS THE LARGEST CHAMBER IN A RUMINANT S STOMACH AND IN CATTLE IT CAN HOLD UP TO 50 GALLONS FEED. IT IS THE CHAMBER WHERE FERMENTATION TAKES PLACE TO HELP BREAK DOWN THE GRASS THAT THE COW HAS EATEN. THE OMASUM ALSO KNOWN AS MANY PILES IS A COMPARTMENT THAT SQUEEZES OR ABSORBS ALL THE WATER THAT HAS ACCUMULATED FROM THE DIGESTION THAT HAS GONE ON IN THE RUMEN. THE FOURTH CHAMBER IS THE ABOMASUM WHICH SIMILAR IN FUNCTION TO A HUMAN S STOMACH AND SO IS CALLED THE TRUE STOMACH. 
COWS HAVE BREASTS CALLED UDDERS WHICH ARE JOINED TOGETHER IN A LARGE SAC OFTEN PINK IN COLOUR FOUND HANGING BETWEEN THE BACK LEGS. THE UDDER IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR PARTS OR QUARTERS EACH WITH A LARGE TEAT THAT THE CALF IS ABLE TO GRASP WITH ITS MOUTH TO SUCKLE FROM. COWS BEGIN MILK PRODUCTION A FEW DAYS BEFORE A CALF IS BORN AND CAN CONTINUE TO PRODUCE MILK WHEN BRED AGAIN AND WHEN PREGNANT WITH THEIR NEXT CALF. HEIFERS UNLESS THEY HAVE GIVEN BIRTH TO THEIR FIRST CALF DO NOT PRODUCE MILK. DAIRY COWS TEND TO HAVE MUCH LARGER UDDERS THAN BEEF COWS AND AS SUCH THESE TYPE OF COWS WILL USUALLY PRODUCE MORE MILK THAN WHAT IS NEEDED TO FEED ONE CALF. DAIRY COWS ARE FEMALE CATTLE THAT ARE RAISED TO PRODUCE LOTS OF MILK FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. BEEF COWS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE FEMALE CATTLE THAT ARE USED TO RAISE A CALF FROM BIRTH THAT IS USED FOR BEEF LATER IN ITS LIFE. BOTH TYPES OF COWS WILL KEEP PRODUCING MILK AS LONG AS IT IS DEMANDED EITHER BY THE CALF BY THE MILKING MACHINE OR BY THE HUMAN THAT IS HAND MILKING THEM. WHEN MILK FROM THEM IS NO LONGER NEEDED THEY WILL NOT EXPLODE THEY SIMPLY DRY UP WHERE THE MILK THEY PRODUCE IS ABSORBED OR TAKEN BACK IN BY THEIR BODIES. COWS ARE PREGNANT FOR AROUND 9 MONTHS OR AN AVERAGE OF 280 DAYS.
BULLS CAN OFTEN BE FIERCE AND DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR HERD OF COWS AND HEIFERS. IN THE WILD THEY WILL OFTEN FIGHT EACH OTHER OVER MATING RIGHTS AND THEIR HERDS OF COWS AND WILL USE THEIR HORNS TO GORE EACH OTHER. SOME BULLS WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH OTHERS WILL FIGHT UNTIL EITHER ONE OF THE BULLS DECIDES TO RUN OFF. THEY ALSO PROTECT THE HERDS FROM OTHER ANIMALS SUCH AS WOLVES JACKALS BEARS TIGERS AND LIONS. ON FARMS BULLS ARE USUALLY QUIETER AND MORE DOCILE AND CAN BE LED BY A NOSE RING BY THEIR OWNERS BUT THEY CAN BE AGGRESSIVE WITH OTHER BULLS AND WITH STRANGE PEOPLE OR ANIMALS WHO MIGHT GET TOO NEAR HIS HERD. DAIRY BULLS LIKE JERSEYS AND HOLSTEINS TEND TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN BULLS OF BEEF BREEDS LIKE HEREFORD AND ANGUS. NOT ALL CATTLE HAVE HORNS. BULLS WITH NO HORNS FIGHT BY HEAD BUTTING THE OTHER S HEAD NECK SIDE OR BELLY AND WILL USE THEIR HEADS TO PUSH EACH OTHER AROUND.
FOR THE REASONS ABOVE MOST MALE CATTLE ARE EITHER SENT TO SLAUGHTER WHILE THEY ARE STILL CALVES OR ARE CASTRATED SO THAT THEY ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO FIGHT EACH OTHER OR BE AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS THE FARMER THAT IS RAISING THEM MAKING THEM SAFER TO HANDLE AND KEEP UNTIL IT IS TIME TO SEND THEM TO MARKET. STEERS HAVE NO OTHER PURPOSE EXCEPT TO BE RAISED SOLD AND SLAUGHTERED FOR BEEF.
EVER SINCE PEOPLE STARTED USING CATTLE IN PREHISTORIC TIMES CATTLE HAVE BEEN A SIGN OF WEALTH. IN MANY COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY IN AFRICA AND ASIA A PERSON S WEALTH IS JUDGED BY THE NUMBER OF CATTLE THEY OWN. DIFFERENT BREEDS ARE USED DIFFERENTLY. 
CATTLE ARE VERY USEFUL ANIMALS. THEIR FLESH CAN BE EATEN AS MEAT. THEIR MILK CAN BE DRUNK AND TURNED INTO CHEESE AND YOGURT. THEIR SKIN CAN BE USED AS LEATHER. THEY CAN PULL CARTS AND PLOWS. THEY CAN MAKE THE POWER TO TURN FLOUR MILLS OR PUMP WATER. THE FOOD THAT THEY EAT IS NOT EXPENSIVE AND OFTEN NOT IN COMPETITION WITH WHAT PEOPLE EAT.
DAIRY CATTLE ARE KEPT AND RAISED SPECIALLY FOR MILKING. HERDS OF COWS ARE KEPT AND ARE REGULARLY MATED WITH A BULL SO THAT THEY PRODUCE CALVES. THIS KEEPS THE MILK SUPPLY GOING. HOWEVER MOST COMMERCIAL DAIRY FARMS DO NOT KEEP BULLS BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN THAT SUCH BULLS ARE VERY DANGEROUS WHEN BEING HANDLED. INSTEAD COWS ARE ARTIFICIALLY INSEMINATED WITH BULL SEMEN THAT IS STORED KEPT FROZEN IN LIQUID NITROGEN AND IS BRED BY A PERSON WHO ARTIFICIALLY INSEMINATES COWS FOR A LIVING.
SOME LARGE DAIRY HERDS ESPECIALLY THOSE USED TO PRODUCE ORGANIC OR FREE RANGE MILK ARE KEPT ON PASTURE WHERE THERE IS A GOOD SUPPLY OF GRASS AND THE FIELDS ARE RELATIVELY SMALL BUT NOT SO SMALL THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO GRAZE REGULARLY DURING THE SEASON WHEN GRASS IS GROWING. THIS IS BECAUSE THE COWS NEED TO BE BROUGHT IN FOR MILKING EVERY DAY TWICE A DAY AND SHOULD NOT HAVE FAR TO TRAVEL.
A NUMBER OF DAIRY HERDS ARE KEPT IN BARNS OR SHEDS FOR MOST OF THEIR LIVES AND ARE GIVEN FEED THAT HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY MADE FOR THEM. THIS FEED CONTAINS GRAIN LIKE CORN HAY INCLUDING GRASS AND ALFALFA OR CLOVER AND FERMENTED CHOPPED FEED CALLED SILAGE THAT IS USUALLY MADE FROM CORN WHEAT OR BARLEY. COWS ARE OFTEN KEPT IN STALLS WHERE THEY HAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO LAY DOWN COMFORTABLY. SUCH LARGE DAIRIES MUST SUPPLY STRAW OR SAW DUST FOR THE COWS TO REST ON WITHOUT GETTING SORE FROM THE HARD CONCRETE FLOOR.
COWS CAN BE MILKED BY HAND BUT IN MANY COUNTRIES WHERE THERE ARE LARGE DAIRIES THE COWS ARE MILKED BY A MILKING MACHINE. THE MILK IS COLLECTED IN A LARGE STAINLESS STEEL CONTAINER WHERE IT UNDERGOES PASTUERIZATION A PROCESS THAT HEATS MILK TO A VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE TO KILL ANY BACTERIA THAT ARE LIVING IN THE MILK. THE MILK IS THEN TAKEN BY TRUCK TO A MILK OR DAIRY FACTORY TO BE MADE INTO THE MILK WE DRINK BY BEING SEPARATED TO REMOVE MOST OF THE CREAM. IT IS THEN PUT INTO BOTTLES OR CARTONS TO BE SOLD. SOME MILK IS ALSO TURNED INTO CHEESE ICE CREAM BUTTER CREAM AND EVEN YOGURT. ALL OF THESE DAIRY PRODUCTS ARE PACKAGED OR PUT INTO CARTONS OR BOTTLES AND SOLD.
MANY TYPES OF CATTLE ARE USED FOR MILK. THEY INCLUDE 
BEEF CATTLE ARE BRED AND RAISED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE MEAT OR BEEF. STEERS ARE THE BEST TYPE FOR THIS PURPOSE BECAUSE THEY CAN BE KEPT IN HERDS WITHOUT FIGHTING EACH OTHER. HEIFERS ARE ALSO OFTEN USED FOR BEEF ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE NOT SUITABLE TO BE USED IN A BREEDING HERD. THE COWS OF BEEF CATTLE ARE USED TO GIVE BIRTH TO AND RAISE CALVES FOR MEAT. THEY ARE NOT USUALLY USED FOR MILK ALTHOUGH SOME TYPES OF CATTLE SUCH AS THE RED POLL DEXTER OR RED DEVON ALSO KNOWN AS THE NORTH DEVON OR DEVON ARE USED FOR BOTH. THESE TYPE OF CATTLE ARE CALLED DUAL PURPOSE BREEDS.
BEEF CATTLE ARE OFTEN ALLOWED GRAZE OVER LARGE AREAS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BE BROUGHT IN EVERY DAY LIKE DAIRY CATTLE. THE BIGGEST FARMS IN THE WORLD ARE CATTLE STATIONS IN AUSTRALIA RANCHES IN NORTH AMERICA AND RANCHOS IN LATIN AMERICA WHERE THEY RUN BEEF CATTLE.
UNTIL THE MID 20TH CENTURY BEEF CATTLE WERE OFTEN SENT TO MARKET ON THE HOOF. COWBOYS OR DROVERS WOULD HERD THE CATTLE ALONG THE ROADS OR ON TRAILS TO THE CATTLE MARKETS IN BIG TOWNS OR CITIES OR TO RAILWAY STATIONS WHERE THEY WOULD BE LOADED AND SHIPPED TO THESE TOWNS OR CITIES. IN AUSTRALIA SOMETIMES THE CATTLE WOULD TRAVEL FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES ALONG ROADS KNOWN AS TRAVELING STOCK ROUTES. BIG HERDS WOULD HAVE THOUSANDS OF HEADS OF CATTLE. CATTLE ARE COUNTED BY THE HEAD. NOWADAYS CATTLE ARE USUALLY SENT TO THE MARKET IN HUGE LORRIES KNOWN AS ROAD TRAINS. IN NORTH AMERICA CATTLE ARE SENT TO AUCTION MARTS SLAUGHTER PLANTS OR OTHER FARMS OR RANCHES BY LARGE SEMI TRUCKS CALLED CATTLE LINERS. 
THE MEAT FROM A CALF IS CALLED VEAL AND FROM AN OLDER BEAST BEEF. MEAT THAT IS CUT INTO FLAT PIECES FOR FRYING OR GRILLING IS CALLED STEAK. EVERY PART OF A BEAST CAN BE USED. THE SKIN BECOMES LEATHER. THE MEAT WHICH IS NOT USED BY HUMANS BECOMES PET FOOD AND ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT IS LEFT OVER BECOMES GARDEN FERTILIZER. MANY OTHER PRODUCTS CAN BE AND ARE OFTEN MADE FROM CATTLE FOR EXAMPLE CAR TIRES HOME INSULATION PAINT HAND LOTION SOAP JELLO AND MANY DRUGS ARE MADE FROM PARTS OF CATTLE. COW S BLOOD IS OFTEN USED IN SPECIAL EFFECTS IN THE CREATION OF ACTION OR HORROR MOVIES. BONES FROM CATTLE CAN BE MADE INTO KNIFE HANDLES OR NAPKIN RINGS. THE LIST IS ENDLESS.
TYPES OF CATTLE THAT ARE USED FOR BEEF 
OXEN ARE CATTLE TRAINED AS WORK ANIMALS. THE WORD OX IS USED TO DESCRIBE JUST ONE. THEY ARE CASTRATED MALES STEERS.
AN OX IS OVER FOUR YEARS OLD AND GROWN TO FULL SIZE WHEN IT BEGINS TO WORK. OXEN ARE USED FOR PULLING PLOWS AND WAGONS FOR HAULING HEAVY LOADS LIKE LOGS OR FOR POWERING DIFFERENT MACHINES SUCH AS MILLS AND IRRIGATION PUMPS.
OXEN ARE MOST OFTEN USED IN TEAMS OF TWO FOR LIGHT WORK SUCH AS PLOWING. IN PAST DAYS VERY LARGE TEAMS OF FOURTEEN TO TWENTY OXEN WERE USED FOR HEAVY WORK SUCH AS LOGGING. THE OXEN ARE PUT INTO PAIRS AND EACH PAIR MUST WORK TOGETHER. A WOODEN YOKE IS PUT ABOUT THE NECK OF EACH PAIR SO THAT THE WORK IS SHARED ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS. OXEN ARE CHOSEN FROM CERTAIN BREEDS WITH HORNS SINCE THE HORNS HOLD THE YOKE IN PLACE WHEN THE OXEN LOWER THEIR HEADS BACK UP OR SLOW DOWN.
OXEN MUST BE TRAINED FROM A YOUNG AGE. THE OWNER MUST MAKE OR BUY AS MANY AS A DOZEN YOKES OF DIFFERENT SIZES AS THE ANIMALS GROW. OX TEAMS ARE STEERED BY SHOUTED COMMANDS WHISTLES OR THE NOISE OF A WHIP CRACK. MEN WHO DROVE OX TEAMS WERE CALLED TEAMSTERS IN AMERICA WAGONERS IN BRITAIN OR IN AUSTRALIA BULLOCKIES. MANY BULLOCKIES AND TEAMSTERS WERE FAMOUS FOR THEIR VOICES AND FOR THEIR FOUL LANGUAGE.
OXEN CAN PULL HARDER AND LONGER THAN HORSES ESPECIALLY FOR VERY LARGE LOADS. THEY ARE NOT AS FAST AS HORSES BUT THEY ARE LESS OFTEN INJURED OR LESS LIKELY TO STARTLE THAN HORSES ARE. MANY OXEN ARE STILL IN USE ALL OVER THE WORLD ESPECIALLY IN POOR COUNTRIES.
CELL
IN BIOLOGY THE CELL IS THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF ORGANISMS. ALL CELLS ARE MADE BY THE DIVISION OF OTHER CELLS.
THE ENVIRONMENT OUTSIDE THE CELL IS SEPARATED FROM THE CYTOPLASM INSIDE THE CELL BY THE CELL MEMBRANE. INSIDE SOME CELLS PARTS OF THE CELL STAY SEPARATE FROM OTHER PARTS. THESE SEPARATE PARTS ARE CALLED ORGANELLES LIKE SMALL ORGANS. THEY EACH DO DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE CELL. EXAMPLES ARE THE NUCLEUS WHERE DNA IS AND MITOCHONDRIA WHERE CHEMICAL ENERGY IS CONVERTED.
THERE ARE TWO BASIC KINDS OF CELLS PROKARYOTIC CELLS AND EUKARYOTIC CELLS. PROKARYOTES BACTERIA AND ARCHAEA ARE SIMPLE CELLS THAT HAVE NO CELL NUCLEUS. THEY DO HAVE BACTERIAL MICROCOMPARTMENTS.
EUKARYOTES ARE COMPLEX CELLS WITH MANY ORGANELLES AND OTHER STRUCTURES IN THE CELL. THEY ARE LARGER THAN PROKARYOTE CELLS THEY CAN BE AS MUCH AS 1000 TIMES GREATER IN VOLUME. EUKARYOTES STORE THEIR GENETIC INFORMATION DNA ON CHROMOSOMES IN THE CELL NUCLEUS. ORGANISMS LIVING THINGS WHICH ARE MADE UP OF MULTIPLE CELLS ARE EUKARYOTES.
THE ONLY KINDS OF PROKARYOTIC ORGANISMS ALIVE AT PRESENT ARE BACTERIA AND ARCHAEA. PROKARYOTIC ORGANISMS EVOLVED BEFORE EUKARYOTIC ORGANISMS SO AT ONE POINT THE WORLD CONSISTED OF NOTHING BUT PROKARYOTIC ORGANISMS. THERE ARE ALSO VIRUSES WHICH ARE HARD TO CLASSIFY BUT CAUSE SOME IMPORTANT DISEASES. VIRUSES ARE MADE OF RNA OR DNA AND PROTEIN AND THEY REPRODUCE THEMSELVES INSIDE THE CELLS OF BACTERIA OR EUKARYOTES.
UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS ARE MADE UP OF ONE CELL. EXAMPLES OF UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS ARE 
UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS NEED TO 
ALL UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS MUST 
SOME MAY 
MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS ARE MADE FROM MANY CELLS. THEY ARE COMPLEX ORGANISMS. THIS CAN BE A SMALL NUMBER OF CELLS OR MILLIONS OR TRILLIONS OF CELLS. ALL PLANTS AND ANIMALS ARE MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS. THE CELLS OF A MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM ARE NOT ALL THE SAME. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES AND DO DIFFERENT WORK IN THE ORGANISM. THE CELLS ARE SPECIALIZED. THIS MEANS THEY DO ONLY SOME KINDS OF WORK. BY THEMSELVES THEY CANNOT DO EVERYTHING THAT THE ORGANISM NEEDS TO LIVE. THEY NEED OTHER CELLS TO DO OTHER WORK. THEY LIVE TOGETHER BUT CANNOT LIVE ALONE.
CELLS WERE DISCOVERED BY ROBERT HOOKE 1635 1703. HE USED A COMPOUND MICROSCOPE WITH TWO LENSES TO LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE OF CORK AND TO LOOK AT LEAVES AND SOME INSECTS. HE DID THIS FROM ABOUT 1660 AND REPORTED IT IN HIS BOOK MICROGRAPHICA IN 1665. HE NAMED CELLS AFTER THE LATIN WORD CELLA MEANING ROOM. HE DID THIS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT CELLS LOOKED LIKE SMALL ROOMS.
MANY OTHER NATURALISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS TRIED OUT THE NEW INSTRUMENT. THE STRUCTURE OF PLANTS WAS INVESTIGATED BY NEHEMIAH GREW 1641 1712 AND MARCELLO MALPIGHI 1628 1694. GREW S MAJOR WORK WAS THE ANATOMY OF PLANTS 1682. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHO FIRST SAW ANIMAL CELLS MALPIGHI JAN SWAMMERDAM 1637 1680 OR ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK 1632 1723.
LEEUWENHOEK S DISCOVERIES AND DRAWINGS OF LITTLE ANIMALULES OPENED UP A WHOLE NEW WORLD FOR NATURALISTS. PROTOZOA AND MICROORGANISMS GENERALLY WERE DISCOVERED AND THE DISCOVERIES ABOUT THEM ARE STILL GOING ON TODAY. CHRISTIAN GOTTFRIED EHRENBERG S BOOK DIE INFUSIONSTHIERCHEN SUMMARISED WHAT WAS KNOWN IN 1838. LORENZ OKEN 1779 1851 IN 1805 WROTE THAT INFUSORIA MICROSCOPIC FORMS WERE THE BASIS OF ALL LIFE. 
THE IDEA THAT CELLS WERE THE BASIS OF THE LARGER FORMS OF LIFE CAME IN THE 18TH CENTURY. FINDING OUT WHO DID THE WORK HAS TAKEN SOME TIME 
THE CELL THEORY INCLUDES THESE IMPORTANT IDEAS 
THE BODY CELLS OF METAZOANS DIVIDE BY SIMPLE MITOTIC CELL DIVISION. SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IS ANCESTRAL IN EUKARYOTES AND IN METAZOA IT IS CARRIED OUT BY SPECIALISED SEX CELLS. THEY ARE PRODUCED BY A PROCESS CALLED MEIOSIS. 
PROKARYOTIC CELLS REPRODUCE USING BINARY FISSION WHERE THE CELL SIMPLY SPLITS IN HALF. FOR BOTH MITOSIS AND BINARY FISSION THE CELL MUST REPLICATE COPY ALL ITS GENETIC INFORMATION DNA SO THAT EACH NEW CELL WILL HAVE A COPY.
CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT
A CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT CPU IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF EVERY COMPUTER. THE CPU SENDS SIGNALS TO CONTROL THE OTHER PARTS OF THE COMPUTER ALMOST LIKE HOW A BRAIN CONTROLS A BODY.
THE CPU IS AN ELECTRONIC MACHINE THAT WORKS ON A LIST OF COMPUTER THINGS TO DO CALLED INSTRUCTIONS. IT READS THE LIST OF INSTRUCTIONS AND DOES EXECUTES EACH ONE IN ORDER. A LIST OF INSTRUCTIONS THAT A CPU CAN RUN IS A COMPUTER PROGRAM.
THE CLOCK RATE OR SPEED OF A CPU S INTERNAL PARTS IS MEASURED IN HERTZ HZ. MODERN PROCESSORS OFTEN RUN SO FAST THAT GIGAHERTZ GHZ IS USED INSTEAD. ONE GHZ IS ONE BILLION CYCLES PER SECOND.
MOST CPUS USED IN DESKTOP HOME COMPUTERS ARE MADE BY EITHER INTEL OR ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES USUALLY SHORTENED TO AMD. SOME OTHER COMPANIES THAT MAKE CPUS ARE ARM IBM AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS. MOST OF THEIR CPUS ARE USED IN EMBEDDED SYSTEMS FOR MORE SPECIALIZED THINGS LIKE IN MOBILE PHONES CARS GAME CONSOLES OR IN THE MILITARY.
IN THE 20TH CENTURY ENGINEERS INVENTED MANY DIFFERENT COMPUTER ARCHITECTURES. NOWADAYS MOST DESKTOP COMPUTERS USE EITHER 32 BIT CPUS OR 64 BIT CPUS. THE INSTRUCTIONS IN A 32 BIT CPU ARE GOOD AT HANDLING DATA THAT IS 32 BITS IN SIZE MOST INSTRUCTIONS THINK IN 32 BITS IN A 32 BIT CPU. LIKEWISE A 64 BIT CPU IS GOOD AT HANDLING DATA THAT IS 64 BITS IN SIZE AND OFTEN GOOD AT HANDLING 32 BIT DATA TOO. THE SIZE OF DATA THAT A CPU HANDLES BEST IS OFTEN CALLED THE WORD SIZE OF THE CPU. MANY OLD CPUS FROM THE 70S 80S AND EARLY 90S AND MANY MODERN EMBEDDED SYSTEMS HAVE AN 8 BIT OR 16 BIT WORD SIZE. WHEN CPUS WERE INVENTED IN THE MIDDLE 20TH CENTURY THEY HAD MANY DIFFERENT WORD SIZES. SOME HAD DIFFERENT WORD SIZES FOR INSTRUCTIONS AND DATA. THE LESS POPULAR WORD SIZES LATER STOPPED BEING USED.
MOST CPUS ARE MICROPROCESSORS. THIS MEANS THAT THE CPU IS JUST A SINGLE CHIP. SOME CHIPS WITH MICROPROCESSORS INSIDE THEM ALSO CONTAIN OTHER COMPONENTS AND ARE COMPLETE SINGLE CHIP COMPUTERS. THIS IS CALLED A MICROCONTROLLER.
WHEN THE CPU RUNS A COMPUTER PROGRAM IT NEEDS SOMEWHERE TO STORE THE DATA THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS OPERATE ON THE DATA THAT THEY READ AND WRITE. THIS STORAGE IS CALLED A REGISTER. A CPU USUALLY HAS MANY REGISTERS. REGISTERS MUST BE VERY FAST TO ACCESS TO READ AND WRITE. THEREFORE THEY ARE PART OF THE CPU CHIP ITSELF.
STORING ALL DATA IN REGISTERS WOULD MAKE MOST CPUS TOO COMPLICATED AND VERY EXPENSIVE. THEREFORE REGISTERS USUALLY ONLY STORE THE DATA THAT THE CPU IS WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. THE REST OF THE DATA USED BY THE PROGRAM IS STORED IN RAM MEMORY. EXCEPT IN MICROCONTROLLERS RAM IS USUALLY STORED OUTSIDE THE CPU IN SEPARATE CHIPS.
WHEN THE CPU WANTS TO READ OR WRITE DATA IN RAM IT OUTPUTS AN ADDRESS TO THAT DATA. EACH BYTE IN RAM HAS A MEMORY ADDRESS. THE SIZE OF ADDRESSES IS OFTEN THE SAME AS THE WORD SIZE A 32 BIT CPU USES 32 BIT ADDRESSES ETC. HOWEVER SMALLER CPUS LIKE 8 BIT CPUS OFTEN USE ADDRESSES THAT ARE LARGER THAN THE WORD SIZE. OTHERWISE THE MAXIMUM PROGRAM LENGTH WOULD BE TOO SHORT.
BECAUSE THE SIZE OF ADDRESSES IS LIMITED THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF MEMORY IS ALSO LIMITED. 32 BIT PROCESSORS CAN USUALLY ONLY HANDLE UP TO 4 GB OF RAM. THIS IS THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BYTES THAT CAN BE SELECTED USING A 32 BIT ADDRESS EACH BIT CAN HAVE TWO VALUES 0 AND 1 AND 2 BYTES IS 4 GB. A 64 BIT PROCESSOR MIGHT BE ABLE TO HANDLE UP TO 16 EB OF RAM 16 EXABYTES AROUND 16 BILLION GB OR 16 BILLION BILLION BYTES. THE OPERATING SYSTEM MAY LIMIT IT TO USING SMALLER AMOUNTS.
THE INFORMATION THAT IS STORED IN RAM IS USUALLY VOLATILE. THIS MEANS THAT IT WILL DISAPPEAR IF THE COMPUTER IS TURNED OFF.
ON MODERN COMPUTERS RAM IS MUCH SLOWER THAN REGISTERS SO ACCESSING RAM SLOWS DOWN PROGRAMS. TO SPEED UP MEMORY ACCESSES A FASTER TYPE OF MEMORY CALLED A CACHE IS OFTEN PUT BETWEEN THE RAM AND THE MAIN PARTS OF THE CPU. THE CACHE IS USUALLY A PART OF THE CPU CHIP ITSELF AND IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE PER BYTE THAN RAM. THE CACHE STORES THE SAME DATA AS RAM BUT IS USUALLY MUCH SMALLER. THEREFORE ALL THE DATA USED BY THE PROGRAM MIGHT NOT FIT IN THE CACHE. THE CACHE TRIES TO STORE DATA THAT IS LIKELY TO BE USED A LOT. EXAMPLES INCLUDE RECENTLY USED DATA AND DATA CLOSE IN MEMORY TO RECENTLY USED DATA.
OFTEN IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A CACHE FOR THE CACHE JUST AS IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A CACHE FOR RAM. IN MULTI LEVEL CACHING THERE ARE MANY CACHES CALLED THE L1 CACHE THE L2 CACHE AND SO ON. THE L1 CACHE IS THE FASTEST AND MOST EXPENSIVE PER BYTE CACHE AND IS CLOSEST TO THE CPU. THE L2 CACHE IS ONE STEP AWAY AND IS SLOWER THAN THE L1 CACHE ETC. THE L1 CACHE CAN OFTEN BE VIEWED AS A CACHE FOR THE L2 CACHE ETC.
COMPUTER BUSES ARE THE WIRES USED BY THE CPU TO COMMUNICATE WITH RAM AND OTHER COMPONENTS IN THE COMPUTER. ALMOST ALL CPUS HAVE AT LEAST A DATA BUS USED TO READ AND WRITE DATA AND AN ADDRESS BUS USED TO OUTPUT ADDRESSES. OTHER BUSES INSIDE THE CPU CARRY DATA TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CPU.
AN INSTRUCTION SET ALSO CALLED AN ISA INSTRUCTION SET ARCHITECTURE IS A LANGUAGE UNDERSTOOD DIRECTLY BY A PARTICULAR CPU. THESE LANGUAGES ARE ALSO CALLED MACHINE CODE OR BINARY. THEY SAY HOW YOU TELL THE CPU TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE LOADING DATA FROM MEMORY INTO A REGISTER OR ADDING THE VALUES FROM TWO REGISTERS. EACH INSTRUCTION IN AN INSTRUCTION SET HAS AN ENCODING WHICH IS HOW THE INSTRUCTION IS WRITTEN AS A SEQUENCE OF BITS.
PROGRAMS WRITTEN IN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES LIKE C AND C CAN T BE RUN DIRECTLY BY THE CPU. THEY MUST BE TRANSLATED INTO MACHINE CODE BEFORE THE CPU CAN RUN THEM. A COMPILER IS A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT DOES THIS TRANSLATION.
MACHINE CODE IS JUST A SEQUENCE OF 0S AND 1S WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR HUMANS TO READ IT. TO MAKE IT MORE READABLE MACHINE CODE PROGRAMS ARE USUALLY WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE. ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE USES TEXT INSTEAD OF 0S AND 1S YOU MIGHT WRITE LD A 0 TO LOAD THE VALUE 0 INTO REGISTER A FOR EXAMPLE. A PROGRAM THAT TRANSLATES ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE INTO MACHINE CODE IS CALLED AN ASSEMBLER.
HERE ARE SOME OF THE BASIC THINGS A CPU CAN DO 
EVEN VERY COMPLICATED PROGRAMS CAN BE MADE BY COMBINING MANY SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS LIKE THESE. THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE EACH INSTRUCTION TAKES A VERY SHORT TIME TO HAPPEN. MANY CPUS TODAY CAN DO MORE THAN 1 BILLION 1 000 000 000 INSTRUCTIONS IN A SINGLE SECOND. IN GENERAL THE MORE A CPU CAN DO IN A GIVEN TIME THE FASTER IT IS. ONE WAY TO MEASURE A PROCESSOR S SPEED IS MIPS MILLION INSTRUCTIONS PER SECOND. FLOPS FLOATING POINT OPERATIONS PER SECOND AND CPU CLOCK SPEED USUALLY MEASURED IN GIGAHERTZ ARE ALSO WAYS TO MEASURE HOW MUCH WORK A PROCESSOR CAN DO IN A CERTAIN TIME.
A CPU IS BUILT OUT OF LOGIC GATES IT HAS NO MOVING PARTS. THE CPU OF A COMPUTER IS CONNECTED ELECTRONICALLY TO OTHER PARTS OF THE COMPUTER LIKE THE VIDEO CARD OR THE BIOS. A COMPUTER PROGRAM CAN CONTROL THESE PERIPHERALS BY READING OR WRITING NUMBERS TO SPECIAL PLACES IN THE COMPUTER S MEMORY.
EACH INSTRUCTION EXECUTED BY A CPU IS USUALLY DONE IN MANY STEPS. FOR EXAMPLE THE STEPS TO RUN AN INSTRUCTION INC A INCREASE THE VALUE STORED IN REGISTER A BY ONE ON A SIMPLE CPU COULD BE THIS 
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CPU DO THESE DIFFERENT THINGS. OFTEN IT IS POSSIBLE TO RUN SOME STEPS FROM DIFFERENT INSTRUCTIONS AT THE SAME TIME WHICH MAKES THE CPU FASTER. FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN READ AN INSTRUCTION FROM MEMORY AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE DECODE ANOTHER INSTRUCTION SINCE THOSE STEPS USE DIFFERENT MODULES. THIS CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS HAVING MANY INSTRUCTIONS INSIDE THE PIPELINE AT ONCE. IN THE BEST CASE ALL OF THE MODULES ARE WORKING ON DIFFERENT INSTRUCTIONS AT ONCE BUT THIS IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE.
MODERN CPUS OFTEN USE A MEMORY MANAGEMENT UNIT MMU. AN MMU IS A COMPONENT THAT TRANSLATES ADDRESSES FROM THE CPU TO USUALLY DIFFERENT RAM ADDRESSES. WHEN USING AN MMU THE ADDRESSES USED IN A PROGRAM ARE USUALLY NOT THE REAL ADDRESSES WHERE THE DATA IS STORED. THIS IS CALLED VIRTUAL THE OPPOSITE OF REAL MEMORY. A FEW OF THE REASONS WHY IT IS GOOD TO HAVE AN MMU ARE LISTED BELOW 
MULTI CORE PROCESSORS BECAME COMMON IN THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY. THIS MEANS THAT THEY HAVE MANY PROCESSORS BUILT ON TO THE SAME CHIP SO THAT THEY CAN RUN MANY INSTRUCTIONS AT ONCE. SOME PROCESSORS MAY HAVE UP TO THIRTY TWO CORES LIKE THE AMD EPYC 7601.
THE FOLLOWING COMPANIES MAKE COMPUTER CPUS 
CHARLES DARWIN
CHARLES ROBERT DARWIN 12 FEBRUARY 1809 19 APRIL 1882 WAS AN ENGLISH NATURALIST. HE WAS BORN IN SHREWSBURY SHROPSHIRE. HE IS FAMOUS FOR HIS WORK ON THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION. 
HIS BOOK ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 1859 DID TWO THINGS. FIRST IT PROVIDED A GREAT DEAL OF EVIDENCE THAT EVOLUTION HAS TAKEN PLACE. SECOND IT PROPOSED A THEORY TO EXPLAIN HOW EVOLUTION WORKS. THAT THEORY IS NATURAL SELECTION. EVOLUTION AND NATURAL SELECTION IS THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING AND THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE ON EARTH.
DARWIN SPENT ALMOST FIVE YEARS ON BOARD A ROYAL NAVY EXPLORING SHIP THE HMS BEAGLE. HE WAS THE GUEST NATURALIST WHICH MEANT THAT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING COLLECTIONS AND NOTES ABOUT THE ANIMALS PLANTS AND THE GEOLOGY OF THE COUNTRIES THEY VISITED. THE SHIP S CREW MADE CHARTS OF ALL THE COASTAL AREAS WHICH COULD BE USED BY THE NAVY WHEREVER IT WENT IN THE WORLD. AT THE TIME BRITAIN HAD BY FAR THE LARGEST NAVY IN THE WORLD AND AN EMPIRE WHICH WAS GLOBAL. 
DARWIN COLLECTED EVERYWHERE THE SHIP WEIGHED ANCHOR. HE FOUND HUGE FOSSILS OF RECENTLY EXTINCT MAMMALS EXPERIENCED AN EARTHQUAKE IN CHILE AND NOTICED THE LAND HAD BEEN RAISED. HE KNEW OF RAISED BEACHES ELSEWHERE HIGH IN THE ANDES WITH FOSSIL SEASHELLS AND TREES WHICH HAD ONCE GROWN ON A SANDY BEACH. OBVIOUSLY THE EARTH WAS CONSTANTLY CHANGING WITH LAND RISING IN SOME PLACES AND SINKING IN OTHERS. HE COLLECTED BIRDS AND INSECTS AND SENT SHIPMENTS BACK TO CAMBRIDGE FOR EXPERTS TO IDENTIFY. 
DARWIN WAS THE FIRST DEDICATED NATURALIST TO VISIT THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS OFF THE WEST COAST OF ECUADOR. HE NOTICED THAT SOME OF THE BIRDS WERE LIKE MOCKINGBIRDS ON THE MAINLAND BUT DIFFERENT ENOUGH TO BE PLACED IN SEPARATE SPECIES. HE BEGAN TO WONDER HOW SO MANY NEW SPECIES CAME TO BE ON THESE ISLANDS.
WHEN DARWIN GOT BACK TO ENGLAND HE EDITED A SERIES OF SCIENTIFIC REVIEWS OF THE VOYAGE AND WROTE A PERSONAL JOURNAL WHICH WE KNOW AS THE VOYAGE OF THE BEAGLE. IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT NATURAL HISTORY TRAVEL DIARIES.
IN 1843 DARWIN WHO ALREADY HAD TWO CHILDREN WITH HIS WIFE EMMA BOUGHT DOWN HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE OF DOWNE KENT. HE LIVED THERE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE AND TODAY THE HOUSE AND CONTENTS ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.
WHILE ON H.M.S. BEAGLE AND LATER BACK HOME IN LONDON DARWIN HAD COME ACROSS THE IDEAS OF THE REV. T.R. MALTHUS. MALTHUS HAD REALISED THAT ALTHOUGH HUMANS COULD DOUBLE THEIR POPULATION EVERY 25 YEARS IT DID NOT HAPPEN IN PRACTICE. HE THOUGHT THE REASON WAS THAT A STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE OR RESOURCES LIMITED THEIR NUMBERS. IF NUMBERS INCREASED THEN FAMINE WARS AND DISEASES CAUSED MORE DEATHS. DARWIN WHO KNEW THAT ALL LIVING THINGS COULD IN PRINCIPLE INCREASE THEIR NUMBERS BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT WHY SOME SURVIVED WHILE OTHERS DID NOT. HIS ANSWER TOOK YEARS TO DEVELOP.
THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION SAYS THAT ALL LIVING THINGS ON EARTH INCLUDING PLANTS ANIMALS AND MICROBES COME FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR BY SLOWLY CHANGING THROUGHOUT THE GENERATIONS. DARWIN SUGGESTED THAT THE WAY LIVING THINGS CHANGED OVER TIME IS THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION. THIS IS THE BETTER SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION OF THOSE THAT BEST FIT THEIR ENVIRONMENT. FITTING INTO THE PLACE WHERE YOU LIVE IS CALLED ADAPTING. THOSE WHO FIT BEST INTO THE PLACE WHERE THEY LIVE THE BEST ADAPTED HAVE THE BEST CHANCE TO SURVIVE AND BREED. THOSE WHO ARE LESS WELL ADAPTED TEND NOT TO SURVIVE. IF THEY DO NOT SURVIVE WELL ENOUGH TO RAISE YOUNG THIS MEANS THEY DO NOT PASS ON THEIR GENES. IN THIS WAY THE SPECIES GRADUALLY CHANGES.
THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE ORIGIN DEALS WITH DOMESTICATED ANIMALS SUCH AS CATTLE AND DOGS. DARWIN REMINDED READERS OF THE HUGE CHANGES MANKIND HAD MADE IN ITS DOMESTIC ANIMALS WHICH WERE ONCE WILD SPECIES. THE CHANGES WERE BROUGHT ABOUT BY SELECTIVE BREEDING CHOOSING ANIMALS WITH DESIRABLE CHARACTERS TO BREED FROM. THIS HAD BEEN DONE GENERATION AFTER GENERATION UNTIL OUR MODERN BREEDS WERE PRODUCED. PERHAPS WHAT MAN HAD DONE DELIBERATELY MIGHT HAPPEN IN NATURE WHERE SOME WOULD LEAVE MORE OFFSPRING THAN OTHERS. 
DARWIN NOTICED THAT ALTHOUGH YOUNG PLANTS OR ANIMALS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THEIR PARENTS NO TWO ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AND THERE IS ALWAYS A RANGE OF SHAPE SIZE COLOUR AND SO ON. SOME OF THESE DIFFERENCES THE PLANT OR ANIMAL MAY HAVE GOT FROM THEIR OWN ANCESTORS BUT SOME ARE NEW AND CAUSED BY MUTATIONS. WHEN SUCH DIFFERENCES MADE AN ORGANISM MORE ABLE TO LIVE IN THE WILD IT WOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE TO SURVIVE AND WOULD PASS ON ITS GENES TO ITS OFFSPRING AND THEY TO THEIR OFFSPRING. ANY DIFFERENCE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE PLANT OR ANIMAL TO HAVE LESS OF A CHANCE TO LIVE WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO BE PASSED ON AND WOULD EVENTUALLY DIE OUT ALTOGETHER. IN THIS WAY GROUPS OF SIMILAR PLANTS OR ANIMALS CALLED SPECIES SLOWLY CHANGE IN SHAPE AND FORM SO THAT THEY CAN LIVE MORE SUCCESSFULLY AND HAVE MORE OFFSPRING WHO WILL SURVIVE THEM. SO NATURAL SELECTION HAD SIMILARITIES TO SELECTIVE BREEDING EXCEPT THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN BY ITSELF OVER A MUCH LONGER TIME.
HE FIRST STARTED THINKING ABOUT THIS IN 1838 BUT IT TOOK A FULL TWENTY YEARS BEFORE HIS IDEAS BECAME PUBLIC. BY 1844 HE WAS ABLE TO WRITE A DRAFT OF THE MAIN IDEAS IN HIS NOTEBOOK. HISTORIANS THINK THAT HE DID NOT TALK ABOUT HIS THEORY BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID OF PUBLIC CRITICISM. HE KNEW HIS THEORY WHICH DID NOT DISCUSS RELIGION RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LITERAL TRUTH OF THE BOOK OF GENESIS. WHATEVER THE REASON HE DID NOT PUBLISH HIS THEORY IN A BOOK UNTIL 1859. IN 1858 HE HEARD THAT ANOTHER BIOLOGIST ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE HAD THE SAME IDEAS ABOUT NATURAL SELECTION. DARWIN AND WALLACE S IDEAS WERE FIRST PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF THE LINNAEAN SOCIETY IN LONDON 1858. THEN DARWIN PUBLISHED HIS BOOK THE NEXT YEAR. THE NAME OF THE BOOK WAS ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES BY MEANS OF NATURAL SELECTION OR THE PRESERVATION OF FAVOURED RACES IN THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE. THIS IS USUALLY CALLED THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. 
DARWIN WROTE A NUMBER OF OTHER BOOKS MOST OF WHICH ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT.
CHARLIE CHAPLIN
SIR CHARLES SPENCER CHARLIE CHAPLIN 16 APRIL 1889 25 DECEMBER 1977 WAS A BRITISH ACTOR COMEDIAN MOVIE MAKER SCREENWRITER EDITOR MUSICIAN AND AUTHOR. HE WAS VERY FAMOUS IN SILENT MOVIES WHERE THERE WAS NO TALKING OR SOUND. HE ACTED DIRECTED SCRIPTED AND PRODUCED MOST OF THEM.
CHARLIE CHAPLIN WAS A PERFORMER FOR ALMOST 70 YEARS. HE STARTED WORKING WHEN HE WAS 5 AND WORKED UNTIL HE WAS 80. THE CHARACTER THAT CHARLIE CHAPLIN PLAYED MOST WAS CALLED THE LITTLE TRAMP. THE TRAMP WAS A MAN OF GOOD MANNERS WHO WORE A COAT A PAIR OF BIG TROUSERS SHOES MUSTACHE AND A BLACK HAT.
CHARLES SPENCER CHAPLIN WAS BORN ON APRIL 16 1889 IN LONDON ENGLAND UNITED KINGDOM. CHAPLIN HAD A ROUGH CHILDHOOD HIS MOTHER HANNAH HILL CHAPLIN A TALENTED SINGER ACTRESS AND PIANO PLAYER SPENT MOST OF HER LIFE IN AND OUT OF MENTAL HOSPITALS. HIS FATHER CHARLES SPENCER CHAPLIN SR. WAS A FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL SINGER UNTIL HE BEGAN DRINKING. AFTER HIS PARENTS SEPARATED CHARLIE AND HIS HALF BROTHER SIDNEY SPENT MOST OF THEIR CHILDHOOD IN ORPHANAGES WHERE THEY OFTEN WENT HUNGRY AND WERE BEATEN IF THEY MISBEHAVED. HE FIRST STARTED ACTING AT AGE FIVE. HE ACTED IN A MUSIC HALL IN 1894 STANDING IN FOR HIS MOTHER.
WHEN CHARLIE WAS A CHILD HE WAS KEPT IN BED FOR MANY WEEKS FROM A BAD ILLNESS. AT NIGHT HIS MOTHER WOULD SIT AT THE WINDOW AND ACT OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE. HIS FIRST IMPORTANT WORK CAME WHEN HE JOINED THE EIGHT LANCASHIRE LADS. IN 1900 HIS BROTHER SYDNEY HELPED HIM GET THE ROLE OF A COMIC CAT IN THE PANTOMIME CINDERELLA. IN 1903 HE WAS IN A PLAY CALLED JIM A ROMANCE OF COCKAYNE. CHAPLIN WAS IN CASEY S COURT CIRCUS VARIETY SHOW. THE NEXT YEAR HE BECAME A CLOWN IN FRED KARNO S FUN FACTORY COMEDY COMPANY.
CHAPLIN WAS THE TARGET OF AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT WHICH TOOK THE LIFE OF PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN INUKAI TSUYOSHI. 
ON MAY 15 1932 PRIME MINISTER INUKAI TSUYOSHI WAS SHOT BY ELEVEN YOUNG NAVAL OFFICERS MOST WERE JUST TURNING TWENTY YEARS OF AGE IN THE PRIME MINISTER S RESIDENCE. THE ORIGINAL ASSASSINATION PLAN HAD INCLUDED KILLING CHAPLIN WHO HAD ARRIVED IN JAPAN ON MAY 14 1932 AT A RECEPTION FOR CHAPLIN PLANNED BY PRIME MINISTER INUKAI. WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER WAS KILLED HIS SON INUKAI TAKERU WAS WATCHING A SUMO WRESTLING MATCH WITH CHARLIE CHAPLIN WHICH PROBABLY SAVED BOTH THEIR LIVES.
CHAPLIN WON TWO SPECIAL OSCARS. CHAPLIN HAD FIRST BEEN CHOSEN FOR BOTH BEST ACTOR AND BEST COMEDY DIRECTING. BUT THEN INSTEAD HE WAS GIVEN A SPECIAL AWARD FOR VERSATILITY AND GENIUS IN ACTING WRITING DIRECTING AND PRODUCING. CHAPLIN S SECOND SPECIAL AWARD CAME 44 YEARS LATER IN 1972. WHEN GETTING THIS AWARD CHAPLIN HAD THE LONGEST STANDING OVATION PEOPLE STANDING UP AND CLAPPING IN ACADEMY AWARD HISTORY. IN 1976 HE WAS GIVEN THE BAFTA ACADEMY FELLOWSHIP AWARD A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD. CHAPLIN BECAME THE FIRST ACTOR TO HAVE APPEARED IN THE COVER OF TIME IN 1925.
CHAPLIN ONCE ENTERED IN A CHARLIE CHAPLIN LOOK A LIKE CONTEST. CHAPLIN LOST THE CONTEST.
ON MARCH 9 1975 CHARLIE CHAPLIN WAS KNIGHTED IN ENGLAND BY QUEEN ELIZABETH II. 
CHAPLIN DIED ON CHRISTMAS ON DECEMBER 25 1977 IN VEVEY VAUD SWITZERLAND. HE DIED OF A STROKE IN HIS SLEEP AT THE AGE OF 88. ON MARCH 1 1978 HIS BODY WAS STOLEN BY A SMALL GROUP OF SWISS PEOPLE. THEY WERE TRYING TO GET MONEY FROM CHAPLIN S FAMILY. THIS PLAN DIDN T WORK. THE PERPETRATORS WERE CAUGHT AND CHARLIE S BODY WAS FOUND 11 WEEKS LATER NEAR LAKE GENEVA. HE WAS BURIED UNDER CONCRETE TO PREVENT FURTHER INCIDENTS.
CHEMISTRY
CHEMISTRY IS A BRANCH OF SCIENCE THAT DEALS WITH CHEMICAL ELEMENTS AND COMPOUNDS AND HOW THESE THINGS WORK TOGETHER. IT IS THE STUDY OF THE MATERIALS THINGS THAT MAKE UP OUR BODIES AND EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD AROUND US.
BEFORE 1600 PEOPLE STUDIED SUBSTANCES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THINGS SUCH AS TURN LEAD INTO GOLD BUT NO ONE MANAGED TO DO THAT. THIS WAS CALLED ALCHEMY. ALCHEMISTS SEPARATED THE AIR INTO MANY PARTS AND ISOLATED THE NOBLE GASES FROM IT. THEY ALSO PROCESSED SPECIAL MINERALS FROM A MINE IN SWEDEN TO GET RARE EARTH METALS. RADIOACTIVITY WAS ALSO DISCOVERED. TODAY CHEMISTS HAVE DISCOVERED 118 DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. SOME ARE VERY COMMON LIKE OXYGEN. MANY ARE VERY RARE AND EXPENSIVE LIKE PLATINUM. SOME CANNOT BE FOUND ON EARTH AND CAN ONLY BE MADE IN LABS LIKE RUTHERFORDIUM.
SINCE THE 1920S THE INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS HAS CHANGED CHEMISTS THEORIES ABOUT CHEMICAL REACTIONS. WITH SMALLER AND FASTER COMPUTERS CHEMISTS HAVE BUILT BETTER TOOLS FOR ANALYZING SUBSTANCES. THESE TOOLS HAVE BEEN SENT TO STUDY CHEMICALS ON MARS. POLICE ALSO USE THOSE TOOLS TO STUDY EVIDENCE FROM CRIME SCENES.
THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES OF CHEMISTRY. ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY LOOKS AT WHICH CHEMICALS ARE IN THINGS. FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING AT HOW MUCH ARSENIC IS IN FOOD. ORGANIC CHEMISTRY LOOKS AT THINGS THAT HAVE CARBON IN THEM. FOR EXAMPLE MAKING ACETYLENE. INORGANIC CHEMISTRY LOOKS AT THINGS THAT DO NOT HAVE CARBON IN THEM. ONE EXAMPLE IS MAKING AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT.
A LARGE AREA OF CHEMISTRY IS POLYMER CHEMISTRY. THIS LOOKS AT PLASTICS. ONE EXAMPLE IS MAKING NYLON. BECAUSE PLASTICS ARE MADE OF CARBON POLYMER CHEMISTRY IS PART OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY. ANOTHER AREA IS BIOCHEMISTRY. THIS LOOKS AT THE CHEMISTRY OF LIVING THINGS. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE SEEING HOW ARSENIC POISONS PEOPLE. BIOCHEMISTRY IS ALSO PART OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY. THERE ARE MANY OTHER SMALL BRANCHES OF CHEMISTRY.
THE BASIC UNIT OF AN ELEMENT IS CALLED AN ATOM. AN ATOM IS THE SMALLEST BUILDING BLOCK THAT YOU CAN CUT AN ELEMENT INTO WITHOUT THE ELEMENT BREAKING DOWN TURNING INTO A LIGHTER ELEMENT FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH NUCLEAR FISSION OR RADIOACTIVE DECAY. A CHEMICAL COMPOUND IS A SUBSTANCE MADE UP OF TWO OR MORE ELEMENTS. IN A COMPOUND TWO OR MORE ATOMS ARE JOINED TOGETHER TO FORM A MOLECULE. THE TINIEST SPECK OF DUST OR DROP OF LIQUID THAT ONE CAN SEE IS MADE UP OF MANY MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF THESE MOLECULES. MIXTURES ARE SUBSTANCES WHERE CHEMICALS ARE MIXED BUT NOT REACTED. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE MIXING SAND AND SALT. THIS CAN BE UNDONE AGAIN TO PRODUCE SALT AND SAND SEPARATELY. CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS ARE CHANGED BY A CHEMICAL REACTION. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE HEATING SODIUM BICARBONATE COMMON BAKING SODA. IT WILL MAKE WATER CARBON DIOXIDE AND SODIUM CARBONATE. THIS REACTION CANNOT BE UNDONE.
ONE VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPT IN CHEMISTRY IS THAT DIFFERENT ATOMS INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER IN VERY SPECIFIC PROPORTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE TWO HYDROGEN ATOMS INTERACTING WITH ONE OXYGEN ATOM LEAD TO THE WATER MOLECULE HO. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS KNOWN AS THE LAW OF CONSTANT PROPORTIONS AND LEADS TO THE IDEA OF STOICHIOMETRY A TERM THAT REFERS TO THE RATIOS OF DIFFERENT ATOMS IN CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS. FOR EXAMPLE IN WATER THERE ARE ALWAYS EXACTLY 2 HYDROGEN ATOMS TO 1 OXYGEN ATOM. IN CARBON DIOXIDE THERE ARE EXACTLY 2 OXYGEN ATOMS FOR 1 CARBON ATOM. THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE DESCRIBED USING CHEMICAL FORMULAS SUCH AS HO TWO HYDROGEN ATOMS AND ONE OXYGEN ATOM AND CO ONE CARBON ATOM AND TWO OXYGEN ATOMS.
BECAUSE ATOMS OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS REACT WITH ONE ANOTHER IN VERY SPECIFIC PROPORTIONS BUT ATOMS OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS HAVE DIFFERENT WEIGHTS CHEMISTS OFTEN DESCRIBE THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS AND COMPOUNDS IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF MOLES. A MOLE OF ANY ELEMENT CONTAINS THE SAME NUMBER OF ATOMS 602 214 150 000 000 000 000 000 ATOMS. THE ATOMIC MASS OF AN ELEMENT CAN BE USED TO SEE HOW MUCH OF THE ELEMENT MAKES A MOLE. FOR EXAMPLE THE ATOMIC MASS OF COPPER IS ABOUT 63.55. THAT MEANS ABOUT 63.55 GRAMS OF COPPER METAL HAS A MOLE OF ATOMS. THE ATOMIC MASS OF CHLORINE IS ABOUT 35.45. THAT MEANS 35.45 GRAMS OF CHLORINE HAS A MOLE OF ATOMS IN IT.
MOLES CAN BE USED TO SEE HOW MANY MOLECULES ARE IN CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS TOO. COPPER II CHLORIDE IS AN EXAMPLE. CUCL IS ITS CHEMICAL FORMULA. THERE IS ONE COPPER ATOM 63.55 AND TWO CHLORINE ATOMS 35.45 2 70.90. ADD ALL THE MOLAR MASSES OF THE ELEMENTS TOGETHER TO GET THE MOLAR MASS OF THE CHEMICAL COMPOUND 63.55 70.90 134.45. THAT MEANS IN 134.45 GRAMS OF COPPER II CHLORIDE THERE IS ONE MOLE OF COPPER II CHLORIDE MOLECULES. THIS CONCEPT IS USED TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH CHEMICALS ARE NEEDED IN A CHEMICAL REACTION IF NO REACTANTS CHEMICALS THAT ARE REACTED SHOULD BE LEFT. IF TOO MUCH REACTANT IS USED THERE WILL BE SOME REACTANTS LEFT IN THE CHEMICAL REACTION.
ACIDS AND BASES ARE COMMON CHEMICALS. ACIDS RELEASE H IONS WHEN IN WATER AND BASES RELEASE OH IONS WHEN IN WATER. ACIDS CAN REACT WITH BASES. THE H ION IS TAKEN FROM THE ACID BY THE BASE. THIS MAKES WATER HO. A SALT IS ALSO MADE WHEN AN ACID AND A BASE REACT TOGETHER. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE REACTING HYDROCHLORIC ACID HCL AND SODIUM HYDROXIDE NAOH. HYDROCHLORIC ACID RELEASES H AND CL IONS IN WATER. THE BASE RELEASES NA AND OH IONS. THE H AND THE OH REACT TO MAKE WATER. THERE IS A SOLUTION OF SODIUM CHLORIDE NACL LEFT. SODIUM CHLORIDE IS A SALT.
CHEMISTRY IS VERY USEFUL IN EVERYDAY LIFE AND MAKES UP THE FOUNDATION OF MANY BRANCHES OF SCIENCE. MOST OBJECTS ARE MADE BY CHEMISTS PEOPLE WHO DO CHEMISTRY. CHEMISTS ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO FIND NEW AND USEFUL SUBSTANCES. CHEMISTS MAKE NEW DRUGS AND MATERIALS LIKE PAINTS THAT WE USE EVERY DAY.
MANY CHEMICALS ARE HARMLESS BUT THERE ARE SOME CHEMICALS THAT ARE DANGEROUS. FOR EXAMPLE MERCURY II CHLORIDE IS VERY TOXIC. CHROMATES CAN CAUSE CANCER. TIN II CHLORIDE POLLUTES WATER EASILY. HYDROCHLORIC ACID CAN CAUSE BAD BURNS. SOME CHEMICALS LIKE HYDROGEN CAN EXPLODE OR CATCH FIRE. TO STAY SAFE CHEMISTS EXPERIMENT WITH CHEMICALS IN A CHEMICAL LAB. THEY USE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT AND CLOTHING TO DO REACTIONS AND KEEP THE CHEMICALS CONTAINED. THE CHEMICALS USED IN DRUGS AND IN THINGS LIKE BLEACH HAVE BEEN TESTED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE SAFE IF USED CORRECTLY.
CHRISTMAS
CHRISTMAS WHICH MEANS CHRIST S MASS IS A HOLIDAY THAT IS CELEBRATED ON DECEMBER 25. IT IS A WORLDWIDE CULTURAL AND COMMERCIAL PHENOMENON. FOR TWO MILLENNIA PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN OBSERVING IT WITH TRADITIONS AND PRACTICES THAT ARE BOTH RELIGIOUS AND SECULAR IN NATURE. CHRISTIANS CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS DAY AS THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS OF NAZARETH A SPIRITUAL LEADER WHOSE TEACHINGS FORM THE BASIS OF THEIR RELIGION. POPULAR CUSTOMS INCLUDE EXCHANGING GIFTS DECORATING CHRISTMAS TREES ATTENDING CHURCH SHARING MEALS WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND OF COURSE WAITING FOR SANTA CLAUS TO ARRIVE. CHRISTMAS DAY HAS BEEN A FEDERAL HOLIDAY IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE 1870.
THE MIDDLE OF WINTER HAS LONG BEEN A TIME OF CELEBRATION AROUND THE WORLD. CENTURIES BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE MAN CALLED JESUS EARLY EUROPEANS CELEBRATED LIGHT AND BIRTH IN THE DARKEST DAYS OF WINTER. MANY PEOPLES REJOICED DURING THE WINTER SOLSTICE WHEN THE WORST OF THE WINTER WAS BEHIND THEM AND THEY COULD LOOK FORWARD TO LONGER DAYS AND EXTENDED HOURS OF SUNLIGHT.
IN SCANDINAVIA THE NORSE CELEBRATED YULE FROM DECEMBER 21 THE WINTER SOLSTICE THROUGH JANUARY. IN RECOGNITION OF THE RETURN OF THE SUN FATHERS AND SONS WOULD BRING HOME LARGE LOGS WHICH THEY WOULD SET ON FIRE. THE PEOPLE WOULD FEAST UNTIL THE LOG BURNED OUT WHICH COULD TAKE AS MANY AS 12 DAYS. THE NORSE BELIEVED THAT EACH SPARK FROM THE FIRE REPRESENTED A NEW PIG OR CALF THAT WOULD BE BORN DURING THE COMING YEAR.
THE END OF DECEMBER WAS A PERFECT TIME FOR CELEBRATION IN MOST AREAS OF EUROPE. AT THAT TIME OF YEAR MOST CATTLE WERE SLAUGHTERED SO THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE FED DURING THE WINTER. FOR MANY IT WAS THE ONLY TIME OF YEAR WHEN THEY HAD A SUPPLY OF FRESH MEAT. IN ADDITION MOST WINE AND BEER MADE DURING THE YEAR WAS FINALLY FERMENTED AND READY FOR DRINKING.
IN GERMANY PEOPLE HONORED THE PAGAN GOD ODEN DURING THE MID WINTER HOLIDAY. GERMANS WERE TERRIFIED OF ODEN AS THEY BELIEVED HE MADE NOCTURNAL FLIGHTS THROUGH THE SKY TO OBSERVE HIS PEOPLE AND THEN DECIDE WHO WOULD PROSPER OR PERISH. BECAUSE OF HIS PRESENCE MANY PEOPLE CHOSE TO STAY INSIDE.
IN ROME WHERE WINTERS WERE NOT AS HARSH AS THOSE IN THE FAR NORTH SATURNALIA A HOLIDAY IN HONOR OF SATURN THE GOD OF AGRICULTURE WAS CELEBRATED. BEGINNING IN THE WEEK LEADING UP TO THE WINTER SOLSTICE AND CONTINUING FOR A FULL MONTH SATURNALIA WAS A HEDONISTIC TIME WHEN FOOD AND DRINK WERE PLENTIFUL AND THE NORMAL ROMAN SOCIAL ORDER WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. FOR A MONTH SLAVES WOULD BECOME MASTERS. PEASANTS WERE IN COMMAND OF THE CITY. BUSINESS AND SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED SO THAT EVERYONE COULD JOIN IN THE FUN.
ALSO AROUND THE TIME OF THE WINTER SOLSTICE ROMANS OBSERVED JUVENALIA A FEAST HONORING THE CHILDREN OF ROME. IN ADDITION MEMBERS OF THE UPPER CLASSES OFTEN CELEBRATED THE BIRTHDAY OF MITHRA THE GOD OF THE UNCONQUERABLE SUN ON DECEMBER 25. IT WAS BELIEVED THAT MITHRA AN INFANT GOD WAS BORN OF A ROCK. FOR SOME ROMANS MITHRA S BIRTHDAY WAS THE MOST SACRED DAY OF THE YEAR.
IN THE EARLY YEARS OF CHRISTIANITY EASTER WAS THE MAIN HOLIDAY THE BIRTH OF JESUS WAS NOT CELEBRATED. IN THE FOURTH CENTURY CHURCH OFFICIALS DECIDED TO INSTITUTE THE BIRTH OF JESUS AS A HOLIDAY. UNFORTUNATELY THE BIBLE DOES NOT MENTION DATE FOR HIS BIRTH A FACT PURITANS LATER POINTED OUT IN ORDER TO DENY THE LEGITIMACY OF THE CELEBRATION. ALTHOUGH SOME EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT HIS BIRTH MAY HAVE OCCURRED IN THE SPRING WHY WOULD SHEPHERDS BE HERDING IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER POPE JULIUS I CHOSE DECEMBER 25. IT IS COMMONLY BELIEVED THAT THE CHURCH CHOSE THIS DATE IN AN EFFORT TO ADOPT AND ABSORB THE TRADITIONS OF THE PAGAN SATURNALIA FESTIVAL. FIRST CALLED THE FEAST OF THE NATIVITY THE CUSTOM SPREAD TO EGYPT BY 432 AND TO ENGLAND BY THE END OF THE SIXTH CENTURY. BY THE END OF THE EIGHTH CENTURY THE CELEBRATION OF CHRISTMAS HAD SPREAD ALL THE WAY TO SCANDINAVIA. TODAY IN THE GREEK AND RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCHES CHRISTMAS IS CELEBRATED 13 DAYS AFTER THE 25TH WHICH IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS THE EPIPHANY OR THREE KINGS DAY. THIS IS THE DAY IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE THREE WISE MEN FINALLY FOUND JESUS IN THE MANGER.
BY HOLDING CHRISTMAS AT THE SAME TIME AS TRADITIONAL WINTER SOLSTICE FESTIVALS CHURCH LEADERS INCREASED THE CHANCES THAT CHRISTMAS WOULD BE POPULARLY EMBRACED BUT GAVE UP THE ABILITY TO DICTATE HOW IT WAS CELEBRATED. BY THE MIDDLE AGES CHRISTIANITY HAD FOR THE MOST PART REPLACED PAGAN RELIGION. ON CHRISTMAS BELIEVERS ATTENDED CHURCH THEN CELEBRATED RAUCOUSLY IN A DRUNKEN CARNIVAL LIKE ATMOSPHERE SIMILAR TO TODAY S MARDI GRAS. EACH YEAR A BEGGAR OR STUDENT WOULD BE CROWNED THE LORD OF MISRULE AND EAGER CELEBRANTS PLAYED THE PART OF HIS SUBJECTS. THE POOR WOULD GO TO THE HOUSES OF THE RICH AND DEMAND THEIR BEST FOOD AND DRINK. IF OWNERS FAILED TO COMPLY THEIR VISITORS WOULD MOST LIKELY TERRORIZE THEM WITH MISCHIEF. CHRISTMAS BECAME THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN THE UPPER CLASSES COULD REPAY THEIR REAL OR IMAGINED DEBT TO SOCIETY BY ENTERTAINING LESS FORTUNATE CITIZENS.
CHRISTMAS TRADITIONS ARE OF SEVERAL TYPES. THERE ARE TRADITIONS OF THE CHURCH TRADITIONS WHICH ARE PUBLIC CELEBRATIONS AND TRADITIONS THAT ARE KEPT BY FAMILIES. THESE TRADITIONS ARE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT TIMES PLACES CULTURES AND EVEN FAMILIES.
THE CELEBRATION OF CHRISTMAS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TIME FOR CHURCHES. ALMOST EVERY CHURCH HAS SPECIAL SERVICES OR CELEBRATIONS. HERE ARE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT CHURCHES CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS.
IT IS THE CUSTOM IN MANY CHURCHES TO SET UP A CRIB OR CRECHE SCENE OF THE NATIVITY OR BIRTH OF JESUS. THE FIRST SCENE OF THIS TYPE WAS SET UP BY ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI IN THE 13TH CENTURY. THEY HAVE BEEN VERY POPULAR IN ITALY EVER SINCE THEN AND THE CUSTOM HAS SPREAD TO OTHER COUNTRIES.
NATIVITY SCENES CAN BE LARGE WITH LIFE SIZED STATUES OR THEY CAN BE TINY ENOUGH TO FIT IN A MATCHBOX. THEY ARE MADE OF MANY DIFFERENT THINGS INCLUDING CARVED AND PAINTED WOOD BRIGHTLY COLOURED CERAMICS POTTERY PAINTED PAPER GLUED TO BOARDS AND MIXTURES OF MATERIAL WITH CLAY WOOD CLOTH STRAW AND METAL USED FOR DIFFERENT PARTS.
THE ADVENT WREATH IS A CIRCLE OF LEAVES USUALLY PINE BOUGHS IVY AND HOLLY WITH 4 OR SOMETIMES 5 CANDLES IN IT WHICH IS HUNG UP IN A CHURCH. THE CANDLES ARE LIT ON EACH SUNDAY IN ADVENT AND THE CENTRAL CANDLE IS LIT ON CHRISTMAS MORNING. CHURCHES ARE OFTEN DECKED WITH GREEN BRANCHES AND LEAVES AND MANY CHURCHES ALSO HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE.
A POPULAR TRADITION IN MANY CHURCHES IS THE CAROL SERVICE WHICH IS OFTEN LIT ONLY BY CANDLES. THE CAROL SERVICE GENERALLY HAS LOTS OF SINGING AND BIBLE READINGS. THERE IS A TRADITION IN ENGLAND WHICH BEGAN IN THE TEMPLE CHURCH IN LONDON AND HAS NOW SPREAD TO MANY OTHER PLACES FOR A SERVICE OF NINE LESSONS AND CAROLS. THE LESSONS ARE BIBLE READINGS. SOME CAROLS ARE SUNG BY A CHOIR AND OTHERS BY THE CHOIR AND PEOPLE THE CONGREGATION. EVERY YEAR ONE OF THESE SERVICES IS RECORDED IN A LARGE ENGLISH CHURCH OFTEN KING S COLLEGE CHAPEL CAMBRIDGE AND IS BROADCAST ON RADIO AND TELEVISION TO BE ENJOYED BY PEOPLE WHO LOVE GOOD MUSIC AND CAROL SINGING BUT PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHO CANNOT GO TO A CHRISTMAS SERVICE.
MANY CITIES AND TOWNS CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS BY PUTTING UP DECORATIONS. THESE MAY BE BANNERS AND BUNTING WHICH ARE STRUNG FROM BUILDINGS OR LAMPPOSTS. THEY MAY BE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS WHICH CAN ALSO DECORATE BUILDINGS AND STREET TREES. MANY LARGE CITIES PUT UP A HUGE CHRISTMAS TREE IN A PUBLIC PLACE SUCH AS THOSE IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE IN LONDON TIMES SQUARE IN NEW YORK AND MARTIN PLACE IN SYDNEY. THIS IS OFTEN COMBINED WITH AN APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY TO GIVE MONEY OR GIFTS TO HELP THE POOR AND NEEDY.
IN MANY CITIES THE USUAL SHOPPING HOURS ARE MADE LONGER BEFORE CHRISTMAS SO THAT WORKERS HAVE MORE TIME TO BUY CHRISTMAS FOOD AND PRESENTS. SHOP WINDOWS ARE OFTEN DECORATED WITH CHRISTMAS SCENES WITH LARGE DEPARTMENT STORES OFTEN HAVING ANIMATED SCENES TO ENTERTAIN CHILDREN. SHOPPING MALLS AND BIG STORES OFTEN HAVE A SANTA CLAUS WHO SITS ON A THRONE WHILE CHILDREN TELL HIM WHAT THEY WANT FOR CHRISTMAS AND HAVE THEIR PHOTOS TAKEN.
MANY TOWNS HOLD CHRISTMAS PARADES STREET ENTERTAINMENT AND CONCERTS. SOME TOWNS HAVE A TRADITION OF CAROLS WITH A CHOIR AND ENTERTAINERS IN THE TOWN HALL WHILE IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND THESE CONCERTS OF CHRISTMAS ENTERTAINMENT AND CAROLS ARE USUALLY HELD OUTDOORS IN PARKS OR EVEN ON BEACHES WITH FAMILIES BRINGING PICNICS. THE ARRIVAL OF SANTA CLAUS AT THE END OF THE EVENING IS ACCOMPANIED BY A FIREWORK DISPLAY.
A TRADITIONAL PART OF CHRISTMAS IS THE THEATRE ENTERTAINMENT. THIS INCLUDES THE PERFORMANCE OF CLASSICAL MUSIC SUCH AS HANDEL S MESSIAH AS WELL AS ORCHESTRAL CONCERTS AND BAND RECITALS. PANTOMIMES ARE OFTEN PLAYED AT CHRISTMAS AND FAVOURITES INCLUDE PETER PAN AND WENDY AND CINDERELLA. MANY CHILDREN S MOVIES ARE RELEASED DURING THE CHRISTMAS SEASON.
BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE FEEL VERY LONELY HUNGRY AND SAD AT CHRISTMAS MANY CITIES CHURCHES CHARITIES AND SERVICE ORGANISATIONS TRY TO HELP THE POOR AND LONELY BY PROVIDING CHRISTMAS FOOD AND GIFTS FOR POOR FAMILIES AND CHRISTMAS PARTIES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HUNGRY OR WHO ARE LONELY AND WITHOUT ANY FRIENDS OR FAMILY.
FAMILY CELEBRATIONS ARE OFTEN VERY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER DEPENDING ON WHERE A FAMILY COMES FROM AND THE CUSTOMS THAT HAVE GROWN IN PARTICULAR FAMILIES.
MOST FAMILIES THINK OF CHRISTMAS AS A TIME TO GET TOGETHER WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY. PEOPLE OFTEN TRAVEL FROM FAR AWAY TO BE WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS AT CHRISTMAS. THOSE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT TRAVEL OFTEN MAKE LONG DISTANCE PHONE CALLS ON CHRISTMAS DAY. MANY PEOPLE ALSO SEE CHRISTMAS AS A TIME TO REACH OUT TO OTHERS THAT THEY KNOW MIGHT BE LONELY AND INVITE THEM TO DINNER ON CHRISTMAS DAY. CHRISTMAS IS SEEN AS A TIME FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES TO HAVE FUN TOGETHER FOR COUSINS TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER FOR GRANDPARENTS TO SEE THEIR GRANDCHILDREN AND FOR THE FAMILY TO ADMIRE THE BABIES THAT HAVE BEEN BORN DURING THE YEAR. BIG FAMILY PARTIES ARE USUALLY A TIME OF JOY BUT SOME FAMILIES OFTEN TALK ABOUT THEIR DISAGREEMENTS AND HAVE BIG FIGHTS AT CHRISTMAS TIME.
FAMILY TRADITIONS ARE VERY DIFFERENT. SOME FAMILIES MIGHT ALL GO OFF TO CHURCH TOGETHER TO A CAROL SERVICE A MIDNIGHT MASS OR A CHRISTMAS MORNING SERVICE. SOME FAMILIES ARE PULLED OUT OF BED VERY EARLY BY CHILDREN WHO WANT TO OPEN THEIR PRESENTS. IN OTHER FAMILIES PRESENTS ARE GIVEN ON ST. NICHOLAS DAY ON CHRISTMAS EVE OR NOT UNTIL AFTER CHURCH ON CHRISTMAS MORNING. THE CHRISTMAS FEAST MIGHT START ON CHRISTMAS EVE WITH A SPECIAL BREAKFAST ON CHRISTMAS MORNING OR AT MIDDAY ON CHRISTMAS DAY.
SOME FAMILIES HAVE A TRADITION OF CAROL SINGING AND MIGHT GO AROUND THE STREETS TO HOSPITALS AND OTHER SUCH PLACES SINGING WITH MEMBERS OF THEIR CHURCH. OTHER FAMILIES LIKE TO WATCH CERTAIN TELEVISION PROGRAMS TOGETHER WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE CAROL SERVICES AND THE QUEEN S MESSAGE. SOME FAMILIES USE CHRISTMAS AS A TIME TO PLAY MUSIC AND SING TOGETHER OR TO READ A FAVOURITE BOOK SUCH AS A CHRISTMAS CAROL BY CHARLES DICKENS. IN COUNTRIES IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE A VISIT TO THE BEACH OR A SWIM IN A POOL IS OFTEN PART OF THE CHRISTMAS DAY TRADITION.
CHRISTMAS DINNER USUALLY EATEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FAMILY CELEBRATION. THE FOOD DIFFERS FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND ALSO FROM FAMILY TO FAMILY. IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE ROASTED MEAT AND VEGETABLES IS GENERALLY THE MAIN COURSE OF THE MEAL. OFTEN SEVERAL TYPES OF MEAT ARE SERVED WHICH MAY INCLUDE TURKEY HAM ROAST BEEF OR LAMB. THERE ARE OFTEN SEVERAL COURSES WITH SPECIAL TREATS THAT ARE USUALLY ONLY EATEN AT CHRISTMAS.
IN ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES THE TRADITIONAL DESSERT IS CHRISTMAS PLUM PUDDING. NOWADAYS THESE ARE OFTEN BOUGHT FROM BAKERS BUT MANY PEOPLE MAKE THEIR OWN TO A FAMILY RECIPE. THE TRADITION CAME FROM THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN THE PUDDING WAS USED TO PRESERVE SOME OF THE FRUIT FROM THE AUTUMN UNTIL THE MID WINTER. A TRADITIONAL PUDDING IS BAKED SIX WEEKS BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND IS LEFT TIED UP IN A CLOTH IN A COOL PLACE. STIRRING THE PUDDING IS SOMETIMES A FAMILY TRADITION WITH EVERYONE MAKING A WISH AS THEY STIR. TRADITIONALLY A SILVER COIN WOULD BE STIRRED INTO THE PUDDING TO BRING LUCK TO THE PERSON WHO FOUND IT. NOWADAYS MOST COINS CANNOT BE USED BECAUSE THEY TASTE HORRIBLE AND MAY BE POISONOUS. SOME FAMILIES USE OLD COINS OR SILVER CHARMS. ON CHRISTMAS DAY THE PUDDING MUST BE BOILED IN A POT FOR SEVERAL HOURS. WHEN IT IS SERVED THE CLOTH IS CUT OFF BRANDY IS POURED ONTO THE PUDDING AND IS SET ON FIRE BEFORE IT IS CARRIED TO THE TABLE.
MANY FAMILIES HAVE A CHRISTMAS CAKE OR A SPECIAL BREAD INSTEAD OF A PUDDING OR AS WELL AS A PUDDING. THESE ARE VERY DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY BUT OFTEN HAVE MARZIPAN WHICH IS MADE FROM ALMONDS AND IS TRADITIONAL IN MANY COUNTRIES AT CHRISTMAS. IN FRANCE BUCHE DE NOEL OR GINGERBREAD MEN AND WOMEN ARE DECORATED AND HUNG ON THE CHRISTMAS TREE. IN SCOTLAND A PASTRY BISCUIT CALLED SHORTBREAD IS MADE AND HAS BECOME A POPULAR TRADITION IN MANY COUNTRIES. A GERMAN TRADITION IS PFEFFERNUSS SPICED COOKIES ROLLED IN POWDERED SUGAR. OTHER CHRISTMAS FOOD INCLUDES RAISINS SULTANAS GINGER TURKISH DELIGHT ALMONDS CHOCOLATES CARAMEL TOFFEE CANDY CANES AND ORANGES.
MANY FAMILIES ALSO PREPARE MULLED WINE WHICH IS WARMED WITH CINNAMON AND NUTMEG OR EGG NOGS A SWEET DRINK MADE OF MILK SUGAR EGGS NUTMEG AND SOMETIMES ALCOHOL.
IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE THE TRADITIONAL ROAST DINNER IS OFTEN REPLACED WITH COLD CUTS OF MEAT AND SERVED WITH SALADS. THE FIRST COURSE MIGHT BE PRAWN COCKTAIL OR A COLD SOUP LIKE BORSCH. THE PLUM PUDDING MIGHT BE SERVED WITH ICE CREAM. WHITE WINE AND BEER ARE BOTH SERVED COLD BEER IS KEPT IN A REFRIGERATOR. CHRISTMAS DINNER MAY BE SERVED ON THE VERANDA OR SOMETIMES AS A PICNIC.
IN MOST HOMES WHEN CHRISTMAS IS CELEBRATED PEOPLE SET UP A CHRISTMAS TREE IN THE HOUSE. THIS OLD YULETIDE CUSTOM BEGAN IN GERMANY AS THE TANNENBAUM GERMAN FOR FIR TREE. THESE ARE TRADITIONALLY EVERGREENS THE BEST TYPE BEING THE FIR TREE WHICH DOES NOT SHED ITS NEEDLES OR LOSE ITS FRAGRANCE. THE TREE MAY BE A CUT TREE THAT IS BOUGHT FROM A PLANTATION OR TAKEN FROM THE FOREST. ARTIFICIAL TREES ARE SOMETIMES PREFERRED TO REAL TREES. THE CHRISTMAS TREE IS DECORATED WITH LIGHTS SHINY COLOURED BALLS SPARKLY TINSEL AND OTHER ORNAMENTS. A WREATH OF LEAVES OR PINE IS OFTEN PUT ON THE FRONT DOOR OF A HOUSE AS A SIGN OF WELCOME. OTHER PLANTS THAT HAVE SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE AT CHRISTMAS ARE HOLLY WHICH IS USED AS DECORATION AND MISTLETOE WHICH IS HUNG IN THE CENTRE OF A ROOM. THE TRADITION IS THAT PEOPLE WHO MEET UNDER THE MISTLETOE MUST KISS.
MANY PEOPLE DECORATE THEIR HOMES AT CHRISTMAS TIME. THESE DECORATIONS AND THE CHRISTMAS TREE ARE GENERALLY INSIDE BUT MAY BE PUT WHERE THEY CAN ALSO BE SEEN THROUGH A WINDOW BY PEOPLE PASSING BY. IN THE MID 20TH CENTURY THERE GREW UP A CUSTOM FOR DECORATING THE OUTSIDE OF HOUSES AS WELL. THESE DECORATIONS MAY BE JUST A FEW LIGHTS AROUND THE PORCH OR HUNDREDS OF LIGHTS AND COLOURFUL CHRISTMAS FIGURES DECORATING THE WHOLE HOUSE AND GARDEN. SOME NEIGHBOURHOODS HOLD COMPETITIONS FOR THE BEST DECORATED HOUSE AND DRIVING AROUND THE STREETS TO LOOK AT THEM HAS BECOME ANOTHER FAMILY TRADITION.
THE GIVING OF GIFTS AT CHRISTMAS COMES FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT IDEAS. ONE IS THAT GOD GAVE HIS SON JESUS TO THE WORLD AT CHRISTMAS. THERE IS ALSO THE STORY OF THE WISE MEN WHO CAME TO THE BABY JESUS WITH THREE GIFTS GOLD FRANKINCENSE AND MYRRH. FOR MANY CENTURIES IT HAS BEEN THE CUSTOM FOR PEOPLE TO GIVE SMALL GIFTS AT CHRISTMAS AND ALSO TO GIVE GENEROUSLY TO THE POOR AND NEEDY TO HELP THEM THROUGH THE WINTER. ANOTHER TRADITION HAS BECOME LINKED TO THIS ONE AND THE RESULT IS THE TRADITION OF SANTA CLAUS OR FATHER CHRISTMAS AS HE IS SOMETIMES CALLED AND WHO IS NOWADAYS THOUGHT BY MANY CHILDREN TO BE THE BRINGER OF PRESENTS AND HAPPINESS.
IN THE 4TH CENTURY IN A GREEK VILLAGE THAT IS NOW PART OF TURKEY THERE WAS A GOOD MAN WHO WOULD SECRETLY GIVEN PRESENTS TO THE POOR TO HELP THEM. HE BECAME A BISHOP AND IS CALLED SAINT NICHOLAS. OVER THE CENTURIES HE BECAME A VERY POPULAR SAINT AND LOTS OF CHURCHES WERE NAMED AFTER HIM. HE WAS VERY POPULAR IN PLACES WHERE THERE WERE LOTS OF SAILORS. ONE OF THOSE PLACES WAS THE NETHERLANDS. IN THE NETHERLANDS AND MANY OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES PRESENTS ARE GIVEN ON THE FEAST OF SAINT NICHOLAS DECEMBER 6. TRADITIONALLY THE PRESENTS ARE NOT BIG AND ARE SOMETIMES HIDDEN OR HAVE A FUNNY JOKE OR POEM THAT MUST BE READ. IN MANY TOWNS OF EUROPE A MAN DRESSED IN BISHOP S ROBES COMES ON A HORSE OR IN A BOAT ACTING AS ST. NICHOLAS. HIS NAME WAS OFTEN SHORTENED TO SANTE CLAUS OR SANTA CLAUS IN ENGLISH.
IN ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES WHERE PRESENTS ARE USUALLY GIVEN ON CHRISTMAS DAY NOT DECEMBER 6 SANTA CLAUS OR FATHER CHRISTMAS IS USUALLY THOUGHT OF AS COMING ON THE NIGHT OF CHRISTMAS EVE WHEN HIS MAGIC SLEIGH IS PULLED ACROSS THE SKY BY REINDEER AND HE COMES INTO HOUSES THROUGH THE CHIMNEY OR THE FRONT DOOR. WHILE IN EUROPE CHILDREN PUT OUT THEIR SHOES FOR ST. NICHOLAS THE ENGLISH TRADITION IS TO HANG UP STOCKINGS OR LONG SOCKS IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE. SANTA CLAUS WOULD TRADITIONALLY FILL THE SOCKS OR SHOES WITH NUTS RAISINS CHOCOLATES AND AN ORANGE. NOWADAYS CHILDREN USUALLY GET MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE PRESENTS HAVE THEIR STOCKINGS FILLED WITH CANDY AND OR SMALL TOYS AND HAVE THE PRESENTS IN A BIG PILE UNDER THE CHRISTMAS TREE.
ANOTHER CHRISTMAS TRADITION IS THE SENDING OF CHRISTMAS CARDS TO FRIENDS AND RELATIVES. THESE CONTAIN WARM GREETINGS AND MAY ALSO HAVE A LETTER TELLING ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO THE PERSON OR FAMILY DURING THE YEAR.
CITY
A CITY IS A PLACE WHERE MANY PEOPLE LIVE TOGETHER. 
A CITY HAS MANY BUILDINGS AND STREETS. IT HAS HOUSES OR APARTMENTS FOR MANY PEOPLE TO LIVE SHOPS WHERE THEY MAY BUY THINGS PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO WORK AND A GOVERNMENT ORGANISATION TO RUN THE CITY AND TO KEEP LAW AND ORDER IN THE CITY. PEOPLE LIVE IN CITIES BECAUSE IT IS EASY FOR THEM TO FIND AND DO THE THINGS THEY WANT THERE. A CITY USUALLY HAS A CITY CENTRE WHERE GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS TAKE PLACE AND PLACES CALLED SUBURBS WHERE PEOPLE LIVE AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE CENTRE.
THERE IS NO RULE THAT IS USED ALL OVER THE WORLD TO DECIDE WHY SOME PLACES ARE CALLED CITY AND OTHER PLACES ARE CALLED TOWN. 
SOME THINGS THAT MAKE A CITY ARE 
IN AMERICAN ENGLISH PEOPLE OFTEN CALL ALL PLACES WHERE MANY PEOPLE LIVE CITIES. SEE BELOW SIZE OF CITIES 
THE SIZES OF CITIES CAN BE VERY DIFFERENT. THIS DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF CITY THAT IT IS. CITIES THAT WERE BUILT HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO AND WHICH HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH ARE VERY MUCH SMALLER THAN MODERN CITIES. THERE ARE TWO MAIN REASONS. ONE REASON IS THAT OLD CITIES OFTEN HAVE A CITY WALL AND MOST OF THE CITY IS INSIDE IT. ANOTHER IMPORTANT REASON IS THAT THE STREETS IN OLD CITIES ARE OFTEN NARROW. IF THE CITY GOT TOO BIG IT WAS HARD FOR A CART CARRYING FOOD TO GET TO THE MARKET PLACE. PEOPLE IN CITIES NEED FOOD AND THE FOOD ALWAYS HAS TO COME FROM OUTSIDE THE CITY. CITIES THAT WERE ON A RIVER LIKE LONDON COULD GROW MUCH BIGGER THAN CITIES THAT WERE ON A MOUNTAIN LIKE SIENNA IN ITALY BECAUSE THE RIVER MADE A TRANSPORT ROUTE FOR CARRYING FOOD AND OTHER GOODS AS WELL AS FOR TRANSPORTING PEOPLE. LONDON HAS BEEN CHANGING CONTINUALLY FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS WHILE SIENA WHICH WAS A VERY IMPORTANT CITY IN THE 1300S HAS CHANGED VERY LITTLE IN 700 YEARS. MODERN CITIES WITH MODERN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS CAN GROW VERY LARGE BECAUSE THE STREETS ARE WIDE ENOUGH FOR CARS BUSES AND TRUCKS AND THERE ARE OFTEN RAILWAY LINES AS WELL.
IN THE US THE WORD CITY IS OFTEN USED FOR TOWNS THAT ARE NOT VERY BIG. WHEN THE FIRST EUROPEAN PEOPLE WENT TO AMERICA THEY GAVE THE NAME CITY TO NEW PLACES. THEY HOPED THE PLACES WOULD BE GREAT CITIES IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE SALT LAKE CITY WAS THE NAME GIVEN TO A VILLAGE OF 148 PEOPLE. WHEN THEY STARTED BUILDING THE TOWN THEY MADE STREET PLANS AND CALLED IT GREAT SALT LAKE CITY FOR THE NEARBY GREAT SALT LAKE. NOW 150 YEARS LATER IT REALLY IS A BIG CITY. 
IN MODERN TIMES MANY CITIES HAVE GROWN BIGGER AND BIGGER. THE WHOLE AREA IS OFTEN CALLED A METROPOLIS AND CAN SOMETIMES INCLUDES SEVERAL SMALL ANCIENT TOWNS AND VILLAGES. THE METROPOLIS OF LONDON INCLUDES THE CITY OF LONDON THE CITY OF WESTMINSTER AND MANY OLD VILLAGES SUCH AS NOTTING HILL SOUTHWARK RICHMOND GREENWICH AND ETC. THE PART THAT IS OFFICIALLY KNOWN AS THE CITY OF LONDON ONLY TAKES UP ONE SQUARE MILE. THE REST IS KNOWN AS GREATER LONDON. MANY OTHER CITIES HAVE GROWN IN THE SAME WAY. 
THESE GIANT CITIES CAN BE EXCITING PLACES TO LIVE AND MANY PEOPLE CAN FIND GOOD JOBS THERE BUT MODERN CITIES ALSO HAVE MANY PROBLEMS. MANY PEOPLE CANNOT FIND JOBS IN THE CITIES AND HAVE TO GET MONEY BY BEGGING OR BY CRIME. CARS FACTORIES AND WASTE CREATE A LOT OF POLLUTION THAT MAKES PEOPLE SICK. THE SMALLEST CITY IS URBAN HISTORY 
URBAN HISTORY IS HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION. THE FIRST CITIES WERE MADE IN ANCIENT TIMES AS SOON AS PEOPLE BEGAN TO CREATE CIVILIZATION. FAMOUS ANCIENT CITIES WHICH FELL TO RUINS INCLUDED BABYLON TROY MYCENAE AND MOHENJO DARO.
BENARES IN NORTHERN INDIA IS ONE AMONG THE ANCIENT CITIES WHICH HAS A HISTORY OF MORE 3000 YEARS. OTHER CITIES THAT HAVE EXISTED SINCE ANCIENT TIMES ARE ATHENS IN GREECE ROME AND VOLTERRA IN ITALY ALEXANDRIA IN EGYPT AND YORK IN ENGLAND.
IN EUROPE IN THE MIDDLE AGES BEING A CITY WAS A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE GRANTED BY NOBILITY. CITIES THAT FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY USUALLY HAD OR STILL HAVE CITY WALLS. THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITY WERE PRIVILEGED OVER THOSE WHO DID NOT. MEDIEVAL CITIES THAT STILL HAVE WALLS INCLUDE CARCASSONNE IN FRANCE TEHRAN IN IRAN TOLEDO IN SPAIN AND CANTERBURY IN ENGLAND. 
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM A CITY IS A TOWN WHICH PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS CALLED A CITY OR WHICH HAS GOT THE NAME CITY STATUS BY ROYAL CHARTER A SPECIAL PAPER FROM THE KING OR QUEEN. CITIES USUALLY GET THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SPECIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE OR ARE IMPORTANT. IN THE PAST CITIES GOT THAT NAME IF THEY HAD A CATHEDRAL OR A UNIVERSITY. SOME CATHEDRAL CITIES FOR EXAMPLE ST DAVID S ARE SMALL AND PEOPLE DO NOT NORMALLY THINK OF THEM AS CITIES. CITIES THAT BECAME CITIES BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIVERSITY GENERALLY GROW BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE MOVE THERE TO BE EDUCATED AT THE UNIVERSITY COLLEGES. THE UNIVERSITY CITIES OF OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE ARE FAMOUS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE LARGEST CITY IS SHANGHAI WHILE THE FASTEST GROWING IS DUBAI. THE SMALLEST CITY IN THE UK IS WELLS.
THESE CITIES HAVE MORE THAN 10 MILLION PEOPLE 
CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY
CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY ALSO THE CLASSICAL ERA OR CLASSICAL PERIOD IS A BROAD TERM FOR A LONG PERIOD OF CULTURAL HISTORY AROUND THE MEDITERRANEAN. IT INCLUDES THE CIVILIZATIONS OF ANCIENT GREECE AND ANCIENT ROME KNOWN AS THE GRECO ROMAN WORLD. 
CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY IS THE PERIOD IN WHICH GREEK AND ROMAN LITERATURE SUCH AS AESCHYLUS OVID AND OTHERS FLOURISHED. BY CONVENTION THE PERIOD STARTS WITH THE WORKS OF HOMER 8TH 7TH CENTURY BC AND ENDS WITH THE ARRIVAL OF CHRISTIANITY AND THE DECLINE OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 5TH 6TH CENTURY AD.
THE EARLIEST PERIOD OF CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY TOOK PLACE BEFORE THE RE APPEARANCE OF HISTORICAL SOURCES AFTER THE BRONZE AGE COLLAPSE. THE EARLIEST GREEK ALPHABETIC INSCRIPTIONS ARE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 8TH CENTURY. HOMER IS USUALLY ASSUMED TO HAVE LIVED IN THE 8TH OR 7TH CENTURY AND HIS LIFETIME IS OFTEN TAKEN AS MARKING THE BEGINNING OF CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY. THE TRADITIONAL DATE FOR THE FIRST ANCIENT OLYMPIC GAMES IN 776 BC WAS ALSO AROUND THIS TIME. IN ROMAN LEGEND THE CITY OF ROME WAS FOUNDED IN 753 BC. THE EARLIEST SETTLEMENT AT THE ROMAN FORUM SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE AROUND THIS TIME. 
THE PHOENICIANS ORIGINALLY EXPANDED FROM LEVANTINE PORTS BY THE 8TH CENTURY DOMINATING TRADE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. CARTHAGE WAS FOUNDED IN 814 BC AND THE CARTHAGINIANS BY 700 BC HAD FIRMLY ESTABLISHED STRONGHOLDS IN SICILY ITALY AND SARDINIA WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH ETRURIA.
THE ARCHAIC PERIOD FOLLOWED THE GREEK DARK AGES AND SAW THE RISE OF DEMOCRACY PHILOSOPHY THEATRE POETRY AS WELL AS THE REVITALISATION OF THE WRITTEN LANGUAGE WHICH HAD BEEN LOST DURING THE DARK AGES.
POTTERY STYLES OF THE LATER PART OF THE ARCHAIC AGE ARE THE BLACK FIGURE POTTERY STARTED IN CORINTH DURING THE 7TH CENTURY BC. ITS SUCCESSOR WAS THE RED FIGURE STYLE DEVELOPED BY THE ANDOKIDES IN ABOUT 530 BC.
THE CLASSICAL PERIOD OF ANCIENT GREECE WAS FROM THE FALL OF THE ATHENIAN TYRANNY IN 510 BC TO THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT IN 323 BC. DURING THIS PERIOD CANE THE LONG STRUGGLE BETWEEN SPARTA AND ATHENS AND THE WARS BETWEEN THE GREEKS AND THE PERSIANS. THE RISE OF MACEDON IN THE 4TH CENTURY OVERTURNED ALL OTHER POLITICAL SYSTEMS AT LEAST FOR A WHILE.
THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD BEGAN WITH ALEXANDER WHEN GREEK BECAME THE LINGUA FRANCA FAR BEYOND GREECE ITSELF AND HELLENISTIC CULTURE CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE CULTURES OF PERSIA CENTRAL ASIA INDIA AND EGYPT. 
THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD ENDED WITH THE RISE OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC TO A SUPER REGIONAL POWER IN THE 2ND CENTURY BC AND THE ROMAN CONQUEST OF GREECE IN 146 BC.
THE ROMAN FORUM WAS THE CENTRAL AREA AROUND WHICH ANCIENT ROME DEVELOPED.
THE REPUBLICAN PERIOD OF ANCIENT ROME BEGAN WITH THE OVERTHROW OF THE MONARCHY AT ABOUT 509 BC AND LASTED OVER 450 YEARS UNTIL ITS SUBVERSION THROUGH A SERIES OF CIVIL WARS AND THE IMPERIAL PERIOD. 
DETERMINING THE PRECISE END OF THE REPUBLIC IS A MATTER OF DISPUTE. ROMAN CITIZENS OF THE TIME DID NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THE REPUBLIC HAD CEASED TO EXIST. 
IT COULD BE SAID THAT ROME WAS ALREADY OF IMPERIAL CHARACTER SINCE IT CONQUERED GAUL ILLYRIA GREECE AND HISPANIA AND THE ROMAN PROVICE ASIA.
DURING LATE ANTIQUITY CHRISTIANITY ROSE UNDER CONSTANTINE I AND FINALLY BECAME THE ROMAN IMPERIAL CULT IN 393. SUCCESSIVE INVASIONS OF GERMANIC TRIBES MEANT THE
THR END OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE IN THE 5TH CENTURY BUT THE EASTERN EMPIRE PERSISTED THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE AGES AS THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE.
RESPECT FOR THE ANCIENTS OF GREECE AND ROME AFFECTED POLITICS PHILOSOPHY SCULPTURE LITERATURE THEATER EDUCATION ARCHITECTURE AND EVEN SEXUALITY.
IN POLITICS THE PRESENCE OF A ROMAN EMPEROR WAS FELT TO BE DESIRABLE LONG AFTER THE EMPIRE FELL. THIS TENDENCY REACHED ITS PEAK WHEN CHARLEMAGNE WAS CROWNED ROMAN EMPEROR IN THE YEAR 800 AN ACT WHICH LED TO THE FORMATION OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE. THE NOTION THAT AN EMPEROR IS A MONARCH WHO OUTRANKS A MERE KING DATES FROM THIS PERIOD. IN THIS POLITICAL IDEAL THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE A ROMAN EMPIRE A STATE WHOSE JURISDICTION EXTENDED TO THE ENTIRE CIVILIZED WESTERN WORLD.
CLOUD
A CLOUD IS WATER VAPOUR IN THE ATMOSPHERE SKY THAT HAS CONDENSED INTO VERY SMALL WATER DROPLETS OR ICE CRYSTALS THAT APPEAR IN VISIBLE SHAPES OR FORMATIONS ABOVE THE GROUND.
WATER ON THE EARTH EVAPORATES TURNS INTO AN INVISIBLE GAS AND RISES UP INTO THE SKY. HIGHER UP WHERE THE AIR IS COLDER THE WATER CONDENSES IT CHANGES FROM A GAS TO DROPS OF WATER OR CRYSTALS OF ICE. WE SEE THESE DROPS OF WATER AS CLOUDS. THE DROPS FALL BACK DOWN TO EARTH AS RAIN AND THEN THE WATER EVAPORATES AGAIN. THIS IS CALLED THE WATER CYCLE.
THE ATMOSPHERE ALWAYS HAS SOME WATER VAPOUR. CLOUDS FORM WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE CAN NO LONGER HOLD ALL THE INVISIBLE AIR VAPOR. ANY MORE WATER VAPOR CONDENSES INTO VERY SMALL WATER DROPS.
WARM AIR HOLDS MORE WATER VAPOR THAN COOL AIR. SO IF WARM AIR WITH LOTS OF WATER INSIDE COOLS IT CAN FORM A CLOUD. THESE ARE WAYS AIR CAN COOL ENOUGH TO FORM CLOUDS 
CLOUDS ARE NOT HEAVY. THE WATER IN A CLOUD CAN HAVE A MASS OF SEVERAL MILLION TONS. EVERY CUBIC METRE M3 OF THE CLOUD HAS ONLY ABOUT 5 GRAMS OF WATER IN IT. CLOUD DROPLETS ARE ALSO ABOUT 1000 TIMES HEAVIER THAN EVAPORATED WATER SO THEY ARE MUCH HEAVIER THAN AIR. THEY DO NOT FALL BUT STAY IN THE AIR BECAUSE THERE IS WARM AIR ALL ROUND THE HEAVIER WATER DROPLETS. WHEN WATER CHANGES FROM GAS TO DROPLETS THIS MAKES HEAT. BECAUSE THE DROPLETS ARE VERY SMALL THEY STICK TO THE WARM AIR.
SOMETIMES CLOUDS APPEAR TO BE BRILLIANT COLORS AT SUNRISE OR SUNSET. THIS IS DUE TO DUST PARTICLES IN THE AIR.
CLOUDS ARE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO HOW THEY LOOK AND HOW HIGH THE BASE OF THE CLOUD IS IN THE SKY. THIS SYSTEM WAS SUGGESTED IN 1803. THERE ARE DIFFERENT SORTS OF CLOUDS BECAUSE THE AIR WHERE THEY FORM CAN BE STILL OR MOVING FORWARD OR UP AND DOWN AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS. VERY THICK CLOUDS WITH LARGE ENOUGH WATER DROPLETS CAN MAKE RAIN OR SNOW AND THE BIGGEST CLOUDS CAN MAKE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.
THERE ARE FIVE BASIC FAMILIES OF CLOUDS BASED ON HOW THEY LOOK 
THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE MAIN CLOUD TYPES ARRANGED BY HOW HIGH THEY FORM 
HIGH CLOUDS FORM FROM IN COLD PLACES IN MILD REGIONS AND IN THE VERY HOT TROPICS. THEY ARE TOO HIGH AND THIN TO PRODUCE RAIN OR SNOW.
HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS INCLUDE 
MIDDLE CLOUDS USUALLY FORM AT IN COLDER AREAS. HOWEVER THEY MAY FORM AS HIGH AS IN THE TROPICS WHERE IT S VERY WARM ALL YEAR. MIDDLE CLOUDS ARE USUALLY MADE OF WATER DROPLETS BUT MAY ALSO HAVE SOME ICE CRYSTALS. THEY OCCASIONALLY PRODUCE RAIN OR SNOW THAT USUALLY EVAPORATES BEFORE REACHING THE GROUND.
MEDIUM LEVEL CLOUDS INCLUDE 
LOW LEVEL CLOUDS ARE USUALLY SEEN FROM NEAR GROUND LEVEL TO AS HIGH AS. LOW CLOUDS ARE USUALLY MADE OF WATER DROPLETS AND MAY OCCASIONALLY PRODUCE VERY LIGHT RAIN DRIZZLE OR SNOW.
LOW LEVEL CLOUDS INCLUDE 
WHEN VERY LOW STRATUS CLOUD TOUCHES THE GROUND IT IS CALLED FOG.
THESE ARE CLOUDS OF MEDIUM THICKNESS THAT CAN FORM ANYWHERE FROM NEAR GROUND LEVEL TO AS HIGH AS. MEDIUM LEVEL CUMULUS DOES NOT HAVE ALTO ADDED TO ITS NAME. THE TOPS OF THESE CLOUDS ARE USUALLY NOT MUCH HIGHER THAN. VERTICAL CLOUDS OFTEN CREATE RAIN AND SNOW. THEY ARE MADE MOSTLY OF WATER DROPLETS BUT WHEN THEY PUSH UP THROUGH COLD HIGHER LEVELS THEY MAY ALSO HAVE ICE CRYSTALS.
MODERATE VERTICAL CLOUDS INCLUDE 
THESE CLOUDS ARE VERY TALL WITH TOPS USUALLY HIGHER THAN. THEY CAN CREATE HEAVY RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS. CUMULONIMBUS THE BIGGEST CLOUDS OF ALL CAN ALSO PRODUCE THUNDERSTORMS. THESE CLOUDS ARE MOSTLY MADE OF WATER DROPLETS BUT THE TOPS OF VERY LARGE CUMULONIMBUS CLOUDS ARE OFTEN MADE MOSTLY OF ICE CRYSTALS.
TOWERING VERTICAL CLOUDS INCLUDE 
IN THE BIBLE CLOUDS ARE OFTEN A SIGN OF GOD S PRESENCE.
CLOUD COMPUTING
IN COMPUTER SCIENCE CLOUD COMPUTING DESCRIBES A TYPE OF OUTSOURCING OF COMPUTER SERVICES SIMILAR TO THE WAY IN WHICH ELECTRICITY SUPPLY IS OUTSOURCED. USERS CAN SIMPLY USE IT. THEY DO NOT NEED TO WORRY WHERE THE ELECTRICITY IS FROM HOW IT IS MADE OR TRANSPORTED. EVERY MONTH THEY PAY FOR WHAT THEY CONSUMED.
THE IDEA BEHIND CLOUD COMPUTING IS SIMILAR THE USER CAN SIMPLY USE STORAGE COMPUTING POWER OR SPECIALLY CRAFTED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY HOW THESE WORK INTERNALLY. CLOUD COMPUTING IS USUALLY INTERNET BASED COMPUTING. THE CLOUD IS A METAPHOR FOR THE INTERNET BASED ON HOW THE INTERNET IS DESCRIBED IN COMPUTER NETWORK DIAGRAMS WHICH MEANS IT IS AN ABSTRACTION HIDING THE COMPLEX INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE INTERNET. IT IS A STYLE OF COMPUTING IN WHICH IT RELATED CAPABILITIES ARE PROVIDED AS A SERVICE ALLOWING USERS TO ACCESS TECHNOLOGY ENABLED SERVICES FROM THE INTERNET IN THE CLOUD WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF OR CONTROL OVER THE TECHNOLOGIES BEHIND THESE SERVERS.
ACCORDING TO A PAPER PUBLISHED BY IEEE INTERNET COMPUTING IN 2008 CLOUD COMPUTING IS A PARADIGM IN WHICH INFORMATION IS PERMANENTLY STORED IN SERVERS ON THE INTERNET AND CACHED TEMPORARILY ON CLIENTS THAT INCLUDE COMPUTERS LAPTOPS HANDHELDS SENSORS ETC. 
CLOUD COMPUTING IS A GENERAL CONCEPT THAT UTILIZES SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE SAAS SUCH AS WEB 2.0 AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY TRENDS ALL OF WHICH DEPEND ON THE INTERNET FOR SATISFYING USERS NEEDS. FOR EXAMPLE GOOGLE APPS PROVIDES COMMON BUSINESS APPLICATIONS ONLINE THAT ARE ACCESSED FROM A WEB BROWSER WHILE THE SOFTWARE AND DATA ARE STORED ON THE INTERNET SERVERS.
CLOUD COMPUTING IS OFTEN CONFUSED WITH OTHER IDEAS 
CLOUD COMPUTING OFTEN USES GRID COMPUTING HAS AUTONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND IS BILLED LIKE UTILITIES BUT CLOUD COMPUTING CAN BE SEEN AS A NATURAL NEXT STEP FROM THE GRID UTILITY MODEL. SOME SUCCESSFUL CLOUD ARCHITECTURES HAVE LITTLE OR NO CENTRALISED INFRASTRUCTURE OR BILLING SYSTEMS INCLUDING PEER TO PEER NETWORKS LIKE BITTORRENT AND SKYPE.
THE MAJORITY OF CLOUD COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE CURRENTLY CONSISTS OF RELIABLE SERVICES DELIVERED THROUGH DATA CENTERS THAT ARE BUILT ON COMPUTER AND STORAGE VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES. THE SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WITH THE CLOUD APPEARING AS A SINGLE POINT OF ACCESS FOR ALL THE COMPUTING NEEDS OF CONSUMERS. COMMERCIAL OFFERINGS NEED TO MEET THE QUALITY OF SERVICE REQUIREMENTS OF CUSTOMERS AND TYPICALLY OFFER SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS. OPEN STANDARDS AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE ARE ALSO CRITICAL TO THE GROWTH OF CLOUD COMPUTING.
AS CUSTOMERS GENERALLY DO NOT OWN THE INFRASTRUCTURE OR KNOW ALL DETAILS ABOUT IT MAINLY THEY ARE ACCESSING OR RENTING SO THEY CAN CONSUME RESOURCES AS A SERVICE AND MAY BE PAYING FOR WHAT THEY DO NOT NEED INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DO NEED TO USE. MANY CLOUD COMPUTING PROVIDERS USE THE UTILITY COMPUTING MODEL WHICH IS ANALOGOUS TO HOW TRADITIONAL PUBLIC UTILITIES LIKE ELECTRICITY ARE CONSUMED WHILE OTHERS ARE BILLED ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS. BY SHARING CONSUMABLE AND INTANGIBLE COMPUTING POWER BETWEEN MULTIPLE TENANTS UTILIZATION RATES CAN BE IMPROVED AS SERVERS ARE NOT LEFT IDLE WHICH CAN REDUCE COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY WHILE INCREASING THE SPEED OF APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT.
A SIDE EFFECT OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT COMPUTER CAPACITY RISES DRAMATICALLY AS CUSTOMERS DO NOT HAVE TO ENGINEER FOR PEAK LOADS. ADOPTION HAS BEEN ENABLED BY INCREASED HIGH SPEED BANDWIDTH WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO RECEIVE THE SAME RESPONSE TIMES FROM CENTRALIZED INFRASTRUCTURE AT OTHER SITES.
CLOUD COMPUTING IS BEING DRIVEN BY PROVIDERS INCLUDING GOOGLE AMAZON.COM AND YAHOO AS WELL AS TRADITIONAL VENDORS INCLUDING IBM INTEL MICROSOFT AND SAP. IT CAN ADOPTED BY ALL KINDS OF USERS BE THEY INDIVIDUALS OR LARGE ENTERPRISES. MOST INTERNET USERS ARE CURRENTLY USING CLOUD SERVICES EVEN IF THEY DO NOT REALIZE IT. WEBMAIL FOR EXAMPLE IS A CLOUD SERVICE AS ARE FACEBOOK AND WIKIPEDIA AND CONTACT LIST SYNCHRONIZATION AND ONLINE DATA BACKUPS.
THE CLOUD IS A METAPHOR FOR THE INTERNET OR MORE GENERALLY COMPONENTS AND SERVICES WHICH ARE MANAGED BY OTHERS.
THE UNDERLYING CONCEPT DATES BACK TO 1960 WHEN EXPRESSED HIS OPINION THAT COMPUTATION MAY SOMEDAY BE ORGANIZED AS A PUBLIC UTILITY AND THE TERM CLOUD WAS ALREADY IN COMMERCIAL USE IN THE EARLY 1990S TO REFER TO LARGE ATM NETWORKS. BY THE TURN OF THE 21ST CENTURY CLOUD COMPUTING SOLUTIONS HAD STARTED TO APPEAR ON THE MARKET THOUGH MOST OF THE FOCUS AT THIS TIME WAS ON SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE.
AMAZON.COM PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLOUD COMPUTING WHEN UPGRADING THEIR DATA CENTERS AFTER THE DOT COM BUBBLE AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO THEIR SYSTEMS BY WAY OF AMAZON WEB SERVICES IN 2002 ON A BASIS. THEY FOUND THE NEW CLOUD ARCHITECTURE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT INTERNAL EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS.
2007 OBSERVED INCREASED ACTIVITY INCLUDING GOOGLE IBM AND A NUMBER OF UNIVERSITIES STARTING LARGE SCALE CLOUD COMPUTING RESEARCH PROJECT AROUND THE TIME THE TERM STARTED GAINING POPULARITY IN THE MAINSTREAM PRESS. IT WAS A HOT TOPIC BY MID 2008 AND NUMEROUS CLOUD COMPUTING EVENTS HAD BEEN SCHEDULED.
IN AUGUST 2008 GARTNER OBSERVED THAT ORGANIZATIONS ARE SWITCHING FROM COMPANY OWNED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ASSETS TO PER USE SERVICE BASED MODELS AND THAT THE PROJECTED SHIFT TO CLOUD COMPUTING WILL RESULT IN DRAMATIC GROWTH IN IT PRODUCTS IN SOME AREAS AND IN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN OTHER AREAS.
CLOUDS CROSS MANY COUNTRY BORDERS AND MAY BE THE ULTIMATE FORM OF GLOBALISATION. AS SUCH IT IS THE SUBJECT OF COMPLEX GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES WHEREBY PROVIDERS MUST SATISFY MANY LEGAL RESTRICTIONS IN ORDER TO DELIVER SERVICE TO A GLOBAL MARKET. THIS DATES BACK TO THE EARLY DAYS OF THE INTERNET WHERE LIBERTARIAN THINKERS FELT THAT CYBERSPACE WAS A DISTINCT PLACE CALLING FOR LAWS AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS OF ITS OWN AUTHOR NEAL STEPHENSON ENVISAGED THIS AS A TINY ISLAND DATA HAVEN IN HIS SCIENCE FICTION CLASSIC NOVEL CRYPTONOMICON.
ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS TO MATCH THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS US EU SAFE HARBOR PROVIDERS LIKE AMAZON WEB SERVICES USUALLY DEAL WITH INTERNATIONAL MARKETS TYPICALLY THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPEAN UNION BY DEPLOYING LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALLOWING CUSTOMERS TO SELECT THEIR COUNTRIES. HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL CONCERNS ABOUT SECURITY AND PRIVACY FOR INDIVIDUAL THROUGH VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL LEVELS FOR EXAMPLE THE USA PATRIOT ACT AND USE OF NATIONAL SECURITY LETTERS AND TITLE II OF THE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT THE STORED COMMUNICATIONS ACT.
IN MARCH 2007 DELL APPLIED TO TRADEMARK THE TERM CLOUD COMPUTING IN THE UNITED STATES. IT RECEIVED A NOTICE OF ALLOWANCE IN JULY 2008 WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CANCELED ON AUGUST 6 RESULTING IN A FORMAL REJECTION OF THE TRADEMARK APPLICATION IN LESS THAN A WEEK LATER.
IN NOVEMBER 2007 THE FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION RELEASED THE AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE ABBREVIATED AS AFFERO GPL AND AGPL A VERSION OF GPLV3 DESIGNED TO CLOSE A PERCEIVED LEGAL LOOPHOLE ASSOCIATED WITH FREE SOFTWARE DESIGNED TO BE RUN OVER A NETWORK PARTICULARLY SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE. ACCORDING TO THE AGPL LICENSE APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO RELEASE ANY CHANGES THEY MAKE TO AN AGPL OPEN SOURCE CODE.
CLOUD ARCHITECTURE IS THE SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE OF THE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS INVOLVED IN THE DELIVERY OF CLOUD COMPUTING E.G. HARDWARE SOFTWARE AS DESIGNED BY A CLOUD ARCHITECT WHO TYPICALLY WORKS FOR A CLOUD INTEGRATOR. IT TYPICALLY INVOLVES MULTIPLE CLOUD COMPONENTS COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER OVER APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES USUALLY WEB SERVICES.
THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE UNIX PHILOSOPHY OF HAVING MULTIPLE PROGRAMS DOING ONE THING WELL AND WORKING TOGETHER OVER UNIVERSAL INTERFACES. COMPLEXITY IS CONTROLLED AND THE RESULTING SYSTEMS ARE MORE MANAGEABLE THAN THEIR MONOLITHIC COUNTERPARTS.
CLOUD ARCHITECTURE EXTENDS TO THE CLIENT WHERE WEB BROWSERS AND OR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS ARE USED TO ACCESS CLOUD APPLICATIONS.
CLOUD STORAGE ARCHITECTURE IS LOOSELY COUPLED WHERE METADATA OPERATIONS ARE CENTRALIZED ENABLING THE DATA NODES TO SCALE INTO THE HUNDREDS EACH INDEPENDENTLY DELIVERING DATA TO APPLICATIONS OR USERS.
A CLOUD APPLICATION INFLUENCES THE CLOUD MODEL OF SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE OFTEN ELIMINATING THE NEED TO INSTALL AND RUN THE APPLICATION ON THE CUSTOMER S OWN COMPUTER THUS REDUCING SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE ONGOING OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT. FOR EXAMPLE 
A CLOUD CLIENT IS COMPUTER HARDWARE AND OR COMPUTER SOFTWARE WHICH RELIES ON THE CLOUD FOR APPLICATION DELIVERY OR WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR DELIVERY OF CLOUD SERVICES AND WHICH IS IN EITHER CASE ESSENTIALLY USELESS WITHOUT A CLOUD. FOR EXAMPLE 
CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE E.G. INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE IS THE DELIVERY OF COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE TYPICALLY A PLATFORM VIRTUALIZATION ENVIRONMENT AS A SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE 
A CLOUD PLATFORM E.G. PLATFORM AS A SERVICE THE DELIVERY OF A COMPUTING PLATFORM AND OR SOLUTION STACK AS A SERVICE FACILITATES DEPLOYMENT OF APPLICATIONS WITHOUT THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF BUYING AND MANAGING THE UNDERLYING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE LAYERS. FOR EXAMPLE 
A CLOUD SERVICE E.G. WEB SERVICE IS SOFTWARE SYSTEM S DESIGNED TO SUPPORT INTEROPERABLE MACHINE TO MACHINE INTERACTION OVER A NETWORK WHICH MAY BE ACCESSED BY OTHER CLOUD COMPUTING COMPONENTS SOFTWARE E.G. SOFTWARE PLUS SERVICES OR END USERS DIRECTLY. FOR EXAMPLE 
CLOUD STORAGE IS THE DELIVERY OF DATA STORAGE AS A SERVICE INCLUDING DATABASE LIKE SERVICES OFTEN BILLED ON A UTILITY COMPUTING BASIS E.G. PER GIGABYTE PER MONTH. FOR EXAMPLE 
TRADITIONAL STORAGE VENDORS HAVE RECENTLY BEGUN TO OFFER THEIR OWN FLAVOR OF CLOUD STORAGE SOMETIMES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR EXISTING SOFTWARE PRODUCTS E.G. SYMANTEC S ONLINE STORAGE FOR BACKUP EXEC. OTHERS FOCUS ON PROVIDING A NEW KIND OF BACK END STORAGE OPTIMALLY DESIGNED FOR DELIVERING CLOUD STORAGE EMC S ATMOS CATEGORICALLY KNOWN AS CLOUD OPTIMIZED STORAGE.
A CLOUD COMPUTING PROVIDER OR CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE PROVIDER OWNS AND OPERATES CLOUD COMPUTING SYSTEMS SERVE SOMEONE ELSE. USUALLY THIS NEEDS BUILDING AND MANAGING NEW DATA CENTERS. SOME ORGANISATIONS GET SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF CLOUD COMPUTING BY BECOMING INTERNAL CLOUD PROVIDERS AND SERVICING THEMSELVES THOUGH THEY DO NOT BENEFIT FROM THE SAME ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND STILL HAVE TO ENGINEER FOR PEAK LOADS. THE BARRIER TO ENTRY IS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIRED AND BILLING AND MANAGEMENT CREATES SOME OVERHEAD. HOWEVER SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND QUICKNESS ADVANTAGES CAN BE ACHIEVED EVEN BY SMALL ORGANIZATIONS AND SERVER CONSOLIDATION AND VIRTUALIZATION ROLLOUTS ARE ALREADY IN PROGRESS. AMAZON.COM WAS THE FIRST SUCH PROVIDER MODERNISING ITS DATA CENTERS WHICH LIKE MOST COMPUTER NETWORKS WERE USING AS LITTLE AS 10 OF ITS CAPACITY AT ANY ONE TIME JUST TO LEAVE ROOM FOR OCCASIONAL SPIKES. THIS ALLOWED SMALL FAST MOVING GROUPS TO ADD NEW FEATURES FASTER AND EASIER AND THEY WENT ON TO OPEN IT UP TO OUTSIDERS AS AMAZON WEB SERVICES IN 2002 ON A UTILITY COMPUTING BASIS.
THE COMPANIES LISTED IN THE COMPONENTS SECTION ARE PROVIDERS.
A USER IS A CONSUMER OF CLOUD COMPUTING. THE PRIVACY OF USERS IN CLOUD COMPUTING HAS BECOME OF INCREASING CONCERN. THE RIGHTS OF USERS IS ALSO AN ISSUE WHICH IS BEING ADDRESSED VIA A COMMUNITY EFFORT TO CREATE A BILL OF RIGHTS CURRENTLY IN DRAFT.
A VENDOR SELLS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT FACILITATE THE DELIVERY ADOPTION AND USE OF CLOUD COMPUTING. FOR EXAMPLE 
A CLOUD STANDARD IS ONE OF A NUMBER OF EXISTING TYPICALLY LIGHTWEIGHT OPEN STANDARDS THAT HAVE FACILITATED THE GROWTH OF CLOUD COMPUTING INCLUDING 
COFFEE
COFFEE IS A PLANT COFFEA AND THE NAME OF THE DRINK THAT IS MADE FROM THIS PLANT. THE COFFEE PLANT IS A BUSH OR TREE THAT CAN GROW UP TO TEN METERS ABOUT 32 FEET HIGH BUT IS USUALLY CUT SHORTER. COFFEE PLANTS ORIGINALLY GREW IN AFRICA AND NOW ALSO GROW IN SOUTH AMERICA CENTRAL AMERICA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA. THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT CROP FOR THE ECONOMIES OF MANY COUNTRIES.
THE DRINK IS MADE FROM THE SEEDS OF THE COFFEE PLANT CALLED COFFEE BEANS. COFFEE IS USUALLY SERVED HOT AND IS A POPULAR DRINK IN MANY COUNTRIES. COFFEE CONTAINS A CHEMICAL CALLED CAFFEINE A MILD DRUG THAT KEEPS PEOPLE AWAKE.
TO MAKE A DRINK FROM COFFEE BEANS THE BEANS MUST FIRST BE SPECIALLY PREPARED BY DRYING THE BEANS AND THEN ROASTING. THE BEANS ARE DRIED A SHORT TIME AFTER THEY ARE PICKED. THIS PRESERVES THEM AND MAKES THEM READY TO BE PACKED OR ROASTED. BEFORE THE BEANS ARE MADE INTO A DRINK THEY MUST ROASTED OR GROUND CRUSHED INTO TINY PIECES IN A COFFEE MILL. WHEN THE GROUND COFFEE IS PLACED INTO BOILING WATER THE FLAVOUR AND DARK BROWN COLOUR OF THE BEANS GOES INTO THE WATER. MAKING COFFEE IS CALLED BREWING COFFEE. THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS THAT COFFEE CAN BE BREWED.
THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES OF COFFEE PLANTS. THE COFFEA ARABICA THE MOST COMMON. MOST OF THE WORLD S COFFEE IS MADE FROM ARABICA BEANS AND THE COFFEA ROBUSTA WHICH IS EASIER TO GROW IN PLACES WHERE ARABICA WILL NOT GROW.
ROBUSTA IS CHEAPER AND HAS MORE CAFFEINE THAN ARABICA AND IT IS USED IN MANY COMMERCIAL COFFEE PRODUCTS. BUT ROBUSTA TASTES BITTER AND ACIDIC SO PEOPLE ONLY DRINK IT WITH OTHER THINGS. BETTER QUALITY ROBUSTAS ARE IN SOME ESPRESSO BLENDS.
IN THE PAST PEOPLE GAVE NAMES TO NEW ARABICA COFFEES FROM THE PORT THEY CAME FROM. THE TWO OLDEST ARABICA COFFEES ARE MOCHA AND JAVA. TODAY NAMES ARE MORE SPECIFIC. THEY TELL US THE COUNTRY REGION AND SOMETIMES EVEN THE PROPERTY WHERE THEY COME FROM.
SOME SORTS OF COFFEE TASTE BETTER IF THE BEANS ARE AGED. THIS MEANS THAT AFTER THEY ARE PICKED THE BEANS ARE DRIED AND THEN KEPT FROM THREE TO EIGHT YEARS. THIS AGING GIVES THE COFFEE A LESS ACIDIC TASTE. COFFEE THAT HAS BEEN AGED IS OFTEN MIXED OR BLENDED WITH OTHER COFFEE THAT IS NOT AGED.
ROASTING IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT STAGES IN MAKING COFFEE BEANS INTO COFFEE. WHEN A COFFEE BEAN IS ROASTED IT GROWS NEARLY TWO TIMES BIGGER AND CHANGES FROM GREEN TO YELLOW TO BROWN.
THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE COFFEE BEANS ARE ROASTED MAKES THE COFFEE TASTE DIFFERENT. SOME TYPES OF COFFEE SUCH AS MOCHA AND JAVA ARE ROASTED FOR A SHORT TIME. IT IS EASY TO TELL FROM THE FLAVOUR WHERE THE COFFEE IS FROM. WHEN COFFEE IS ROASTED FOR A LONG TIME IT IS HARDER TO TELL THE DIFFERENT TYPES APART. GREEN COFFEE BEANS CAN BE BOUGHT AND ROASTED AT HOME IN THE OVEN.
BEFORE THE COFFEE IS MADE INTO A DRINK IT IS GROUND IN A SMALL GRINDING MACHINE CALLED A COFFEE MILL. THE COFFEE MILL BREAKS THE BEANS INTO VERY SMALL PIECES. COFFEE IS TURNED INTO A DRINK IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS. FOR SOME WAYS OF MAKING COFFEE SUCH AS ESPRESSO IT IS BEST TO HAVE THE COFFEE GROUND INTO FINE POWDER BUT FOR OTHER TYPES OF COFFEE MAKING SUCH AS FILTERED COFFEE THE COFFEE IS IN LARGER PIECES TO STOP IT GOING THROUGH THE FILTER. FINELY GROUND COFFEE MAKES A STRONGER TASTE.
COFFEE IS MADE INTO A DRINK BY PUTTING THE COFFEE INTO BOILING WATER. THIS IS CALLED BREWING COFFEE. 
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO BREW COFFEE. FOUR OF THE MOST POPULAR ARE 
INSTANT COFFEE IS A VERY QUICK WAY TO MAKE A CUP OF COFFEE TO DRINK. IT IS MADE IN A FACTORY AND SOLD IN JARS OR PACKETS. FIRST STRONG COFFEE IS MADE USING GROUND COFFEE AND BOILING WATER. THEN THE COFFEE GROUNDS ARE FILTERED OUT. THE COFFEE LIQUID IS DRIED OUT UNTIL NOTHING IS LEFT EXCEPT GRANULES LITTLE CRUNCHY PIECES OR FINE POWDER. THIS IS THEN PUT INTO JARS OR PACKETS. AS SOON AS A SPOONFUL OF INSTANT COFFEE IS ADDED TO BOILING WATER IT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER TO MAKE COFFEE TO DRINK. THE TASTE CAN BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM FRESH COFFEE. PART OF THE REASON FOR THE DIFFERENT TASTE IS THAT ROBUSTA COFFEE BEANS ARE USUALLY USED FOR MAKING INSTANT COFFEE. ROBUSTA COFFEE BEANS DO NOT COST AS MUCH AS ARABICA.
THE UNITED STATES BUYS THE MOST COFFEE GERMANY IS NEXT. PEOPLE IN FINLAND DRINK THE MOST COFFEE FOR EACH PERSON. IN CANADA THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE SOME RESTAURANTS SELL MAINLY COFFEE THEY ARE REFERRED TO AS CAF S OR COFFEEHOUSES. CAF S OFTEN SELL FOOD BUT THE TYPE OF FOOD IS DIFFERENT FROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER.
IN SOME COUNTRIES FOR EXAMPLE THOSE IN NORTHERN EUROPE PEOPLE LIKE HAVING COFFEE PARTIES. AT THESE PARTIES PEOPLE HAVE COFFEE AND CAKE.
IN MANY COUNTRIES PEOPLE DRINK COFFEE AT WORK IN THE UNITED STATES AND ENGLAND FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE DRINK IT IN THE MORNING. IN OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS MEXICO PEOPLE DRINK IT IN THE EVENING TO HELP THEM STAY AWAKE.
COFFEE CONTAINS THE DRUG CAFFEINE. CAFFEINE IS A MILD STIMULANT WHICH HELPS TO KEEP PEOPLE AWAKE. CAFFEINE LIKE MANY DRUGS CAN BE ADDICTIVE AND CAN CAUSE HEALTH PROBLEMS.
SOME STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT THE HEALTH RISKS OF COFFEE. IN FEBRUARY 2003 THERE WAS A STUDY IN DENMARK OF 18 478 WOMEN TO FIND OUT IF COFFEE HAD AN EFFECT ON PREGNANCY AND BIRTH. IT WAS FOUND THAT IF A WOMAN DRANK BETWEEN FOUR AND SEVEN CUPS OF COFFEE A DAY IT DID NOT SEEM TO MAKE A BIG CHANGE TO THE NUMBER OF BABIES THAT WERE BORN DEAD STILLBORN. BUT THE WOMEN IN THE STUDY WHO DRANK EIGHT OR MORE CUPS OF COFFEE A DAY HAD THREE TIMES AS MUCH CHANCE OF HAVING A STILLBORN BABY.
FOR THIS AND OTHER REASONS SOME PEOPLE DRINK COFFEE SUBSTITUTES INSTEAD OR DECAFFEINATED COFFEE.
COMPUTER
A COMPUTER IS A MACHINE MOSTLY ELECTRONIC THAT IS ABLE TO TAKE INFORMATION INPUT AND PROCESS IT TO MAKE NEW INFORMATION OUTPUT. 
CALCULATING MACHINES ARE OLD IN THE HISTORY OF TECHNOLOGY. EARLY EXAMPLES ARE THE ASTROLABE AND THE ABACUS. TODAY A COMPUTER IS A PROGRAMMABLE MACHINE. THE TWO PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A COMPUTER ARE IT RESPONDS TO A SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION SET IN A WELL DEFINED MANNER AND IT CAN EXECUTE A PRERECORDED LIST OF INSTRUCTIONS A PROGRAM. THERE ARE FOUR MAIN PROCESSING STEPS IN A COMPUTER INPUTTING STORAGE OUTPUTTING AND PROCESSING.
MODERN COMPUTERS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM EARLY COMPUTERS. THEY CAN DO BILLIONS OF CALCULATIONS PER SECOND. MOST PEOPLE HAVE USED A PERSONAL COMPUTER IN THEIR HOME OR AT WORK. COMPUTERS DO MANY DIFFERENT JOBS WHERE AUTOMATION IS USEFUL. SOME EXAMPLES ARE CONTROLLING TRAFFIC LIGHTS VEHICLE COMPUTERS SECURITY SYSTEMS WASHING MACHINES AND DIGITAL TELEVISIONS.
A COMPUTER USER CAN CONTROL IT BY A USER INTERFACE. INPUT DEVICES INCLUDE KEYBOARD MOUSE BUTTONS AND TOUCH SCREENS. SOME VERY SOPHISTICATED COMPUTERS CAN ALSO BE CONTROLLED WITH VOICE COMMANDS OR HAND GESTURES OR EVEN BRAIN SIGNALS THROUGH ELECTRODES IMPLANTED IN THE BRAIN OR ALONG NERVES.
COMPUTERS CAN BE DESIGNED TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING WITH INFORMATION. COMPUTERS ARE USED TO CONTROL LARGE AND SMALL MACHINES WHICH IN THE PAST WERE CONTROLLED BY HUMANS. THEY ARE ALSO IN HOMES WHERE THEY ARE USED FOR THINGS SUCH AS LISTENING TO MUSIC READING THE NEWS AND WRITING.
MODERN COMPUTERS ARE ELECTRONIC COMPUTER HARDWARE. THEY DO MATHEMATICAL ARITHMETIC VERY QUICKLY BUT COMPUTERS DO NOT REALLY THINK. THEY ONLY FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THEIR SOFTWARE PROGRAMS. THE SOFTWARE USES THE HARDWARE WHEN THE USER GIVES IT INSTRUCTIONS AND GIVES USEFUL OUTPUT.
COMPUTER PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED OR WRITTEN BY COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS. A FEW PROGRAMMERS WRITE PROGRAMS IN THE COMPUTER S OWN LANGUAGE CALLED MACHINE CODE. MOST PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN USING A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE LIKE C JAVA AND FORTRAN. THESE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES ARE MORE LIKE THE LANGUAGE WITH WHICH ONE TALKS AND WRITES EVERY DAY. THE COMPILER TRANSLATES THE USER S INSTRUCTIONS INTO BINARY CODE MACHINE CODE THAT THE COMPUTER WILL UNDERSTAND AND DO WHAT IS NEEDED.
A COMPUTER IS A PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICE DESIGNED TO ACCEPT DATA PERFORM PRESCRIBED MATHEMATICAL AND LOGICAL OPERATIONS AT HIGH SPEED AND DISPLAY THE RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS ALL UNDER THE CONTROL OF SOFTWARE. MAINFRAMES DESKTOP AND LAPTOP COMPUTERS TABLETS AND SMARTPHONES ARE SOME OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMPUTERS. AN ELECTRONIC MACHINE WHICH HELPS IN SOLVING PROBLEMS QUICKLY AND EASILY. IT SOLVES PROBLEMS ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO IT BY THE COMPUTER USER CALLED PROGRAMS OR SOFTWARE. IT IS A DIGITAL MACHINE THAT USES BINARY DIGITS USED IN ALL FIELDS.
MOST HUMANS HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MATH. TO SHOW THIS TRY DOING 584 3 220 IN YOUR HEAD. IT IS HARD TO REMEMBER ALL THE STEPS PEOPLE MADE TOOLS TO HELP THEM REMEMBER WHERE THEY WERE IN A MATHS PROBLEM. THE OTHER PROBLEM PEOPLE HAVE IS THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THE SAME PROBLEM OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. A CASHIER HAD TO MAKE CHANGE EVERY DAY IN HER HEAD OR WITH A PIECE OF PAPER. THAT TOOK A LOT OF TIME AND MADE MISTAKES. SO PEOPLE MADE CALCULATORS THAT DID THOSE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER. THIS PART OF COMPUTER HISTORY IS CALLED THE HISTORY OF AUTOMATED CALCULATION WHICH IS A FANCY PHRASE FOR THE HISTORY OF MACHINES THAT MAKE IT EASY FOR ME TO DO THIS SAME MATHS PROBLEM OVER AND OVER WITHOUT MAKING MISTAKES. 
THE ABACUS THE SLIDE RULE THE ASTROLABE AND THE ANTIKYTHERA MECHANISM WHICH DATES FROM ABOUT 150 100 BC ARE EXAMPLES OF AUTOMATED CALCULATION MACHINES.
PEOPLE DID NOT WANT A MACHINE THAT WOULD DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. FOR EXAMPLE A MUSIC BOX IS A MACHINE THAT PLAYS THE SAME MUSIC OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SOME PEOPLE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEIR MACHINE TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS. FOR EXAMPLE THEY WANTED TO TELL THE MUSIC BOX TO PLAY DIFFERENT MUSIC EVERY TIME. THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO PROGRAM THE MUSIC BOX TO ORDER THE MUSIC BOX TO PLAY DIFFERENT MUSIC. THIS PART OF COMPUTER HISTORY IS CALLED THE HISTORY OF PROGRAMMABLE MACHINES WHICH IS A FANCY PHRASE FOR THE HISTORY OF MACHINES THAT I CAN ORDER TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS IF I KNOW HOW TO SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE. 
ONE OF THE FIRST EXAMPLES OF THIS WAS BUILT BY HERO OF ALEXANDRIA C. 10 70 AD. HE BUILT A MECHANICAL THEATER WHICH PERFORMED A PLAY LASTING 10 MINUTES AND WAS OPERATED BY A COMPLEX SYSTEM OF ROPES AND DRUMS. THESE ROPES AND DRUMS WERE THE LANGUAGE OF THE MACHINE THEY TOLD WHAT THE MACHINE DID AND WHEN. SOME PEOPLE ARGUE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST PROGRAMMABLE MACHINE.
HISTORIANS DISAGREE ON WHICH EARLY MACHINES ARE COMPUTERS. MANY SAY THE CASTLE CLOCK AN ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK INVENTED BY AL JAZARI IN 1206 IS THE FIRST KNOWN PROGRAMMABLE ANALOG COMPUTER.. THE LENGTH OF DAY AND NIGHT COULD BE ADJUSTED EVERY DAY IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGING LENGTHS OF DAY AND NIGHT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. SOME COUNT THIS DAILY ADJUSTMENT AS COMPUTER PROGRAMMING.
OTHERS SAY THE FIRST COMPUTER WAS MADE BY CHARLES BABBAGE. 
ADA LOVELACE IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE FIRST PROGRAMMER.
AT THE END OF THE MIDDLE AGES PEOPLE IN EUROPE THOUGHT MATH AND ENGINEERING WERE MORE IMPORTANT. IN 1623 WILHELM SCHICKARD MADE A MECHANICAL CALCULATOR. OTHER EUROPEANS MADE MORE CALCULATORS AFTER HIM. THEY WERE NOT MODERN COMPUTERS BECAUSE THEY COULD ONLY ADD SUBTRACT AND MULTIPLY YOU COULD NOT CHANGE WHAT THEY DID TO MAKE THEM DO SOMETHING LIKE PLAY TETRIS. BECAUSE OF THIS WE SAY THEY WERE NOT PROGRAMMABLE. NOW ENGINEERS USE COMPUTERS TO DESIGN AND PLAN.
IN 1801 JOSEPH MARIE JACQUARD USED PUNCHED PAPER CARDS TO TELL HIS TEXTILE LOOM WHAT KIND OF PATTERN TO WEAVE. HE COULD USE PUNCH CARDS TO TELL THE LOOM WHAT TO DO AND HE COULD CHANGE THE PUNCH CARDS WHICH MEANS HE COULD PROGRAM THE LOOM TO WEAVE THE PATTERN HE WANTED. THIS MEANS THE LOOM WAS PROGRAMMABLE.
CHARLES BABBAGE WANTED TO MAKE A SIMILAR MACHINE THAT COULD CALCULATE. HE CALLED IT THE ANALYTICAL ENGINE. BECAUSE BABBAGE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AND ALWAYS CHANGED HIS DESIGN WHEN HE HAD A BETTER IDEA HE NEVER BUILT HIS ANALYTICAL ENGINE.
AS TIME WENT ON COMPUTERS WERE USED MORE. PEOPLE GET BORED EASILY DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER. IMAGINE SPENDING YOUR LIFE WRITING THINGS DOWN ON INDEX CARDS STORING THEM AND THEN HAVING TO GO FIND THEM AGAIN. THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU IN 1890 HAD HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DOING JUST THAT. IT WAS EXPENSIVE AND REPORTS TOOK A LONG TIME. THEN AN ENGINEER WORKED OUT HOW TO MAKE MACHINES DO A LOT OF THE WORK. HERMAN HOLLERITH INVENTED A TABULATING MACHINE THAT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ADD UP INFORMATION THAT THE CENSUS BUREAU COLLECTED. THE COMPUTING TABULATING RECORDING CORPORATION WHICH LATER BECAME IBM MADE HIS MACHINES. THEY LEASED THE MACHINES INSTEAD OF SELLING THEM. MAKERS OF MACHINES HAD LONG HELPED THEIR USERS UNDERSTAND AND REPAIR THEM AND CTR S TECH SUPPORT WAS ESPECIALLY GOOD.
BECAUSE OF MACHINES LIKE THIS NEW WAYS OF TALKING TO THESE MACHINES WERE INVENTED AND NEW TYPES OF MACHINES WERE INVENTED AND EVENTUALLY THE COMPUTER AS WE KNOW IT WAS BORN.
IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY SCIENTISTS STARTED USING COMPUTERS MOSTLY BECAUSE SCIENTISTS HAD A LOT OF MATH TO FIGURE OUT AND WANTED TO SPEND MORE OF THEIR TIME THINKING ABOUT SCIENCE QUESTIONS INSTEAD OF SPENDING HOURS ADDING NUMBERS TOGETHER. FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY HAD TO LAUNCH A ROCKET SHIP THEY NEEDED TO DO A LOT OF MATH TO MAKE SURE THE ROCKET WORKED RIGHT. SO THEY PUT TOGETHER COMPUTERS. THESE ANALOG COMPUTERS USED ANALOG CIRCUITS WHICH MADE THEM VERY HARD TO PROGRAM. IN THE 1930S THEY INVENTED DIGITAL COMPUTERS AND SOON MADE THEM EASIER TO PROGRAM.
SCIENTISTS FIGURED OUT HOW TO MAKE AND USE DIGITAL COMPUTERS IN THE 1930S AND 1940S. SCIENTISTS MADE A LOT OF DIGITAL COMPUTERS AND AS THEY DID THEY FIGURED OUT HOW TO ASK THEM THE RIGHT SORTS OF QUESTIONS TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THEM. HERE ARE A FEW OF THE COMPUTERS THEY BUILT 
SEVERAL DEVELOPERS OF ENIAC SAW ITS PROBLEMS. THEY INVENTED A WAY TO FOR A COMPUTER TO REMEMBER WHAT THEY HAD TOLD IT AND A WAY TO CHANGE WHAT IT REMEMBERED. THIS IS KNOWN AS STORED PROGRAM ARCHITECTURE OR VON NEUMANN ARCHITECTURE. JOHN VON NEUMANN TALKED ABOUT THIS DESIGN IN THE PAPER FIRST DRAFT OF A REPORT ON THE EDVAC DISTRIBUTED IN 1945. A NUMBER OF PROJECTS TO DEVELOP COMPUTERS BASED ON THE STORED PROGRAM ARCHITECTURE STARTED AROUND THIS TIME. THE FIRST OF THESE WAS COMPLETED IN GREAT BRITAIN. THE FIRST TO BE DEMONSTRATED WORKING WAS THE MANCHESTER SMALL SCALE EXPERIMENTAL MACHINE SSEM OR BABY WHILE THE EDSAC COMPLETED A YEAR AFTER SSEM WAS THE FIRST REALLY USEFUL COMPUTER THAT USED THE STORED PROGRAM DESIGN. SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE MACHINE ORIGINALLY DESCRIBED BY VON NEUMANN S PAPER EDVAC WAS COMPLETED BUT WAS NOT READY FOR TWO YEARS.
NEARLY ALL MODERN COMPUTERS USE THE STORED PROGRAM ARCHITECTURE. IT HAS BECOME THE MAIN CONCEPT WHICH DEFINES A MODERN COMPUTER. THE TECHNOLOGIES USED TO BUILD COMPUTERS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE 1940S BUT MANY CURRENT COMPUTERS STILL USE THE VON NEUMANN ARCHITECTURE.
IN THE 1950S COMPUTERS WERE BUILT OUT OF MOSTLY VACUUM TUBES. TRANSISTORS REPLACED VACUUM TUBES IN THE 1960S BECAUSE THEY WERE SMALLER AND CHEAPER. THEY ALSO NEED LESS POWER AND DO NOT BREAK DOWN AS MUCH AS VACUUM TUBES. IN THE 1970S TECHNOLOGIES WERE BASED ON INTEGRATED CIRCUITS. MICROPROCESSORS SUCH AS THE INTEL 4004 MADE COMPUTERS SMALLER CHEAPER FASTER AND MORE RELIABLE. BY THE 1980S MICROCONTROLLERS BECAME SMALL AND CHEAP ENOUGH TO REPLACE MECHANICAL CONTROLS IN THINGS LIKE WASHING MACHINES. THE 1980S ALSO SAW HOME COMPUTERS AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS. WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE INTERNET PERSONAL COMPUTERS ARE BECOMING AS COMMON AS THE TELEVISION AND THE TELEPHONE IN THE HOUSEHOLD.
IN 2005 NOKIA STARTED TO CALL SOME OF ITS MOBILE PHONES THE N SERIES MULTIMEDIA COMPUTERS AND AFTER THE LAUNCH OF THE APPLE IPHONE IN 2007 MANY ARE NOW STARTING TO ADD THE SMARTPHONE CATEGORY AMONG REAL COMPUTERS. IN 2008 IF SMARTPHONES ARE INCLUDED IN THE NUMBERS OF COMPUTERS IN THE WORLD THE BIGGEST COMPUTER MAKER BY UNITS SOLD WAS NO LONGER HEWLETT PACKARD BUT RATHER NOKIA.
THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF COMPUTERS 
A DESKTOP COMPUTER IS A SMALL MACHINE THAT HAS A SCREEN WHICH IS NOT PART OF THE COMPUTER. MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEM ON TOP OF A DESK WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE CALLED DESKTOP COMPUTERS. LAPTOP COMPUTERS ARE COMPUTERS SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT ON YOUR LAP. THIS MAKES THEM EASY TO CARRY AROUND. BOTH LAPTOPS AND DESKTOPS ARE CALLED PERSONAL COMPUTERS BECAUSE ONE PERSON AT A TIME USES THEM FOR THINGS LIKE PLAYING MUSIC SURFING THE WEB OR PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.
THERE ARE BIGGER COMPUTERS THAT MANY PEOPLE AT A TIME CAN USE. THESE ARE CALLED MAINFRAMES AND THESE COMPUTERS DO ALL THE THINGS THAT MAKE THINGS LIKE THE INTERNET WORK. YOU CAN THINK OF A PERSONAL COMPUTER LIKE THIS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER IS LIKE YOUR SKIN YOU CAN SEE IT OTHER PEOPLE CAN SEE IT AND THROUGH YOUR SKIN YOU FEEL WIND WATER AIR AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. A MAINFRAME IS MORE LIKE YOUR INTERNAL ORGANS YOU NEVER SEE THEM AND YOU BARELY EVEN THINK ABOUT THEM BUT IF THEY SUDDENLY WENT MISSING YOU WOULD HAVE SOME VERY BIG PROBLEMS.
AN EMBEDDED COMPUTER ALSO CALLED EMBEDDED SYSTEM IS A COMPUTER THAT DOES ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY AND USUALLY DOES IT VERY WELL. FOR EXAMPLE AN ALARM CLOCK IS AN EMBEDDED COMPUTER IT TELLS THE TIME. UNLIKE YOUR PERSONAL COMPUTER YOU CANNOT USE YOUR CLOCK TO PLAY TETRIS. BECAUSE OF THIS WE SAY THAT EMBEDDED COMPUTERS CANNOT BE PROGRAMMED BECAUSE YOU CANNOT INSTALL MORE PROGRAMS ON YOUR CLOCK. SOME MOBILE PHONES AUTOMATIC TELLER MACHINES MICROWAVE OVENS CD PLAYERS AND CARS ARE OPERATED BY EMBEDDED COMPUTERS.
ALL IN ONE COMPUTERS ARE DESKTOP COMPUTERS THAT HAVE ALL OF THE COMPUTER S INNER MECHANISMS IN THE SAME CASE AS THE MONITOR. APPLE HAS MADE SEVERAL POPULAR EXAMPLES OF ALL IN ONE COMPUTERS SUCH AS THE ORIGINAL MACINTOSH OF THE MID 1980S AND THE IMAC OF THE LATE 1990S AND 2000S.
COMPUTERS STORE DATA AND THE INSTRUCTIONS AS NUMBERS BECAUSE COMPUTERS CAN DO THINGS WITH NUMBERS VERY QUICKLY. THESE DATA ARE STORED AS BINARY SYMBOLS 1S AND 0S. A 1 OR A 0 SYMBOL STORED BY A COMPUTER IS CALLED A BIT WHICH COMES FROM THE WORDS BINARY DIGIT. COMPUTERS CAN USE MANY BITS TOGETHER TO REPRESENT INSTRUCTIONS AND THE DATA THAT THESE INSTRUCTIONS USE. A LIST OF INSTRUCTIONS IS CALLED A PROGRAM AND IS STORED ON THE COMPUTER S HARD DISK. COMPUTERS WORK THROUGH THE PROGRAM BY USING A CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT AND THEY USE FAST MEMORY CALLED RAM AS A SPACE TO STORE THE INSTRUCTIONS AND DATA WHILE THEY ARE DOING THIS. WHEN THE COMPUTER WANTS TO STORE THE RESULTS OF THE PROGRAM FOR LATER IT USES THE HARD DISK BECAUSE THINGS STORED ON A HARD DISK CAN STILL BE REMEMBERED AFTER THE COMPUTER IS TURNED OFF.
AN OPERATING SYSTEM TELLS THE COMPUTER HOW TO UNDERSTAND WHAT JOBS IT HAS TO DO HOW TO DO THESE JOBS AND HOW TO TELL PEOPLE THE RESULTS. MILLIONS OF COMPUTERS MAY BE USING THE SAME OPERATING SYSTEM WHILE EACH COMPUTER CAN HAVE ITS OWN APPLICATION PROGRAMS TO DO WHAT ITS USER NEEDS. USING THE SAME OPERATING SYSTEMS MAKES IT EASY TO LEARN HOW TO USE COMPUTERS FOR NEW THINGS. A USER WHO NEEDS TO USE A COMPUTER FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT CAN LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW APPLICATION PROGRAM. SOME OPERATING SYSTEMS CAN HAVE SIMPLE COMMAND LINES OR A FULLY USER FRENDLY GUI.
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS THAT COMPUTERS DO FOR PEOPLE IS HELPING WITH COMMUNICATION. COMMUNICATION IS HOW PEOPLE SHARE INFORMATION. COMPUTERS HAVE HELPED PEOPLE MOVE FORWARD IN SCIENCE MEDICINE BUSINESS AND LEARNING BECAUSE THEY LET EXPERTS FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WORK WITH EACH OTHER AND SHARE INFORMATION. THEY ALSO LET OTHER PEOPLE COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER DO THEIR JOBS ALMOST ANYWHERE LEARN ABOUT ALMOST ANYTHING OR SHARE THEIR OPINIONS WITH EACH OTHER. THE INTERNET IS THE THING THAT LETS PEOPLE COMMUNICATE BETWEEN THEIR COMPUTERS.
A COMPUTER IS NOW ALMOST ALWAYS AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE. IT USUALLY CONTAINS MATERIALS THAT WILL BECOME ELECTRONIC WASTE WHEN DISCARDED. WHEN A NEW COMPUTER IS BOUGHT IN SOME PLACES LAWS REQUIRE THAT THE COST OF ITS WASTE MANAGEMENT MUST ALSO BE PAID FOR. THIS IS CALLED PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP.
COMPUTERS CAN BECOME OBSOLETE QUICKLY DEPENDING ON WHAT PROGRAMS THE USER RUNS. VERY OFTEN THEY ARE THROWN AWAY WITHIN TWO OR THREE YEARS BECAUSE SOME NEWER PROGRAMS REQUIRE A MORE POWERFUL COMPUTER. THIS MAKES THE PROBLEM WORSE SO COMPUTER RECYCLING HAPPENS A LOT. MANY PROJECTS TRY TO SEND WORKING COMPUTERS TO DEVELOPING NATIONS SO THEY CAN BE RE USED AND WILL NOT BECOME WASTE AS QUICKLY AS MOST PEOPLE DO NOT NEED TO RUN NEW PROGRAMS. SOME COMPUTER PARTS SUCH AS HARD DRIVES CAN BREAK EASILY. WHEN THESE PARTS END UP IN THE LANDFILL THEY CAN PUT POISONOUS CHEMICALS LIKE LEAD INTO THE GROUND WATER. HARD DRIVES CAN ALSO CONTAIN SECRET INFORMATION LIKE CREDIT CARD NUMBERS. IF THE HARD DRIVE IS NOT ERASED BEFORE BEING THROWN AWAY AN IDENTITY THIEF CAN GET THE INFORMATION FROM THE HARD DRIVE EVEN IF THE DRIVE DOESN T WORK AND USE IT TO STEAL MONEY FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNER S BANK ACCOUNT.
COMPUTERS COME IN DIFFERENT FORMS BUT MOST OF THEM HAVE A COMMON DESIGN.
A COMPUTER HAS SEVERAL MAIN PARTS. WHEN COMPARING A COMPUTER TO A HUMAN BODY THE CPU IS LIKE A BRAIN. IT DOES MOST OF THE THINKING AND TELLS THE REST OF THE COMPUTER HOW TO WORK. THE CPU IS ON THE MOTHERBOARD WHICH IS LIKE THE SKELETON. IT PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR WHERE THE OTHER PARTS GO AND CARRIES THE NERVES THAT CONNECT THEM TO EACH OTHER AND THE CPU. THE MOTHERBOARD IS CONNECTED TO A POWER SUPPLY WHICH PROVIDES ELECTRICITY TO THE ENTIRE COMPUTER. THE VARIOUS DRIVES CD DRIVE FLOPPY DRIVE AND ON MANY NEWER COMPUTERS USB FLASH DRIVE ACT LIKE EYES EARS AND FINGERS AND ALLOW THE COMPUTER TO READ DIFFERENT TYPES OF STORAGE IN THE SAME WAY THAT A HUMAN CAN READ DIFFERENT TYPES OF BOOKS. THE HARD DRIVE IS LIKE A HUMAN S MEMORY AND KEEPS TRACK OF ALL THE DATA STORED ON THE COMPUTER. MOST COMPUTERS HAVE A SOUND CARD OR ANOTHER METHOD OF MAKING SOUND WHICH IS LIKE VOCAL CORDS OR A VOICE BOX. CONNECTED TO THE SOUND CARD ARE SPEAKERS WHICH ARE LIKE A MOUTH AND ARE WHERE THE SOUND COMES OUT. COMPUTERS MIGHT ALSO HAVE A GRAPHICS CARD WHICH HELPS THE COMPUTER TO CREATE VISUAL EFFECTS SUCH AS 3D ENVIRONMENTS OR MORE REALISTIC COLORS AND MORE POWERFUL GRAPHICS CARDS CAN MAKE MORE REALISTIC OR MORE ADVANCED IMAGES IN THE SAME WAY A WELL TRAINED ARTIST CAN.
COPPER
COPPER IS A CHEMICAL ELEMENT. IT IS THE 29TH ELEMENT IN THE PERIODIC TABLE AND HAS 29 PROTONS. ITS MASS NUMBER IS 63.55. IT IS A TRANSITION METAL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PERIODIC TABLE. THE SYMBOL FOR COPPER IS CU WHICH COMES FROM THE LATIN WORD CUPRUM WHICH IN TURN CAME FROM THE LATIN WORD FOR THE ISLAND OF CYPRUS WHERE COPPER WAS FOUND. 
COPPER IS A PINKISH COLOUR WHEN IT IS NEW BUT SOON TURNS A REDDISH ORANGE COLOR AFTER IT IS EXPOSED TO AIR. 
COPPER IS ONE OF THE FEW COLOURED METALS. MOST METALS ARE GRAY OR SILVER. GOLD COPPER CAESIUM AND OSMIUM ARE THE ONLY FOUR COLOURED METALS. COPPER IS GREEN AS COPPER II CARBONATE AND COPPER II HYDROXIDE. IT TURNS GREEN BECAUSE IT OXIDISES. AFTER A TIME IN THE AIR COPPER FORMS GREEN COPPER CARBONATE AT THE SURFACE CALLED VERDIGRIS. THAT IS WHY THE COPPER ROOF OF A BUILDING LOOKS GREEN.
COPPER IS VERY FLEXIBLE AND DUCTILE. IT CAN BE STRETCHED INTO WIRES EASILY. COPPER IS ALSO VERY SOFT IT HAS A MOHS HARDNESS OF 2.5 TO 3. THAT MEANS THAT IT IS HARDER THAN A FINGERNAIL BUT SOFTER THAN A STEEL POCKETKNIFE. 
IT REACTS WITH SOLUTIONS OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID OR AMMONIA CONTAINING OXYGEN. IT CAN ALSO DISSOLVE IN A MIXTURE OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE AND HYDROCHLORIC ACID. THIS MAKES COPPER II CHLORIDE. IT DOES NOT DISSOLVE IN WEAK ACIDS. IT CAN DISSOLVE IN NITRIC ACID TO MAKE COPPER II NITRATE AND NITROGEN DIOXIDE OR NITRIC OXIDE.
COPPER FORMS CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS. IN THESE COMPOUNDS IT HAS TWO NORMAL OXIDATION STATES 1 AND 2. 2 IS MORE COMMON. MOST 2 COPPER COMPOUNDS ARE BLUE. 1 COPPER COMPOUNDS CAN BE WHITE. COPPER COMPOUNDS ARE WEAK OXIDIZING AGENTS. THEY CORRODE MANY METALS. THIS CORROSION TAKES THE METAL AND PUTS IT IN THE CHEMICAL COMPOUND LEAVING THE COPPER BEHIND. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE IRON AND COPPER II SULFATE REACTING TO MAKE COPPER AND IRON II SULFATE. 1 COPPER COMPOUNDS ARE REDUCING AGENTS WHEN IN AIR. THEY ARE NORMALLY MADE BY REDUCTION OF 2 COMPOUNDS.
COPPER COMPOUNDS CAN BE BLACK GREEN REDDISH WHITE BLUE OR YELLOW.
COPPER I COMPOUNDS HAVE COPPER IN 1 OXIDATION STATE. THEY ARE WEAK REDUCING AGENTS. THEY REACT WITH AIR TO MAKE COPPER II COMPOUNDS. THEY ALSO DISPROPORTIONATE TO COPPER AND COPPER II COMPOUNDS. MOST OF THEM DO NOT DISSOLVE IN WATER.
COPPER II COMPOUNDS HAVE COPPER IN 2 OXIDATION STATE. THEY ARE WEAK OXIDIZING AGENTS. THEY ARE GREENISH WHEN HYDROUS WATER MOLECULES ADDED. THEY ARE MORE STABLE IN AIR THAN COPPER I COMPOUNDS.
COPPER CAN BE FOUND AS A METAL IN THE GROUND. NORMALLY IT IS GREEN ON THE OUTSIDE. MOST COPPER IS NOT AS A METAL BUT IN CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS. CHALCOPYRITE IS THE MOST COMMON COPPER ORE. IT IS A MIXTURE OF PYRITE AND COPPER SULFIDE. COPPER IS FOUND IN SMALL AMOUNTS IN LIVING THINGS. SOME MOLLUSKS AND ARTHROPODS HAVE BLUE BLOOD BECAUSE THEY HAVE COPPER IN THEIR BLOOD. ANIMALS SUCH AS HUMANS AND OTHER MAMMALS HAVE RED BLOOD BECAUSE IT CONTAINS IRON.
COPPER CAN BE USED IN MANY WAYS BUT ONE EXAMPLE IS WIRES. COPPER IS USED IN MAKING WIRES AS IT IS EASY TO STRETCH AND IT IS NOT EXPENSIVE. SO THAT S WHY LARGE WIRE COMPANIES WILL USE COPPER AS IT IS CHEAPER AND TAKES LESS TIME TO GET
COPPER MAY BE THE OLDEST METAL IN USE AS VERY OLD COPPER TOOLS HAVE BEEN FOUND. COPPER IS USED IN ELECTRICAL WIRING. IT CAN ALSO BE SHAPED INTO VARIOUS PARTS. IT CAN BE USED IN A HEAT SINK. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY IS MADE OF COPPER. IT IS ALSO USED IN PIPES CARRYING WATER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CORRODE.
WHEN PEOPLE MIX COPPER WITH TIN BRONZE IS MADE. BRONZE IS AN IMPORTANT METAL BECAUSE IT CAN BE SHAPED INTO USEFUL THINGS BUT IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT BEFORE THE USE OF IRON. WHEN ZINC IS MIXED WITH COPPER BRASS IS MADE. IT CAN BE ALLOYED WITH NICKEL TO MAKE CUPRONICKEL.
COPPER IS IMPORTANT IN THE HUMAN BODY. IF A PERSON DOES NOT GET ENOUGH COPPER THE MOLECULES IN THE BODY MIGHT NOT WORK. HAVING TOO MUCH COPPER THOUGH CAN BE A PROBLEM. HUMANS GET MOST OF THE COPPER THEY NEED FROM FOOD AND VITAMINS ALSO CONTAIN COPPER TO MAKE SURE WE GET ENOUGH. COPPER COMPOUNDS ARE ALSO USED TO KILL FUNGI AND ALGAE.
COPPER IS NOT AS TOXIC AS A METAL. COPPER COMPOUNDS ARE TOXIC THOUGH ALTHOUGH SMALL AMOUNTS ARE NEEDED TO LIVE. COPPER IS EXPELLED FROM THE BODY EASILY SO IT DOES NOT BUILD UP IN TOXIC EFFECTS.
COPPER IS SOMETIMES JUST TAKEN OUT OF THE GROUND AND SHAPED INTO OBJECTS. BUT MOST COPPER IS NOT IN A METAL FORM IN THE GROUND. CHALCOPYRITE IS THE MAIN COPPER ORE. IT IS HEATED WITH AIR TO SEPARATE THE IRON AS IRON II OXIDE. SOME COPPER I OXIDE IS MADE. SULFUR DIOXIDE IS ALSO MADE. THEN SILICON DIOXIDE IS ADDED WHICH REACTS WITH THE IRON II OXIDE TO MAKE A LIQUID WHICH IS DRAINED. NOW ONLY COPPER AND SULFIDE ARE LEFT. THE COPPER SULFIDE REACTS WITH AIR TO MAKE COPPER METAL AND SULFUR DIOXIDE. SOME COPPER SULFIDE REACTS WITH THE COPPER I OXIDE TO MAKE COPPER AND SULFUR DIOXIDE. THIS MAKES IMPURE COPPER.
COPPER IS MADE PURE BY ELECTROLYZING IT. A THIN SHEET OF PURE COPPER IS PUT ON THE CATHODE AND A THICK SHEET OF IMPURE COPPER IS PUT ON THE ANODE. THE ELECTROLYTE IS COPPER SULFATE. THE IMPURE COPPER GETS DISSOLVED IN THE SOLUTION. IT THEN COATS THE THIN SHEET OF PURE COPPER. THIS MAKES THE COPPER PURE.
LARGE AMOUNTS OF COPPER ARE RECYCLED BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH VALUE AND THE INCREASING DEPLETION OF WORLDWIDE COPPER RESERVES.
CRYPTOGRAPHY
CRYPTOGRAPHY OR CRYPTOLOGY IS THE PRACTICE AND STUDY OF HIDING INFORMATION. IT IS SOMETIMES CALLED CODE BUT THIS IS NOT REALLY A CORRECT NAME. IT IS THE SCIENCE USED TO TRY TO KEEP INFORMATION SECRET AND SAFE. MODERN CRYPTOGRAPHY IS A MIX OF MATHEMATICS COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. CRYPTOGRAPHY IS USED IN ATM BANK CARDS COMPUTER PASSWORDS AND SHOPPING ON THE INTERNET.
WHEN A MESSAGE IS SENT USING CRYPTOGRAPHY IT IS CHANGED OR ENCRYPTED BEFORE IT IS SENT. THE METHOD OF CHANGING TEXT IS CALLED A CODE OR MORE PRECISELY A CIPHER. THE CHANGED TEXT IS CALLED CIPHERTEXT. THE CHANGE MAKES THE MESSAGE HARD TO READ. SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO READ IT MUST CHANGE IT BACK OR DECRYPT IT. HOW TO CHANGE IT BACK IS A SECRET. BOTH THE PERSON THAT SENDS THE MESSAGE AND THE ONE THAT GETS IT SHOULD KNOW THE SECRET WAY TO CHANGE IT BUT OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO. STUDYING THE CYPHERTEXT TO DISCOVER THE SECRET IS CALLED CRYPTANALYSIS OR CRACKING OR SOMETIMES CODE BREAKING.
DIFFERENT TYPES OF CRYPTOGRAPHY CAN BE EASIER OR HARDER TO USE AND CAN HIDE THE SECRET MESSAGE BETTER OR WORSE. CIPHERS USE A KEY WHICH IS A SECRET THAT HIDES THE SECRET MESSAGES. THE CRYPTOGRAPHIC METHOD NEEDN T BE SECRET. VARIOUS PEOPLE CAN USE THE SAME METHOD BUT DIFFERENT KEYS SO THEY CANNOT READ EACH OTHER S MESSAGES. SINCE THE CAESAR CIPHER HAS ONLY AS MANY KEYS AS THE NUMBER OF LETTERS IN THE ALPHABET IT IS EASILY CRACKED BY TRYING ALL THE KEYS. CIPHERS THAT ALLOW BILLIONS OF KEYS ARE CRACKED BY MORE COMPLEX METHODS.
SINCE THE TIME OF CAESAR MANY IMPROVED CYPHERS HAVE BEEN MADE. SOME INVOLVED CLEVER MATHEMATICS TO RESIST CLEVER CRYPTANALYSIS. DURING THE 20TH CENTURY COMPUTERS BECAME THE PRINCIPLE TOOL OF CRYPTOGRAPHY. 
IN A SYMMETRIC KEY ALGORITHM BOTH THE SENDER AND RECEIVER SHARE THE KEY. THE SENDER USES THE KEY TO HIDE THE MESSAGE. THEN THE RECEIVER WILL USE THE SAME KEY IN THE OPPOSITE WAY TO REVEAL THE MESSAGE. FOR CENTURIES MOST CRYPTOGRAPHY HAS BEEN SYMMETRIC. ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD IS A WIDELY USED ONE. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH SYMMETRY..
ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY IS HARDER TO USE. EACH PERSON WHO WANTS TO USE ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY USES A SECRET NUMBER A PRIVATE KEY THAT IS NOT SHARED AND A DIFFERENT NUMBER A PUBLIC KEY THAT THEY CAN TELL EVERYONE. IF SOMEONE ELSE WANTS TO SEND THIS PERSON A MESSAGE THEY LL USE THE NUMBER THEY VE BEEN TOLD TO HIDE THE MESSAGE. NOW THE MESSAGE CANNOT BE REVEALED EVEN BY THE SENDER BUT THE RECEIVER CAN EASILY REVEAL THE MESSAGE WITH HIS SECRET OR PRIVATE KEY. THIS WAY NOBODY ELSE NEEDS TO KNOW THE SECRET KEY.
THE DETAILS OF ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY MAKE IT LESS USEFUL THAN SYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY FOR ACTUALLY SENDING MESSAGES. INSTEAD IT IS OFTEN USED FOR COMPUTER SIGNATURES WHEN A COMPUTER MUST KNOW THAT A FILE WAS SENT FROM A CERTAIN SENDER. FOR EXAMPLE COMPUTER SOFTWARE COMPANIES THAT RELEASE UPDATES FOR THEIR SOFTWARE CAN SIGN THOSE UPDATES TO PROVE THAT THE UPDATE WAS MADE BY THEM SO THAT HACKERS CANNOT MAKE THEIR OWN UPDATES THAT WOULD CAUSE HARM. COMPUTERS CAN ALSO USE ASYMMETRIC CIPHERS TO GIVE EACH OTHER THE KEYS FOR SYMMETRIC CIPHERS.
COMPUTERS CAN CALCULATE QUICKLY. THEY CAN DO VERY STRONG ENCRYPTION AND MOST 21ST CENTURY CRYPTOGRAPHY USES THEM. EXAMPLES ARE COMPUTER ALGORITHMS LIKE RSA AES AND THERE ARE MANY OTHERS. USING GOOD ALGORITHMS LIKE THESE CAN MAKE IT VERY HARD TO READ THE INFORMATION THAT IS SENT.
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SLOWER THAN COMPUTERS ANY CRYPTOGRAPHY THEY USE CAN PROBABLY BE BROKEN IF ENOUGH OF THE SECRET WAY TO CHANGE IT IS KNOWN.
SIMPLE FORMS OF CRYPTOGRAPHY THAT PEOPLE CAN DO WITHOUT MACHINES ARE CAESAR CIPHERS AND TRANSPOSITION CIPHERS BUT MANY OTHER KINDS WERE USED BEFORE COMPUTERS WERE USED. 
DNA
DNA SHORT FOR DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID IS THE MOLECULE THAT CONTAINS THE GENETIC CODE OF ORGANISMS. THIS INCLUDES ANIMALS PLANTS PROTISTS ARCHAEA AND BACTERIA. 
DNA IS IN EACH CELL IN THE ORGANISM AND TELLS CELLS WHAT PROTEINS TO MAKE. MOSTLY THESE PROTEINS ARE ENZYMES. DNA IS INHERITED BY CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS. THIS IS WHY CHILDREN SHARE TRAITS WITH THEIR PARENTS SUCH AS SKIN HAIR AND EYE COLOR. THE DNA IN A PERSON IS A COMBINATION OF THE DNA FROM EACH OF THEIR PARENTS.
PART OF AN ORGANISM S DNA IS NON CODING DNA SEQUENCES. THEY DO NOT CODE FOR PROTEIN SEQUENCES. SOME NONCODING DNA IS TRANSCRIBED INTO NON CODING RNA MOLECULES SUCH AS TRANSFER RNA RIBOSOMAL RNA AND REGULATORY RNAS. OTHER SEQUENCES ARE NOT TRANSCRIBED AT ALL OR GIVE RISE TO RNA OF UNKNOWN FUNCTION. THE AMOUNT OF NON CODING DNA VARIES GREATLY AMONG SPECIES. FOR EXAMPLE OVER 98 OF THE HUMAN GENOME IS NON CODING DNA WHILE ONLY ABOUT 2 OF A TYPICAL BACTERIAL GENOME IS NON CODING DNA.
VIRUSES USE EITHER DNA OR RNA TO INFECT ORGANISMS. THE GENOME REPLICATION OF MOST DNA VIRUSES TAKES PLACE IN THE CELL S NUCLEUS WHEREAS RNA VIRUSES USUALLY REPLICATE IN THE CYTOPLASM.
DNA HAS A DOUBLE HELIX SHAPE WHICH IS LIKE A LADDER TWISTED INTO A SPIRAL. EACH STEP OF THE LADDER IS A PAIR OF NUCLEOTIDES.
A NUCLEOTIDE IS A MOLECULE MADE UP OF 
DNA IS MADE OF FOUR TYPES OF NUCLEOTIDE 
THE RUNGS OF THE DNA LADDER ARE EACH MADE OF TWO BASES ONE BASE COMING FROM EACH LEG. THE BASES CONNECT IN THE MIDDLE A ONLY PAIRS WITH T AND C ONLY PAIRS WITH G. THE BASES ARE HELD TOGETHER BY HYDROGEN BONDS. 
ADENINE A AND THYMINE T CAN PAIR UP BECAUSE THEY MAKE TWO HYDROGEN BONDS AND CYTOSINE C AND GUANINE G PAIR UP TO MAKE THREE HYDROGEN BONDS. ALTHOUGH THE BASES ARE ALWAYS IN FIXED PAIRS THE PAIRS CAN COME IN ANY ORDER A T OR T A SIMILARLY C G OR G C. THIS WAY DNA CAN WRITE CODES OUT OF THE LETTERS THAT ARE THE BASES. THESE CODES CONTAIN THE MESSAGE THAT TELLS THE CELL WHAT TO DO.
ON CHROMOSOMES THE DNA IS BOUND UP WITH PROTEINS CALLED HISTONES TO FORM CHROMATIN. THIS ASSOCIATION TAKES PART IN EPIGENETICS AND GENE REGULATION. GENES ARE SWITCHED ON AND OFF DURING DEVELOPMENT AND CELL ACTIVITY AND THIS REGULATION IS THE BASIS OF MOST OF THE ACTIVITY WHICH TAKES PLACE IN CELLS.
WHEN DNA IS COPIED THIS IS CALLED DNA REPLICATION. BRIEFLY THE HYDROGEN BONDS HOLDING TOGETHER PAIRED BASES ARE BROKEN AND THE MOLECULE IS SPLIT IN HALF THE LEGS OF THE LADDER ARE SEPARATED. THIS GIVES TWO SINGLE STRANDS. NEW STRANDS ARE FORMED BY MATCHING THE BASES A WITH T AND G WITH C TO MAKE THE MISSING STRANDS. 
FIRST AN ENZYME CALLED DNA HELICASE SPLITS THE DNA DOWN THE MIDDLE BY BREAKING THE HYDROGEN BONDS. THEN AFTER THE DNA MOLECULE IS IN TWO SEPARATE PIECES ANOTHER MOLECULE CALLED DNA POLYMERASE MAKES A NEW STRAND THAT MATCHES EACH OF THE STRANDS OF THE SPLIT DNA MOLECULE. EACH COPY OF A DNA MOLECULE IS MADE OF HALF OF THE ORIGINAL STARTING MOLECULE AND HALF OF NEW BASES.
WHEN DNA IS COPIED MISTAKES ARE SOMETIMES MADE THESE ARE CALLED MUTATIONS. THERE ARE THREE MAIN TYPES OF MUTATIONS 
MUTATIONS MAY ALSO BE CLASSIFIED BY THEIR EFFECT ON THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF PROTEINS OR THEIR EFFECT ON FITNESS. MUTATIONS MAY BE BAD FOR THE ORGANISM OR NEUTRAL OR OF BENEFIT. SOMETIMES MUTATIONS ARE FATAL FOR THE ORGANISM THE PROTEIN MADE BY THE NEW DNA DOES NOT WORK AT ALL AND THIS CAUSES THE EMBRYO TO DIE. ON THE OTHER HAND EVOLUTION IS MOVED FORWARD BY MUTATIONS WHEN THE NEW VERSION OF THE PROTEIN WORKS BETTER FOR THE ORGANISM.
A SECTION OF DNA THAT CONTAINS INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE A PROTEIN IS CALLED A GENE. EACH GENE HAS THE SEQUENCE FOR AT LEAST ONE POLYPEPTIDE. PROTEINS FORM STRUCTURES AND ALSO FORM ENZYMES. THE ENZYMES DO MOST OF THE WORK IN CELLS. PROTEINS ARE MADE OUT OF SMALLER POLYPEPTIDES WHICH ARE FORMED OF AMINO ACIDS. TO MAKE A PROTEIN TO DO A PARTICULAR JOB THE CORRECT AMINO ACIDS HAVE TO BE JOINED UP IN THE CORRECT ORDER. 
PROTEINS ARE MADE BY TINY MACHINES IN THE CELL CALLED RIBOSOMES. RIBOSOMES ARE IN THE MAIN BODY OF THE CELL BUT DNA IS ONLY IN THE NUCLEUS OF THE CELL. THE CODON IS PART OF THE DNA BUT DNA NEVER LEAVES THE NUCLEUS. BECAUSE DNA CANNOT LEAVE THE NUCLEUS THE CELL MAKES A COPY OF THE DNA SEQUENCE IN RNA. THIS IS SMALLER AND CAN GET THROUGH THE HOLES PORES IN THE MEMBRANE OF THE NUCLEUS AND OUT INTO THE CELL. 
GENES ENCODED IN DNA ARE TRANSCRIBED INTO MESSENGER RNA MRNA BY PROTEINS SUCH AS RNA POLYMERASE. MATURE MRNA IS THEN USED AS A TEMPLATE FOR PROTEIN SYNTHESIS BY THE RIBOSOME. RIBOSOMES READ CODONS WORDS MADE OF THREE BASE PAIRS THAT TELL THE RIBOSOME WHICH AMINO ACID TO ADD. THE RIBOSOME SCANS ALONG AN MRNA READING THE CODE WHILE IT MAKES PROTEIN. ANOTHER RNA CALLED TRNA HELPS MATCH THE RIGHT AMINO ACID TO EACH CODON.
DNA WAS FIRST ISOLATED EXTRACTED FROM CELLS BY SWISS PHYSICIAN FRIEDRICH MIESCHER IN 1869 WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON BACTERIA FROM THE PUS IN SURGICAL BANDAGES. THE MOLECULE WAS FOUND IN THE NUCLEUS OF THE CELLS AND SO HE CALLED IT NUCLEIN. 
IN 1928 FREDERICK GRIFFITH DISCOVERED THAT TRAITS OF THE SMOOTH FORM OF PNEUMOCOCCUS COULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE ROUGH FORM OF THE SAME BACTERIA BY MIXING KILLED SMOOTH BACTERIA WITH THE LIVE ROUGH FORM. THIS SYSTEM PROVIDED THE FIRST CLEAR SUGGESTION THAT DNA CARRIES GENETIC INFORMATION.
THE AVERY MACLEOD MCCARTY EXPERIMENT IDENTIFIED DNA AS THE TRANSFORMING PRINCIPLE IN 1943.
DNA S ROLE IN HEREDITY WAS CONFIRMED IN 1952 WHEN ALFRED HERSHEY AND MARTHA CHASE IN THE HERSHEY CHASE EXPERIMENT SHOWED THAT DNA IS THE GENETIC MATERIAL OF THE T2 BACTERIOPHAGE.
IN THE 1950S ERWIN CHARGAFF FOUND THAT THE AMOUNT OF THYMINE T PRESENT IN A MOLECULE OF DNA WAS ABOUT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF ADENINE A PRESENT. HE FOUND THAT THE SAME APPLIES TO GUANINE G AND CYTOSINE C. CHARGAFF S RULES SUMMARISES THIS FINDING.
IN 1953 JAMES D. WATSON AND FRANCIS CRICK SUGGESTED WHAT IS NOW ACCEPTED AS THE FIRST CORRECT DOUBLE HELIX MODEL OF DNA STRUCTURE IN THE JOURNAL NATURE. THEIR DOUBLE HELIX MOLECULAR MODEL OF DNA WAS THEN BASED ON A SINGLE X RAY DIFFRACTION IMAGE PHOTO 51 TAKEN BY ROSALIND FRANKLIN AND RAYMOND GOSLING IN MAY 1952. 
EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE WATSON AND CRICK MODEL WAS PUBLISHED IN A SERIES OF FIVE ARTICLES IN THE SAME ISSUE OF NATURE. OF THESE FRANKLIN AND GOSLING S PAPER WAS THE FIRST PUBLICATION OF THEIR OWN X RAY DIFFRACTION DATA AND ORIGINAL ANALYSIS METHOD THAT PARTLY SUPPORTED THE WATSON AND CRICK MODEL THIS ISSUE ALSO CONTAINED AN ARTICLE ON DNA STRUCTURE BY MAURICE WILKINS AND TWO OF HIS COLLEAGUES WHOSE ANALYSIS AND IN VIVO B DNA X RAY PATTERNS ALSO SUPPORTED THE PRESENCE IN VIVO OF THE DOUBLE HELICAL DNA CONFIGURATIONS AS PROPOSED BY CRICK AND WATSON FOR THEIR DOUBLE HELIX MOLECULAR MODEL OF DNA IN THE PREVIOUS TWO PAGES OF NATURE. IN 1962 AFTER FRANKLIN S DEATH WATSON CRICK AND WILKINS JOINTLY RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSIOLOGY OR MEDICINE. NOBEL PRIZES WERE AWARDED ONLY TO LIVING RECIPIENTS AT THE TIME. A DEBATE CONTINUES ABOUT WHO SHOULD RECEIVE CREDIT FOR THE DISCOVERY.
IN 1957 CRICK EXPLAINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DNA RNA AND PROTEINS IN THE CENTRAL DOGMA OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY. 
HOW DNA WAS COPIED THE REPLICATION MECHANISM CAME IN 1958 THROUGH THE MESELSON STAHL EXPERIMENT. MORE WORK BY CRICK AND COWORKERS SHOWED THAT THE GENETIC CODE WAS BASED ON NON OVERLAPPING TRIPLETS OF BASES CALLED CODONS. THESE FINDINGS REPRESENT THE BIRTH OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY.
HOW WATSON AND CRICK GOT FRANKLIN S RESULTS HAS BEEN MUCH DEBATED. CRICK WATSON AND MAURICE WILKINS WERE AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN 1962 FOR THEIR WORK ON DNA ROSALIND FRANKLIN HAD DIED IN 1958.
DATABASE
A DATABASE IS A SYSTEM FOR STORING AND TAKING CARE OF DATA ANY KIND OF INFORMATION.
A DATABASE ENGINE CAN SORT CHANGE OR SERVE THE INFORMATION ON THE DATABASE. THE INFORMATION ITSELF CAN BE STORED IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS BEFORE DIGITAL COMPUTERS CARD FILES PRINTED BOOKS AND OTHER METHODS WERE USED. NOW MOST DATA IS KEPT ON COMPUTER FILES.
A DATABASE SYSTEM IS A COMPUTER PROGRAM FOR MANAGING ELECTRONIC DATABASES. A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF A DATABASE SYSTEM WOULD BE AN ELECTRONIC STUPID IDOTIN FILE CABINETS. THERE WAS USUALLY ONE CARD FOR EACH EMPLOYEE. ON THE CARD INFORMATION SUCH AS THE DATE OF BIRTH OR THE NAME OF THE EMPLOYEE COULD BE FOUND. A DATABASE ALSO HAS SUCH CARDS. TO THE USER THE CARD WILL LOOK THE SAME AS IT DID IN OLD TIMES ONLY THIS TIME IT WILL BE ON THE SCREEN. TO THE COMPUTER THE INFORMATION ON THE CARD CAN BE STORED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. EACH OF THESE WAYS IS KNOWN AS A DATABASE MODEL. THE MOST COMMONLY USED DATABASE MODEL IS CALLED RELATIONAL DATABASE MODEL IT USES RELATIONS AND SETS TO STORE THE SXVGV
A. NORMAL USERS TALKING ABOUT THE DATABASE MODEL WILL NOT TALK ABOUT RELATIONS THEY WILL TALK ABOUT DATABASE TABLES.
USES FOR DATABASE SYSTEMS INCLUDE 
IN DATABASES SOME DATA CHANGES OCCASIONALLY. THERE MAY BE PROBLEMS WHEN DATA IS CHANGED AN ERROR MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED. THE ERROR MIGHT MAKE THE DATA USELESS. THE DATABASE SYSTEM LOOKS AT THE DATA IT MUST FULFILL CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. IT DOES THIS BY USING A TRANSACTION. THERE ARE TWO POINTS IN TIME IN THE DATABASE THE TIME BEFORE THE DATA WAS CHANGED AND THE TIME AFTER THE DATA WAS CHANGED. IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG WHEN CHANGING THE DATA THE DATABASE SYSTEM SIMPLY PUTS THE DATABASE BACK INTO THE STATE BEFORE THE CHANGE HAPPENED. THIS IS CALLED ROLLBACK. AFTER ALL THE CHANGES ARE DONE SUCCESSFULLY THEY ARE COMMITTED. THIS MEANS THAT THE DATA MAKES SENSE AGAIN COMMITTED CHANGES CAN NO LONGER BE UNDONE.
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS DATABASES FOLLOW THE ACID PRINCIPLE 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS HOW TO REPRESENT THE DATA.
LIKE IN REAL LIFE THE SAME DATA CAN BE LOOKED AT FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND IT CAN BE ORGANIZED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. THERE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN ORGANIZING THE DATA 
DEATH
DEATH IS THE END OF LIFE IN AN ORGANISM. ALL BIOLOGICAL AND LIVING ACTIVITY OF THE LIVING THING STOP INCLUDING THE MIND AND THE SENSES. THE USUAL SIGNAL FOR DEATH IS THAT THE HEART STOPS BEATING AND CANNOT BE RESTARTED. THIS CAN BE CAUSED BY MANY THINGS. ALL LIVING THINGS HAVE A LIMITED LIFESPAN AND ALL LIVING THINGS EVENTUALLY DIE. 
LIVING THINGS WHICH HAVE DIED ARE NORMALLY DESCRIBED AS BEING DEAD. DEATH OF HUMANS IS OFTEN INVESTIGATED FOR THE CAUSE IN CASE OF CRIME SUCH AS MURDER OR DISEASE THAT MAY CONTINUE TO KILL OTHER HUMANS. ABOUT 150 000 PEOPLE DIE EVERY DAY AROUND THE WORLD. ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THESE PEOPLE DIE BECAUSE OF AGE. IN ADDITION TO THE PHYSICAL BODY SOME BELIEVE HUMANS ALSO HAVE A SOUL AND BELIEVE THAT THE SOUL CAN CONTINUE WITHOUT A BODY AFTERLIFE MOVE INTO ANOTHER BODY REINCARNATION OR CEASE TO EXIST ANNIHILATIONISM. RELIGIONS HAVE DIFFERENT BELIEFS ABOUT THIS ISSUE. MANY CULTURES HAVE THEIR OWN CUSTOMS AND RITUALS TO RESPECT THE DEAD.
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THINGS OR EVENTS THAT LEAD TO THE DEATH OF A PLANT OR ANIMAL THOSE THINGS OR EVENTS ARE USUALLY DESCRIBED AS BEING DEADLY OR FATAL. IN THE CASE OF DISEASES THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS TERMINAL. HUMANS ARE NO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER LIFEFORM. OUR BODIES HAVE AN ABILITY FOR SELF REPAIR BUT THAT ABILITY IS LIMITED. FINDING THE CAUSE OF DEATH IS A MEDICAL SPECIALITY CALLED PATHOLOGY. IN MEDICINE DEATH IS WHEN THE HEART STOPS BEATING FOR MORE THAN SEVERAL MINUTES. THERE ARE SPECIAL TIMES IN WHICH PEOPLE RECOVER EVEN THOUGH THE HEART HAS STOPPED FOR 30 MINUTES SUCH AS NEAR DROWNING IN VERY COLD WATER. IF MACHINES ARE USED TO HELP THE HEART AND LUNGS WORK THEN THE MOMENT OF DEATH IS MORE DIFFICULT TO KNOW.
DEATH IS COMMONLY A SAD OR UNPLEASANT THING TO PEOPLE. IT CAN MAKE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEIR OWN DEATH. PEOPLE MIGHT MISS OR BE SAD FOR THE PERSON WHO HAS DIED. THEY MIGHT ALSO BE SAD FOR THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF THE PERSON WHO HAS DIED.
IN ANY SOCIETY HUMAN DEATH IS SURROUNDED BY RITUAL A WAKE OR FUNERAL IS NORMAL. IN SOME PLACES IT WAS COMMON TO EAT THE DEAD IN A FORM OF RITUAL CANNIBALISM. BUT THIS IS NO LONGER COMMON IN PART BECAUSE DISEASE LIKE KURU CAN BE PASSED THIS WAY. HUMAN DEAD BODIES ARE TABOO IN MOST SOCIETIES AND MUST BE HANDLED IN SPECIAL WAYS FOR A COMBINATION OF RELIGIOUS AND HYGIENE REASONS. A HUMAN DEAD BODY MUST ALWAYS BE REPORTED IN LAW TO BE SURE IT IS DISPOSED OF PROPERLY.
FINDING THE CAUSE OF ANY HUMAN DEATH AND STOPPING A SIMILAR DEATH FROM HAPPENING TO SOMEONE ELSE ARE THE MAIN REASONS PEOPLE LOOK INTO HUMAN MORBIDITY OR LET DEAD BODIES BE CUT OPEN AND LOOKED AT IN AN AUTOPSY. SOME RELIGIONS DO NOT ALLOW AUTOPSIES BECAUSE THEY FEEL THE BODY IS HOLY. AUTOPSIES ARE USUALLY REQUIRED BY THE STATE IF SOMEONE DIES AND PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW WHY. THE AUTOPSY HELPS FIND OUT IF SOMEONE KILLED THE PERSON ON PURPOSE TRIED TO HURT THEM OR IF THEY DIED FROM A SICKNESS.
TO PREPARE FOR THEIR OWN DEATH HUMANS CAN WRITE A LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHO GETS THEIR PROPERTY AND POSSESSIONS. A PERSON WILL SOMETIMES ALSO VOLUNTEER TO BE AN ORGAN DONOR. THIS MIGHT MEAN GIVING THE WHOLE BODY TO MEDICAL RESEARCH. IT CAN ALSO SAVE THE LIVES OF OTHERS BY MAKING ORGAN TRANSPLANTS POSSIBLE.
FOR A LONG TIME MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AFRAID OF DEATH AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WONDERED ABOUT WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO PEOPLE AFTER THEY DIE. THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST QUESTIONS OF PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION. MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THERE IS SOME FORM OF AFTERLIFE.
ANCIENT RULERS SOMETIMES DID INSIST NOT ONLY THAT THEIR OWN BODIES AND MUCH PROPERTY BUT EVEN THEIR SERVANTS AND RELATIVES BE DESTROYED AT THEIR FUNERAL. IN INDIA THIS RITUAL STILL DOES SOMETIMES OCCUR. OLD WOMEN SOMETIMES CARRY GUNS IN CASE THEIR HUSBAND S RELATIVES COME TO THROW THEM ON THE FUNERAL FIRE.
CHRISTIANITY HAS A SPECIAL FOCUS ON DEATH BECAUSE OF THE STATE KILLING OF JESUS CHRIST BY THE ROMANS. IN ISLAM THIS IS THOUGHT TO DEMONSTRATE THE INJUSTICE OF HUMAN SYSTEMS OF DEALING OUT DEATH AND THE ABILITY OF THE BEST PEOPLE TO OVERCOME IT AND EVEN FORGIVE IT. IN CHRISTIANITY ITSELF IT IS THOUGHT TO PROVE THAT JESUS HIMSELF WAS REALLY GOD AND SO COULD LOSE HIS BODY AND STILL HAVE THE POWER OF RESURRECTION. IN BUDDHISM REINCARNATION IS BELIEVED TO OCCUR. REINCARNATION IS AN IDEA TAKEN FROM HINDUISM.
CONFUCIANISM ADVISES RESPECT FOR PARENTS AND FORMS OF ANCESTOR WORSHIP TO RESPECT BOTH DEAD AND LIVING ANCESTORS.
EVERY ETHICAL TRADITION INCLUDING THE MEDICAL VIEW OF THE BODY HAS SOME RITUAL SURROUNDING DEATH. OFTEN THESE EXCUSE BEHAVIOURS THAT MIGHT BE HATED IF THEY DID NOT HAVE THE RITUAL. FOR INSTANCE ONE MAY SAY THAT ORGAN TRANSPLANT IS LIKE CANNIBALISM.
VERY MUCH OF WHAT HAPPENS AT A HUMAN DEATH IS RITUAL. PEOPLE WHO WISH THEIRS TO BE DEALT WITH A CERTAIN WAY AND WHO WISH A PARTICULAR TREATMENT LIKE CREMATION OF THEIR BODY SHOULD DECIDE IN ADVANCE AND SET UP THE NECESSARY PAYMENTS AND AGREEMENTS. THIS MAKES IT MUCH EASIER FOR THEIR FAMILY AFTER THEY DIE SINCE THERE IS NO LONGER THE ABILITY TO CLEARLY COMMUNICATE THE WISH.
FOR THE SAME REASON SAYING GOODBYE IS IMPORTANT. MOST OF THE STRESS OF DEATH SEEMS TO COME FOR LOVED ONES WHO DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE.
MAYBE IT IS TO RELIEVE THIS STRESS THAT RITUALS ARE CREATED AND TO BRING TOGETHER THOSE THAT KNEW SOMEONE SO THAT THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE A PERSON CAN NO LONGER COMMUNICATE FOR THEMSELVES CAN BE EXCHANGED BY OTHERS.
SOME RITUAL SUCH AS SEANCES CLAIM TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO SPEAK TO THE DEAD. THIS IS NOT CLAIMED TO BE VERY RELIABLE BOTH BY SCIENTISTS AND EVEN BY THOSE WHO DO THEM VERY OFTEN.
ASIDE FROM WILLS GOODBYES ORGAN DONATIONS AND FUNERALS THERE IS IMPORTANT PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO DECIDE TO PASS ON OR NOT WHEN SOMEONE KNOWS THEY MAY SOON DIE. PALLIATIVE CARE FOCUSES ON BASIC DECISIONS PEOPLE MAKE WHEN THEY ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE END OF THEIR LIVES AND IT ENSURES SOMEONE IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO TALK TO THEM. IT IS A REPLACEMENT FOR HEROIC MEDICAL INTERVENTION THAT MAY KEEP THEM PHYSICALLY ALIVE BUT WITH NO QUALITY OF LIFE. HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY MUST PREPARE FOR DEATH IF IT IS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A QUICK SURPRISE 
ELIZABETH KUBLER ROSS WROTE THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL STAGES IN DYING OF WHICH DENIAL WAS THE FIRST AND ACCEPTANCE WAS THE LAST. RECORDING ONE S LIFE IS OFTEN SOMETHING PEOPLE WITH ACCEPTANCE WILL DO TO LEAVE A MEMOIR OR A FULL AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
BECAUSE EVENTS LEAVE LIVING MEMORY AND MAY ONLY BE PART OF ORAL TRADITION THERE ARE PROJECTS TO RECORD EVERYTHING THAT PEOPLE REMEMBER ABOUT WORLD WAR I AND THE SHOAH. THE FIRST OF THESE WAS TO RECORD EVERYTHING REMEMBERED ABOUT THE U.S. CIVIL WAR. THIS DISCIPLINE HAS CHANGED HISTORY SINCE WE HAVE SO MANY MORE FIRST PERSON ACCOUNTS OF THE TIMES AND MADE SOCIAL HISTORY MUCH MORE STANDARD.
THERE ARE OTHER TERMS FOR DEATH. EXAMPLES ARE TO PASS AWAY TO GO TO A BETTER PLACE TO BUY THE FARM GENERALLY USED IN THE MILITARY TO LEAVE THE EARTH AND TO KICK THE BUCKET. THE TERM GONE MAY ALSO BE A TERM FOR DESCRIBING DEATH. FOR EXAMPLE IF A PERSON HAS DIED THEY ARE ALSO SAID TO BE GONE AS IN GONE TO A BETTER PLACE OR NO LONGER HERE.
OLD AGE IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT GETS RID OF YOUR LIFE. PEOPLE MAKE PEOPLE DIE. THIS IS CALLED KILLING. SOME POPULAR ONES LIKE JOHN WILKS BOOTH KILLING ABRHAM LINCOLN AND JAMES EARL RAY KILLING MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. APRIL 4 1968 EVEN DIE FROM THE HATERS. 
1. OLD AGE NATURAL CAUSES 2. SEVERE HAEMORRHAGE 3. CANCER4. TRAUMA5. STARVATION OR DEHYDRATION 6. DIESEASE 
DEMOCRACY
A DEMOCRACY MEANS RULE BY THE PEOPLE. THE NAME IS USED FOR DIFFERENT FORMS OF GOVERNMENT WHERE THE PEOPLE CAN TAKE PART IN THE DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THE WAY THEIR COMMUNITY IS RUN. IN MODERN TIMES THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS THIS CAN BE DONE 
TO BECOME A STABLE DEMOCRACY A STATE USUALLY UNDERGOES A PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION.
AFTER PEOPLE HOLD AN ELECTION THE CANDIDATES THAT WON ARE DETERMINED. THE WAY THIS IS DONE CAN BE SIMPLE THE CANDIDATE WITH THE MOST VOTES GETS ELECTED. VERY OFTEN THE POLITICIANS BEING ELECTED BELONG TO A POLITICAL PARTY. INSTEAD OF CHOOSING A PERSON PEOPLE VOTE FOR A PARTY. THE PARTY WITH THE MOST VOTES THEN PICKS THE CANDIDATES. 
USUALLY THE PEOPLE BEING ELECTED NEED TO MEET CERTAIN CONDITIONS THEY NEED TO HAVE A CERTAIN AGE OR A GOVERNMENT BODY NEEDS TO DETERMINE THAT THEY ARE SUITABLY QUALIFIED TO PERFORM THE JOB. 
NOT EVERYONE CAN VOTE IN AN ELECTION. SUFFRAGE IS ONLY GIVEN TO PEOPLE WHO ARE CITIZENS. SOME GROUPS MAY BE EXCLUDED FOR EXAMPLE PRISONERS. 
FOR SOME ELECTIONS A COUNTRY MAY MAKE VOTING COMPULSORY. SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT VOTE AND WHO DOES NOT GIVE A GOOD REASON USUALLY HAS TO PAY A FINE.
DEMOCRACY MAY BE DIRECT OR INDIRECT.
IN A DIRECT DEMOCRACY EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE LAWS TOGETHER. ONE MODERN EXAMPLE OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY IS A REFERENDUM WHICH IS THE NAME FOR THE KIND OF WAY TO PASS A LAW WHERE EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY VOTES ON IT. DIRECT DEMOCRACIES ARE NOT USUALLY USED TO RUN COUNTRIES BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO GET MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO GET TOGETHER ALL THE TIME TO MAKE LAWS AND OTHER DECISIONS. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TIME.
IN AN INDIRECT OR REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY PEOPLE CHOOSE REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE LAWS FOR THEM. THESE PEOPLE CAN BE MAYORS COUNCILMEN MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT OR OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. THIS IS A MUCH MORE COMMON KIND OF DEMOCRACY. LARGE COMMUNITIES LIKE CITIES AND COUNTRIES USE THIS METHOD BUT IT MAY NOT BE NEEDED FOR A SMALL GROUP.
THIS KIND OF GOVERNMENT WAS DEVELOPED LONG AGO BY THE ANCIENT GREEKS IN CLASSICAL ATHENS. THEY HAD EVERYONE WHO WAS A CITIZEN NOT SLAVES WOMEN FOREIGNERS AND CHILDREN GET TOGETHER IN ONE AREA. THE ASSEMBLY WOULD TALK ABOUT WHAT KINDS OF LAWS THEY WANTED AND VOTED ON THEM. THE COUNCIL WOULD SUGGEST THE LAWS. ALL CITIZENS WERE ALLOWED IN THE ASSEMBLY. 
THE COUNCIL WERE PICKED BY DRAWS LOTTERY. THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE COUNCIL WOULD CHANGE EVERY YEAR AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNCIL WAS AT THE MOST 500. FOR SOME OFFICES THE ATHENIAN CITIZENS WOULD PICK A LEADER BY WRITING THE NAME OF THEIR FAVORITE CANDIDATE ON A PIECE OF STONE OR WOOD. THE PERSON WITH THE MOST VOTES BECAME THE LEADER.
IN THE MIDDLE AGES THERE WERE MANY SYSTEMS IN WHICH THERE WERE ELECTIONS ALTHOUGH ONLY A FEW PEOPLE COULD JOIN IN AT THIS TIME. THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND BEGAN FROM THE MAGNA CARTA A DOCUMENT WHICH SAID THAT THE KING S POWER WAS LIMITED AND PROTECTED CERTAIN RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE. THE FIRST ELECTED PARLIAMENT WAS DE MONTFORT S PARLIAMENT IN ENGLAND IN 1265.
HOWEVER ONLY A FEW PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY JOIN IN. PARLIAMENT WAS CHOSEN BY ONLY A FEW PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE IN 1780 FEWER THAN 3 OF PEOPLE JOINED IN. THE RULER ALSO HAD THE POWER TO CALL PARLIAMENTS. AFTER A LONG TIME THE POWER OF PARLIAMENT BEGAN TO GROW. AFTER THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION IN 1688 THE ENGLISH BILL OF RIGHTS 1689 MADE PARLIAMENT MORE POWERFUL. LATER THE RULER BECAME A SYMBOL INSTEAD OF HAVING REAL POWER.
DICTIONARY
A DICTIONARY IS A BOOK WHICH EXPLAINS THE MEANINGS OF WORDS OR MORE PRECISELY LEXEMES. THE WORDS ARE ARRANGED IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER SO THAT THEY CAN BE FOUND QUICKLY. THE WORD DICTIONARY COMES FROM THE LATIN DICTIO SAYING.
THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES OF DICTIONARIES DICTIONARIES WHICH EXPLAIN WORDS AND HOW THEY ARE USED DICTIONARIES WHICH TRANSLATE WORDS FROM ONE LANGUAGE TO ANOTHER DICTIONARIES OF BIOGRAPHY WHICH TELL ABOUT FAMOUS PEOPLE TECHNICAL DICTIONARIES WHICH EXPLAIN THE MEANINGS OF TECHNICAL WORDS OR WORDS CONNECTED TO A PARTICULAR SUBJECT SOMETIMES CALLED A THESAURUS. SOME OF THESE COME CLOSE TO BEING AN ENCYCLOPEDIA BUT AN ENCYCLOPEDIA GIVES A LOT OF EXTRA INFORMATION ABOUT THINGS KNOWLEDGE AND DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE USE OF THE LANGUAGE. AN ENCYCLOPEDIC DICTIONARY GIVES LESS INFORMATION ABOUT THE TOPIC THAN A REAL ENCYCLOPEDIA DOES BUT MORE THAN A SIMPLE DICTIONARY.
DICTIONARIES WHICH EXPLAIN WHAT WORDS MEAN WILL GIVE A CLEAR DEFINITION OF THE WORD E.G. HIPPOPOTAMUS A HOOFED MAMMAL WITH THICK SKIN LARGE MOUTH AND SHORT LEGS THAT LIVES IN RIVERS AND LAKES OF AFRICA. 
A BIG DICTIONARY WILL ALSO GIVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORD. IT WILL EXPLAIN HOW IT IS PRONOUNCED. USUALLY THE INTERNATIONAL PHONETIC ALPHABET IS USED FOR THIS. IT WILL EXPLAIN HOW THE WORD IS USED. THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR A WORD LIKE HIPPOPOTAMUS BUT A WORD LIKE PUT HAS SO MANY DIFFERENT MEANINGS THAT A LARGE DICTIONARY MAY HAVE A WHOLE PAGE OR MORE TO EXPLAIN HOW IT CAN BE USED. IT WILL ALSO EXPLAIN THE ORIGIN OF THE WORD E.G. GREEK HIPPOS HORSE AND POTAMUS RIVER.
A DICTIONARY MAY ALSO GIVE THE FORM OF THE WORD IN DIFFERENT TENSES PLURAL FORM ETC.
THERE ARE ALSO DICTIONARIES WHICH TRANSLATE WORDS INTO FOREIGN LANGUAGES. VERY OFTEN ONE VOLUME ONE BOOK WILL TRANSLATE BOTH WAYS FOR EXAMPLE HALF THE BOOK MIGHT BE TRANSLATING FROM ENGLISH TO DUTCH AND THE OTHER HALF FROM DUTCH TO ENGLISH.
WHEN USING A DICTIONARY TO FIND OUT HOW TO SAY SOMETHING IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORD. A WORD LIKE RIGHT HAS TWO BASIC MEANINGS IN ENGLISH 1 CORRECT AND 2 THE OPPOSITE OF LEFT. OTHER LANGUAGES ARE NOT LIKE ENGLISH THEY WILL HAVE DIFFERENT WORDS FOR THESE DIFFERENT MEANINGS. A WORD LIKE PUT HAS MANY MEANINGS. A GOOD DICTIONARY WILL HAVE A LARGE LIST OF THESE MEANINGS TO HELP PEOPLE FIND THE WORD THEY WANT. IN MANY LANGUAGES FOR EXAMPLE THE WORD PUT WILL BE DIFFERENT ACCORDING TO WHETHER SOMETHING IS BEING PUT ONTO SOMETHING E.G. A TABLE OR INTO SOMETHING E.G. A CUPBOARD.
DICTIONARIES NEED TO BE UPDATED FREQUENTLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY LANGUAGE CHANGES. NEW WORDS ARE OFTEN BROUGHT INTO A LANGUAGE E.G. LOTS OF COMPUTER TERMS OR WORDS CHANGE THEIR MEANINGS E.G.

DINOSAUR
DINOSAURS MEANING TERRIBLE LIZARDS ARE A VARIED GROUP OF ARCHOSAUR REPTILES. THEY WERE THE DOMINANT LAND ANIMALS OF THE MESOZOIC ERA. OVER 500 DIFFERENT GENERA OF DINOSAURS ARE KNOWN. FOSSILS OF DINOSAURS HAVE BEEN FOUND ON EVERY CONTINENT AND THERE ARE STILL FREQUENT NEW DISCOVERIES. BIRDS EVOLVED FROM A TYPE OF DINOSAUR IN THE JURASSIC PERIOD.
DINOSAURS APPEARED IN THE UPPER TRIASSIC ABOUT 230 MILLION YEARS AGO. THE EARLIEST DATE OF A DINOSAUR FOSSIL IS THAT OF EORAPTOR 231.4 TO 228 MYA. BY THE EARLY JURASSIC THEY WERE THE TOP LAND VERTEBRATES AND DOMINATED MOST ENVIRONMENTS ON LAND. THEY CONTINUED UNTIL THE SUDDEN K T EXTINCTION EVENT 66 MILLION YEARS AGO.
FROM THE FOSSIL RECORD WE KNOW THAT BIRDS ARE LIVING FEATHERED DINOSAURS ALSO CALLED AVIAN DINOSAURS. THEY EVOLVED FROM THE EARLIEST THEROPODS DURING THE LATE JURASSIC. AND SO THEY WERE THE ONLY LINE OF DINOSAURS TO SURVIVE TO THE PRESENT DAY.
DINOSAURS HAD ADAPTATIONS WHICH HELPED MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL. THE FIRST KNOWN DINOSAURS WERE SMALL PREDATORS THAT WALKED ON TWO LEGS. ALL THEIR DESCENDANTS HAD AN UPRIGHT POSTURE WITH THE LEGS UNDERNEATH THE BODY. THIS TRANSFORMED THEIR WHOLE LIFE STYLE. THERE WERE OTHER FEATURES. MOST OF THE SMALLER DINOSAURS HAD FEATHERS AND WERE PROBABLY WARM BLOODED. THIS WOULD MAKE THEM ACTIVE WITH A HIGHER METABOLISM THAN MODERN REPTILES. SOCIAL INTERACTION WITH LIVING IN HERDS AND CO OPERATION SEEMS VERY LIKELY FOR SOME TYPES.
THE FIRST FOSSILS WERE RECOGNISED AS DINOSAURS IN THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY. SOME OF THEIR BONES WERE FOUND MUCH EARLIER BUT WERE NOT UNDERSTOOD. WILLIAM BUCKLAND GIDEON MANTELL AND RICHARD OWEN WERE SCIENTISTS WHO SAW THESE BONES WERE A SPECIAL GROUP OF ANIMALS. DINOSAURS ARE NOW MAJOR ATTRACTIONS AT MUSEUMS AROUND THE WORLD. THEY HAVE BECOME PART OF POPULAR CULTURE. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY BEST SELLING BOOKS AND MOVIES. NEW DISCOVERIES ARE REPORTED IN THE MEDIA.
DINOSAURS ARE UNITED BY AT LEAST 21 TRAITS IN THEIR SKULLS AND SKELETONS. THESE COMMON CHARACTERS CALLED SYNAPOMORPHIES ARE THE REASON PALAEONTOLOGISTS ARE SURE DINOSAURS HAD A COMMON ORIGIN.
HOWEVER WHEN DEFINITE DINOSAUR FOSSILS APPEAR EARLY IN THE UPPER TRIASSIC THE GROUP HAD ALREADY SPLIT INTO TWO GREAT ORDERS THE SAURISCHIA AND THE ORNITHISCHIA. THE SAURISCHIA KEEP THE ANCESTRAL HIP ARRANGEMENT INHERITED FROM THEIR ARCHOSAUR ANCESTORS AND THE ORNITHISCHIA HAVE A MODIFIED HIP STRUCTURE.
A. EORAPTOR AN EARLY SAURISCHIAN B LESOTHOSAURUS A PRIMITIVE ORNITHISCHIAN C A SAURISCHIAN PELVIS STAURIKOSAURUS D LESOTHOSAURUS PELVIS
THE FOLLOWING IS A SIMPLIFIED LIST OF DINOSAUR GROUPS BASED ON THEIR EVOLUTION IT IS ORGANIZED BASED A THE LIST OF MESOZOIC DINOSAUR SPECIES GIVEN BY HOLTZ 2007. GROUPS WITH A DAGGER NEXT TO THEM DON T HAVE ANY LIVING MEMBERS.
THE ARCHOSAURS EVOLVED INTO TWO MAIN CLADES THOSE RELATED TO CROCODILES AND THOSE RELATED TO DINOSAURS.
THE FIRST KNOWN DINOSAURS WERE BIPEDAL PREDATORS THAT WERE ONE TO TWO METRES LONG.
THE EARLIEST CONFIRMED DINOSAUR FOSSILS INCLUDE SAURISCHIAN LIZARD HIPPED DINOSAURS SATURNALIA 232 225 MYA HERRERASAURUS 230 220 MYA STAURIKOSAURUS POSSIBLY 230 225 MYA EORAPTOR 231.4 MYA AND ALWALKERIA 230 220 MYA. SATURNALIA MAY BE A BASAL SAURISCHIAN OR A PROSAUROPOD. THE OTHERS ARE BASAL SAURISCHIANS.
AMONG THE EARLIEST ORNITHISCHIAN BIRD HIPPED DINOSAURS IS PISANOSAURUS 230 220 MYA. ALTHOUGH LESOTHOSAURUS COMES FROM 199 189 MYA SKELETAL FEATURES SUGGEST THAT IT BRANCHED FROM THE MAIN ORNITHISCHIA LINE AT LEAST AS EARLY AS PISANOSAURUS.
EARLY SAURISCHIANS WERE SIMILAR TO EARLY ORNITHISCHIANS BUT DIFFERENT FROM MODERN CROCODILES. SAURISCHIANS DIFFER FROM ORNITHISCHIANS BY KEEPING THE ANCESTRAL CONFIGURATION OF BONES IN THE PELVIS SHOWN IN A DIAGRAM ABOVE. ANOTHER DIFFERENCE IS IN THE SKULL THE UPPER SKULL OF THE ORNITHISCHIA IS MORE SOLID AND THE JOINT CONNECTING THE LOWER JAW IS MORE FLEXIBLE. THESE FEATURES ARE ADAPTATIONS TO HERBIVORY IN OTHER WORDS IT HELPED THEM GRIND VEGETABLE FOOD.
DINOSAURS WERE A VARIED GROUP OF ANIMALS. ADAPTIVE RADIATION LET THEM LIVE IN MANY ECOLOGICAL NICHES. PALEONTOLOGISTS HAVE IDENTIFIED OVER 500 DIFFERENT GENERA AND 1 000 SPECIES OF NON AVIAN DINOSAURS. THEIR DESCENDANTS THE BIRDS NUMBER 9 000 LIVING SPECIES AND ARE THE MOST DIVERSE GROUP OF LAND VERTEBRATES.
THE LARGEST DINOSAURS WERE HERBIVORES PLANT EATERS SUCH AS APATOSAURUS AND BRACHIOSAURUS. THEY WERE THE LARGEST ANIMALS TO EVER WALK ON DRY LAND. OTHER PLANT EATERS SUCH AS IGUANODON HAD SPECIAL WEAPONS TO HELP THEM FIGHT OFF THE MEAT EATERS. FOR EXAMPLE TRICERATOPS HAD THREE HORNS ON ITS HEAD SHIELD ANKYLOSAURUS WAS COVERED IN BONEY PLATES AND STEGOSAURUS HAD SPIKES ON ITS TAIL.
THE CARNIVORES WERE BIPEDAL WALKED ON THEIR BACK LEGS THOUGH NOT AS WE DO. THEIR BODY WAS MORE TOWARDS THE HORIZONTAL BALANCED AT THE BACK BY THEIR TAIL. SOME WERE VERY LARGE LIKE TYRANNOSAURUS AND SPINOSAURUS BUT SOME WERE SMALL LIKE COMPSOGNATHUS. IT WAS THE SMALLER SIZED MEAT EATERS THAT MAY HAVE EVOLVED INTO BIRDS. THE FIRST FOSSIL BIRD ARCHAEOPTERYX HAD A SKELETON WHICH LOOKED MUCH LIKE THAT OF A DINOSAUR.
DINOSAURS WERE PRIMITIVELY BIPEDAL THEIR PROBABLE ANCESTORS WERE SMALL BIPEDAL ARCHOSAURS. THE DATE OF THE EARLY DINOSAUR GENUS EORAPTOR AT 231.4 MILLION YEARS AGO IS IMPORTANT. EORAPTOR PROBABLY RESEMBLES THE COMMON ANCESTOR OF ALL DINOSAURS ITS TRAITS SUGGEST THAT THE FIRST DINOSAURS WERE SMALL BIPEDAL PREDATORS. THE DISCOVERY OF PRIMITIVE PRE DINOSAUR TYPES IN MIDDLE TRIASSIC STRATA SUPPORTS THIS VIEW. ANALYSIS OF THEIR FOSSILS SUGGESTS THAT THE ANIMALS WERE INDEED SMALL BIPEDAL PREDATORS.
THOSE DINOSAURS WHICH RETURNED TO FOUR LEGGED STANCE KEPT ALL FOUR LEGS UNDER THEIR BODY. THIS IS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT THAN THE SPRAWLING LEGS OF A LIZARD.
THE BIG SAUROPODS COULD NEVER HAVE REACHED SO LARGE A SIZE WITHOUT THEIR PILLAR LIKE LEGS. A REVIEW SURVEYS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF DINOSAUR MOVEMENT.
A MAJOR CHANGE IN OUTLOOK CAME IN THE 1960S WHEN IT WAS REALISED THAT SMALL THEROPODS WERE PROBABLY WARM BLOODED. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER ALL THEROPODS OR EVEN ALL DINOSAURS WERE WARM BLOODED IS STILL UNDECIDED.
IT IS NOW CERTAIN FROM FOSSILS DISCOVERED IN CHINA SEE JEHOL BIOTA THAT SMALL THEROPODS HAD FEATHERS. THIS FITS WELL WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE WARM BLOODED AND THAT THE ORIGIN OF BIRDS CAN BE TRACED TO A LINE OF SMALL THEROPODS.
WARM BLOODED ANIMALS HAVE A HIGH METABOLIC RATE USE UP FOOD FASTER. THEY CAN BE MORE ACTIVE AND FOR LONGER THAN ANIMALS WHO DEPEND ON THE ENVIRONMENT FOR HEATING. THEREFORE THE IDEA OF WARM BLOODED DINOSAURS INSULATED BY FEATHERS LED TO THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE MORE ACTIVE INTELLIGENT AND FASTER RUNNERS THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.
MAIN STREAM PALAEONTOLOGISTS HAVE FOLLOWED THIS VIEW FOR SMALL THEROPODS BUT NOT FOR LARGER HERBIVORES. SINCE WE KNOW THAT THE SIZE OF A STEGOSAUR S BRAIN WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A WALNUT THERE IS GOOD REASON TO THINK ITS INTELLIGENCE WAS LIMITED.
DESPITE THEIR GREAT SUCCESS OVER A LONG PERIOD THERE WERE LIFE STYLES WHICH THE DINOSAURS NEVER EVOLVED. NONE EVER EVOLVED TO LIVE ENTIRELY IN WATER AS MANY MAMMALS DO THOUGH SPINOSAURUS WAS SEMI AQUATIC. THEY NEVER DOMINATED THE SMALL TERRESTRIAL NICHE. ALL THROUGH THE MESOZOIC MOST SMALL VERTEBRATES WERE MAMMALS AND LIZARDS.
THE EXTINCTIONS AT THE END OF THE CRETACEOUS WERE CAUSED BY ONE OR MORE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS SUCH AS MASSIVE ASTEROID OR METEORITE IMPACTS LIKE THE CHICXULUB IMPACT OR INCREASED VOLCANIC ACTIVITY.
SEVERAL IMPACT CRATERS AND MASSIVE VOLCANIC ACTIVITY SUCH AS THAT IN THE DECCAN TRAPS IN INDIA HAVE BEEN DATED TO THE APPROXIMATE TIME OF THE EXTINCTION EVENT. THESE GEOLOGICAL EVENTS MAY HAVE REDUCED SUNLIGHT AND HINDERED PHOTOSYNTHESIS LEADING TO A MASSIVE DISRUPTION IN EARTH S ECOLOGY.
DID ANY TERRESTRIAL DINOSAURS SURVIVE THE GREAT EXTINCTION EVENT SEVERAL FOSSILS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE HELL CREEK FORMATION ABOUT 40 000 YEARS LATER THAN THE K T EXTINCTION EVENT. MANY SCIENTISTS DISMISS THE PALEOCENE DINOSAURS AS RE WORKED THAT IS WASHED OUT OF THEIR ORIGINAL PLACES AND THEN RE BURIED IN MUCH LATER SEDIMENTS. AN ASSOCIATED SKELETON E.G. MORE THAN ONE BONE FROM THE SAME INDIVIDUAL FOUND ABOVE THE K T BOUNDARY WOULD BE CONVINCING BUT NO SUCH FINDS HAVE BEEN REPORTED.
BOOKS ABOUT DINOSAURS HAVE BEEN POPULAR ESPECIALLY WITH CHILDREN BUT ADULTS HAVE ALSO ENJOYED THESE KINDS OF BOOKS. IN EDWARDIAN TIMES ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE WROTE A NOVEL ABOUT A PLATEAU FILLED WITH DINOSAURS WHICH HE CALLED THE LOST WORLD.
JURASSIC PARK IN 1990 STARTED A NEW PHASE IN DINOSAUR POPULAR CULTURE WHEN IT WAS FOLLOWED BY THE MOVIE OF THE SAME NAME IN 1993.
DISEASE
A DISEASE OR MEDICAL CONDITION IS AN UNHEALTHY STATE WHERE SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS TO THE BODY OR MIND. DISEASES CAN CAUSE PAIN PARTS OF THE BODY TO STOP WORKING THE RIGHT WAY OR DEATH. THE WORD DISEASE IS SOMETIMES USED TO INCLUDE 
A DISEASE CAN BE CAUSED BY MANY THINGS. SOMETIMES GERMS ENTER OUR BODY THROUGH FOOD WATER OR AIR. A PERSON CAN BE INFECTED BY INFECTIOUS AGENTS LIKE BACTERIA VIRUSES OR FUNGUS. DISEASE CAN ALSO BE CAUSED BY EATING BAD OR OLD FOODS. THERE ARE SMALL GERMS IN OLD FOODS THAT CAN CAUSE DISEASES. SOMETIMES THE GERMS PRODUCE CHEMICALS OR TOXINS WHICH CAUSES THE DISEASE. 
ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CAUSES OF DISEASE IS POOR SANITATION AND LACK OF CLEAN WATER. SOME DEADLY DISEASES LIKE MALARIA IN TROPICAL PARTS OF THE WORLD ARE SPREAD BY A MOSQUITO. ANIMALS THAT SPREAD DISEASE ARE CALLED VECTORS. THERE ARE MANY VECTORS INCLUDING SNAILS TICKS AND FLEAS. 
SOME PEOPLE ARE BORN WITH GENETIC DISEASES. THESE ARE DISEASES BECAUSE OF AN ERROR OR MUTATION IN A PERSON S DNA. AN EXAMPLE OF A MUTATION IS CANCER. LIVING OR WORKING IN AN UNHEALTHY ENVIRONMENT CAN ALSO BE A CAUSE FOR DISEASES. DISEASES ARE MORE COMMON IN OLDER PEOPLE.
SOME DISEASES CAN BE HELPED WITH MEDICINE. INFECTIONS CAN OFTEN BE CURED BY ANTIBIOTICS THOUGH RESISTANCE TO ANTIBIOTICS IS A PROBLEM. SOME DISEASE MAY BE HELPED BY SURGERY. NOT EVERY DISEASE CAN BE HELPED WITH MEDICINE OR SURGERY THOUGH. SOME DISEASES MUST BE TREATED DURING THE WHOLE LIFE THEY ARE CHRONIC LONG LASTING DISEASES. AN EXAMPLE OF A CHRONIC DISEASE IS DIABETES MELLITUS. DIABETES CAN BE TREATED MADE BETTER BUT IT CAN NOT YET BE CURED MADE TO TOTALLY GO AWAY. PEOPLE WHO USUALLY TREAT DISEASES ARE CALLED DOCTORS OR PHYSICIANS.
SOME DISEASES THAT ARE COMMON OR VERY BAD ARE TESTED FOR EVEN IN PEOPLE WHO ARE HEALTHY. IF THESE DISEASES ARE FOUND EARLY THEY CAN BE TREATED BEFORE THEY CAUSE PROBLEMS. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE CHECKING A WOMAN FOR CERVICAL CANCER WITH A TEST CALLED A PAP SMEAR. IF CERVICAL CANCER IS FOUND EARLY IT CAN BE CURED. IF IT IS FOUND LATER IT USUALLY CAUSES DEATH. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IMMUNIZATION. THE BASIC OF IT IS TO MAKE THE BODY READY FOR A DISEASE. THE BODY HAS ITS OWN DEFENSE AGAINST DISEASE CALLED THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. ONE SPECIAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS ITS ABILITY TO REMEMBER. IF A PERSON HAD BEEN SICK BEFORE AND HAD RECOVERED THE IMMUNE SYSTEM PRODUCE A SUBSTANCE CALLED ANTIBODIES WHICH FIGHT THE DISEASE IF IT COMES BACK TO THE PERSON. THE ANTIBODY IS SPECIFIC TO A PARTICULAR DISEASE OR ANTIGEN. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS MEASLES WHICH IS A VIRUS. A PERSON USUALLY A CHILD WHO HAD NEVER BEEN SICK WITH MEASLES IS GIVEN A MILDER FORM OF THE VIRUS THIS CAUSE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES AGAINST THE VIRUS. IF THIS PERSON IS EXPOSED TO THE SAME VIRUS IN THE FUTURE THE PERSON S IMMUNE SYSTEM WILL REMEMBER AND WILL FIGHT THE VIRUS.
FOR GENERAL PREVENTION TO BE USEFUL 
EPIDEMIOLOGY IS THE STUDY OF THE CAUSE OF DISEASE. SOME DISEASES ARE MORE POPULAR FOR PEOPLE WITH COMMON CHARACTERISTICS LIKE SIMILAR ORIGINS SOCIOLOGICAL BACKGROUND FOOD OR NATIONALITY. WITHOUT GOOD EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RESEARCH SOME DISEASES CAN BE HARD TO TRACK AND TO NAME. SOME DISEASES CAN BE TAKEN FOR SOMETHING ELSE. THIS IS WHY EPIDEMIOLOGY TAKES A HUGE PART IN UNDERSTANDING HOW TO PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST VIRUSES TOXINS AND BACTERIA.
DIVORCE
A TALAQ IS A KIND OF DIVORSE WHICH ENDS A MARRIAGE IN THE EYES OF THE LAW AFTER A COUPLE DIVORCES THEY ARE NO LONGER MARRIED.
THE LAWS ARE DIFFERENT IN EVERY COUNTRY BUT USUALLY THERE ARE TWO WAYS REASONS FOR A DIVORCE IN LAW BECAUSE OF A BAD ACT BY ONE PERSON AND DIVORCE WITH NO BAD ACT. IN SOME COUNTRIES IT IS IMPORTANT WHO DID THE BAD ACT. THIS MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON DECISIONS ABOUT THE MONEY AND PROPERTY OF THE TWO PEOPLE. NORMALLY A DIVORCE COMES IN FORCE SOME TIME AFTER THE DECISION OF APPROVAL.
UNDER THIS SYSTEM DIVORCE IS POSSIBLE WITH NO ARGUMENT ABOUT A BAD ACT BY ONE OF THE MARRIED PEOPLE. IN SOME COUNTRIES IT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT THE RELATION IS BROKEN AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR IT TO BE FIXED. THIS IS TRUE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR EXAMPLE. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SAY THAT ONE OF THE MARRIED PEOPLE WAS RESPONSIBLE. THE SYSTEM LETS TWO MARRIED PEOPLE MAKE A REQUEST TOGETHER OR ONLY ONE.
IN MOST SYSTEMS OF LAW IT IS NECESSARY TO GIVE FACTS ABOUT A BAD ACT BY ONE MARRIED PERSON TO GET A DIVORCE. THE PERSON MAY GIVE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE DECISION. EXAMPLES OF THIS SORT OF REASON FOR A DIVORCE ARE 
IN SOME SYSTEMS IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET A QUICK DIVORCE WITH SIMPLE RULES. THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THEN ARE 
ABOUT 95 OF DIVORCES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE WITHOUT ARGUMENT BECAUSE THE TWO PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT ABOUT THE PROPERTY THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS AND OTHER QUESTIONS. THE AGREEMENT MAY BE MADE WITH THE HELP OF LAWYERS EXPERTS ON LAWS.
IN SOME COUNTRIES THERE ARE SPECIAL SYSTEMS WHICH GIVE HELP TO PEOPLE. FOR EXAMPLE THEY ARE ABLE TO GO A HEARING WITH A JUDGE BUT NO LAWYERS. LAWYERS MAY HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PEOPLE TO MAKE AN AGREEMENT. IN SOME SYSTEMS AN EXPERT WITH EXPERIENCE OF DIVORCES MAKES DECISIONS IN PLACE OF A JUDGE. 
IN RUSSIA TWO PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET A DIVORCE IN THE OFFICE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT KEEPS RECORDS OF BIRTHS MARRIAGES AND DEATHS. ONE PERSON OR THE TWO MARRIED PERSONS MAKE THE REQUEST AND IT WILL BE GIVEN IF 
THEN THE OFFICE WILL GIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE REQUEST TO THE OTHER PERSON. AFTER THIS TIME THE OTHER PERSON HAS ONE MONTH TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT IN WRITING AGAINST THE REQUEST. THEN THE OFFICE WILL PUT A STOP TO THE REQUEST.
A DIVORCE CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL SOME PEOPLE BECOME DEPRESSED OR SAD AFTER A DIVORCE. IF THERE ARE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN MAY ALSO FEEL SAD WHEN THE PARENTS ARE DIVORCED. HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY RESOURCES THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE DIVORCING SUCH AS THERAPISTS COUNSELLORS BOOKS AND DVDS.
THE BIGGEST IMPACT IS ALWAYS FELT THE CHILDREN WHO ARE OFTEN FORCE TO GROW UP WITH ONLY ONE PARENT. THIS REACHES ITS CLIMAX WHEN THE ONE PARENT TAKING CARE OF THE CHILD IS FORCE TO WORK ALL DAY AND DOESN T HAVE TIME FOR THE CHILD. CHILDREN WHO HAVE BROKEN HOMES ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT
IF THE PARENTS RE MARRY THE CHILDREN OF THEIR NEW HUSBAND OR WIFE ARE THEIR STEPCHILDREN. STEP CAN BE PUT BEFORE ANY RELATION TO SHOW IT IS FROM ANOTHER MARRIAGE. IF THERE ARE CHILDREN IN THE NEW MARRIAGE CHILDREN FROM A FORMER MARRIAGE ARE CALLED HALF BROTHERS OR HALF SISTERS SINCE THEY ARE HALF RELATED.
THE LAW OF DIVORCE IS DIFFERENT IN EVERY COUNTRY. ONLY TWO COUNTRIES HAVE NO LAW OF DIVORCE THE PHILIPPINES AND THE VATICAN. IN THE PHILIPPINES MARRIED PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO END THEIR RELATION BUT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO SAY THEY WERE NEVER MARRIED FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE OF AN ERROR. MOST RELIGIONS DO NOT AGREE WITH THE COUPLES DIVORCING.
DOLPHIN
DOLPHINS ARE MAMMALS IN THE ORDER CETACEA. THEY ARE PART OF THE TOOTHED WHALES. GENERALLY THEY ARE AMONG THE SMALLER WHALES. MOST LIVE IN SALT WATER OCEANS BUT SOME LIVE IN RIVERS THERE ARE OCEANIC DOLPHINS AND RIVER DOLPHINS. DOLPHINS ARE FROM TO LONG BUT THE LARGEST DOLPHIN THE KILLER WHALE OR ORCA CAN BE UP TO LONG.
THE NAME DOLPHIN COMES FROM THE ANCIENT GREEK DELPHIS MEANING WITH A WOMB BECAUSE IT WAS FIRST THOUGHT TO BE A FISH WITH A WOMB. IT IS NOW KNOWN TO BE A MAMMAL AND QUITE AN INTELLIGENT MAMMAL. DOLPHINS BREATHE AIR. A DOLPHIN S NOSE IS ON TOP OF ITS HEAD SO THE DOLPHIN CAN EASILY BREATHE ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER. THE SKIN OF A DOLPHIN HAS NO SCALES. IT IS SOFT AND SMOOTH. HOWEVER IT IS VERY FIRM DUE TO HOW MUCH MUSCLE THEY HAVE. DOLPHINS USE ECHOLOCATION TO FIND THEIR FOOD.
DOLPHINS SWIM IN PODS A VERY LARGE POD IS CALLED A HERD. THEY ARE VERY SOCIAL AND HELP EACH OTHER FIGHT OFF PREDATORS. DOLPHINS HAVE FOUGHT OFF SHARKS IN THIS WAY. THEY CAN KILL LARGE SHARKS BY THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH THEIR SNOUTS AND HEADS. THEY LOOK AFTER THE YOUNG WHEN THE MOTHERS NEED TO LEAVE THEIR CALVES TO HUNT FOR FOOD. THE YOUNG NEED TO BREATHE MORE OFTEN THAN THE ADULTS AND THE FOOD MAY BE IN DEEPER WATERS.
OCEANIC DOLPHINS ARE MARINE ANIMALS LIVING IN THE SEA. THEY LIVE IN ALL OF THE OCEANS.
THREE OF THE FOUR SPECIES OF RIVER DOLPHINS LIVE IN FRESH WATER RIVERS. THE LA PLATA DOLPHIN LIVES IN SALTWATER ESTUARIES AND THE OCEAN. WATER POLLUTION AND THE LOSS OF HABITAT ARE A THREAT TO SOME DOLPHINS ESPECIALLY THOSE LIVING IN RIVERS AND ESTUARIES.
DOLPHINS DO NOT SLEEP IN A NORMAL WAY. THEY HAVE TWO SIDES OF THEIR BRAIN WHICH THEY USE TO SLEEP. ONE SIDE SLEEPS WHILE THE OTHER SIDE STAYS AWAKE. THEY WILL KEEP ONE EYE OPEN TO WATCH FOR PREDATORS WHILE THEY SLEEP.
DOLPHINS AND OTHER CETACEANS SLEEP IN THE WATER. THERE IS DANGER FROM SHARKS. WHILE SLEEPING IN WATER THE ANIMALS GO THROUGH DIFFERENT STAGES OF SLEEP. THEY DO SOME BEHAVIOURS DURING SLEEP THEY COME TO THE SURFACE OCCASIONALLY TO BREATHE AND THEY HAVE AN EYE OPEN MOST OF THE TIME. THE DETAILS VARY IN DIFFERENT SPECIES OR GROUPS. PREDATOR DETECTION IS THE OBVIOUS FUNCTION OF THIS BEHAVIOUR. SIMILAR ADAPTATIONS ARE FOUND IN PINNIPEDS LIKE SEALS.
THE BRAIN OF A DOLPHIN IS LIKE A HUMAN BRAIN IN SIZE AND DEVELOPMENT. DOLPHINS HAVE REASONABLE EYESIGHT. THEY CAN WATCH A THING IN THE WATER AND THEY CAN SEE COLORS TOO. THEY CAN ALSO SEE IN DARK PLACES. 
A DOLPHIN S HEARING IS BETTER THAN THEIR SIGHT. THERE ARE SMALL HOLES BEHIND THE EYES AND THEY ARE THE EARS OF A DOLPHIN. DOLPHINS CAN HEAR A SOUND UNDERWATER. THEY CAN KNOW THE DIRECTION OF THE SOUND VERY WELL.
DOLPHINS HAVE LONG PLAYED A ROLE IN HUMAN CULTURE. DOLPHINS ARE COMMON IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY AND THERE ARE MANY COINS FROM ANCIENT GREECE WHICH FEATURE A MAN OR BOY OR DEITY RIDING ON THE BACK OF A DOLPHIN. THE ANCIENT GREEKS WELCOMED DOLPHINS SPOTTING DOLPHINS RIDING IN A SHIP S WAKE WAS CONSIDERED A GOOD OMEN. IN HINDU MYTHOLOGY THE GANGES RIVER DOLPHIN IS ASSOCIATED WITH GANGA THE DEITY OF THE GANGES RIVER.
DOLPHIN MEAT IS EATEN IN A FEW COUNTRIES INCLUDING JAPAN AND PERU WHERE IT IS REFERRED TO AS CHANCHO MARINO OR SEA PORK. JAPAN MAY BE THE BEST KNOWN AND MOST CONTROVERSIAL EXAMPLE BUT EATING DOLPHIN IS NOT THAT COMMON.
DOLPHIN THERAPY IS SOMETIMES USED FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL OR PHYSICAL HANDICAPS. IT INVOLVES CONTACT WITH TRAINED DOLPHINS. IT IS NOT AGREED WHETHER THIS IS ANY BETTER THAN THE USUAL TREATMENTS.
SCIENTISTS CONTINUE TO STUDY DOLPHIN THERAPY.
SOME EXAMPLES 
EARTH
EARTH IS THE PLANET WE LIVE ON. IT IS THE THIRD PLANET FROM THE SUN. IT IS THE ONLY PLANET KNOWN TO HAVE LIFE ON IT. LOTS OF SCIENTISTS THINK THE EARTH FORMED AROUND 4.5 BILLION YEARS AGO. IT IS ONE OF FOUR ROCKY PLANETS ON THE INSIDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THE OTHER THREE ARE MERCURY VENUS AND MARS.
THE LARGE MASS OF THE SUN MAKES EARTH MOVE AROUND IT JUST AS THE MASS OF EARTH MAKES THE MOON MOVE AROUND IT. EARTH ALSO TURNS AROUND IN SPACE SO THAT DIFFERENT PARTS FACE THE SUN AT DIFFERENT TIMES. EARTH GOES AROUND THE SUN ONCE ONE YEAR FOR EVERY 365 TIMES IT TURNS ALL THE WAY AROUND ONE DAY.
EARTH IS THE ONLY PLANET IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM THAT HAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF LIQUID WATER. ABOUT 71 OF THE SURFACE OF EARTH IS COVERED BY OCEANS. BECAUSE OF THIS PEOPLE SOMETIMES CALL IT BLUE PLANET.
BECAUSE OF ITS WATER EARTH IS HOME TO MILLIONS OF SPECIES OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS. THE THINGS THAT LIVE ON EARTH HAVE CHANGED ITS SURFACE GREATLY. FOR EXAMPLE EARLY CYANOBACTERIA CHANGED THE AIR AND GAVE IT OXYGEN. THE LIVING PART OF EARTH S SURFACE IS CALLED THE BIOSPHERE.
EARTH IS PART OF THE EIGHT PLANETS AND MANY THOUSANDS OF SMALL BODIES THAT MOVE AROUND THE SUN AS ITS SOLAR SYSTEM. THE SOLAR SYSTEM IS MOVING THROUGH THE ORION ARM OF THE MILKY WAY GALAXY NOW AND WILL BE FOR ABOUT THE NEXT 10 000 YEARS.
EARTH IS ABOUT AWAY FROM THE SUN THIS DISTANCE IS CALLED AN ASTRONOMICAL UNIT. EARTH MOVES ON ITS ORBIT AT AN AVERAGE SPEED OF ABOUT A SECOND. EARTH TURNS ALL THE WAY AROUND ABOUT 365 TIMES IN THE TIME IT TAKES FOR EARTH TO GO ALL THE WAY AROUND THE SUN. TO MAKE UP THIS EXTRA BIT OF A DAY EVERY YEAR AN ADDITIONAL DAY IS USED EVERY FOUR YEARS. THIS IS NAMED A LEAP YEAR.
THE MOON GOES AROUND EARTH AT AN AVERAGE DISTANCE OF. IT IS LOCKED TO EARTH SO THAT IT ALWAYS HAS THE SAME HALF FACING EARTH THE OTHER HALF IS CALLED THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. IT TAKES ABOUT 27 DAYS FOR THE MOON TO GO ALL THE WAY AROUND EARTH BUT BECAUSE EARTH IS MOVING AROUND THE SUN AT THE SAME TIME IT TAKES ABOUT 29 DAYS FOR THE MOON TO GO FROM DARK TO BRIGHT TO DARK AGAIN. THIS IS WHERE THE WORD MONTH CAME FROM EVEN THOUGH MOST MONTHS NOW HAVE 30 OR 31 DAYS.
EARTH AND THE OTHER PLANETS FORMED ABOUT 4.6 BILLION YEARS AGO. THEY WERE MADE OF THE LEFTOVER GAS FROM THE NEBULA THAT MADE THE SUN. THE MOON MAY HAVE BEEN FORMED AFTER A COLLISION BETWEEN THE EARLY EARTH AND A SMALLER PLANET SOMETIMES CALLED THEIA. SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT PARTS OF BOTH PLANETS BROKE OFF BECOMING BY GRAVITY THE MOON.
EARTH S WATER CAME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES. CONDENSING WATER VAPOUR AND COMETS AND ASTEROIDS HITTING EARTH MADE THE OCEANS. WITHIN A BILLION YEARS THAT IS AT ABOUT 3.6 BILLION YEARS AGO THE FIRST LIFE EVOLVED IN THE ARCHAEAN ERA. SOME BACTERIA DEVELOPED PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH LETS PLANTS MAKE FOOD FROM THE SUN S LIGHT AND WATER. THIS RELEASED A LOT OF OXYGEN WHICH WAS FIRST TAKEN UP BY IRON IN SOLUTION. EVENTUALLY FREE OXYGEN GOT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE OR AIR MAKING EARTH S SURFACE SUITABLE FOR AEROBIC LIFE SEE GREAT OXYGENATION EVENT. THIS OXYGEN ALSO FORMED THE OZONE LAYER WHICH PROTECTS EARTH S SURFACE FROM BAD ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION FROM THE SUN. COMPLEX LIFE ON THE SURFACE OF THE LAND DID NOT EXIST BEFORE THE OZONE LAYER.
EARTH WAS VERY DIFFERENT IN THE DISTANT PAST. LONG AGO ALMOST ALL LAND WAS IN ONE PLACE. THIS IS CALLED A SUPERCONTINENT. THE EARLIEST KNOWN SUPERCONTINENT WAS CALLED VAALBARA. MUCH LATER THERE WAS A TIME THE CRYOGENIAN WHEN EARTH WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY COVERED BY THICK ICE SHEETS GLACIERS. THIS IS CALLED THE SNOWBALL EARTH THEORY.
EARTH IS ROCKY. IT IS THE LARGEST OF THE ROCKY PLANETS MOVING AROUND THE SUN BY MASS AND BY SIZE. IT IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE GAS GIANTS SUCH AS JUPITER.
OVERALL EARTH IS MADE OF IRON 32.1 OXYGEN 30.1 SILICON 15.1 MAGNESIUM 13.9 SULFUR 2.9 NICKEL 1.8 CALCIUM 1.5 AND ALUMINIUM 1.4. THE 1.2 LEFT OVER IS MADE OF MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF OTHER CHEMICALS. CHEMICALS THAT ARE VERY UNCOMMON SUCH AS GOLD AND PLATINUM CAN BE VERY VALUABLE.
THE STRUCTURE OF EARTH CHANGES FROM THE INSIDE TO THE OUTSIDE. THE CENTER OF EARTH EARTH S CORE IS MOSTLY IRON 88.8 NICKEL 5.8 SULFUR 4.5 AND LESS THAN 1 OTHER THINGS. THE EARTH S CRUST IS LARGELY OXYGEN 47. OXYGEN IS NORMALLY A GAS BUT IT CAN JOIN WITH OTHER CHEMICALS TO MAKE COMPOUNDS LIKE WATER AND ROCKS. 99.22 OF ROCKS HAVE OXYGEN IN THEM. THE MOST COMMON OXYGEN HAVING ROCKS ARE SILICA MADE WITH SILICON ALUMINA MADE WITH ALUMINIUM RUST MADE WITH IRON LIME MADE WITH CALCIUM MAGNESIA MADE WITH MAGNESIUM POTASH MADE WITH POTASSIUM AND SODIUM OXIDE AND THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL.
EARTH S SHAPE IS A SPHEROID NOT QUITE A SPHERE BECAUSE IT IS SLIGHTLY SQUASHED ON THE TOP AND BOTTOM. THE SHAPE IS CALLED AN OBLATE SPHEROID. AS EARTH SPINS AROUND ITSELF THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE FORCES THE EQUATOR OUT A LITTLE AND PULLS THE POLES IN A LITTLE. THE EQUATOR AROUND THE MIDDLE OF EARTH S SURFACE IS ABOUT LONG. 
THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN ABOVE SEA LEVEL THE WELL KNOWN MOUNT EVEREST WHICH IS ABOVE SEA LEVEL IS NOT ACTUALLY THE ONE THAT IS THE FARTHEST AWAY FROM THE CENTER OF THE EARTH. INSTEAD THE SLEEPING VOLCANO MOUNT CHIMBORAZO IN ECUADOR IS IT IS ONLY ABOVE SEA LEVEL BUT IT IS ALMOST AT THE EQUATOR. BECAUSE OF THIS MOUNT CHIMBORAZO IS FROM THE CENTER OF THE EARTH WHILE MOUNT EVEREST IS CLOSER TO IT. SIMILARLY THE LOWEST POINT BELOW SEA LEVEL THAT WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF IS THE CHALLENGER DEEP IN THE MARIANA TRENCH IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN. IT IS ABOUT BELOW SEA LEVEL BUT AGAIN THERE ARE PROBABLY PLACES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN THAT ARE NEARER TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.
THE DEEPEST HOLE EVER DUG IS ONLY ABOUT. WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE INSIDE OF THE EARTH THOUGH BECAUSE WE CAN LEARN THINGS FROM EARTHQUAKES AND THE TIMES WHEN VOLCANOES ERUPT. WE ARE ABLE TO SEE HOW QUICKLY THE SHOCK WAVES MOVE THROUGH EARTH IN DIFFERENT PLACES.
THE INSIDE OF EARTH IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE OUTSIDE. ALMOST ALL OF EARTH S LIQUID WATER IS IN THE SEAS OR CLOSE TO THE SURFACE. THE SURFACE ALSO HAS A LOT OF OXYGEN WHICH COMES FROM PLANTS. SMALL AND SIMPLE KINDS OF LIFE CAN LIVE FAR UNDER THE SURFACE BUT ANIMALS AND PLANTS ONLY LIVE ON THE SURFACE OR IN THE SEAS. THE ROCKS ON THE SURFACE OF EARTH EARTH S CRUST ARE WELL KNOWN. THEY ARE THICKER WHERE THERE IS LAND BETWEEN THICK. UNDER THE SEAS THEY ARE SOMETIMES ONLY THICK. THERE ARE THREE GROUPS OF ROCKS THAT MAKE UP MOST OF THE EARTH S CRUST. SOME ROCK IS MADE WHEN THE HOT LIQUID ROCK COMES FROM INSIDE THE EARTH IGNEOUS ROCKS ANOTHER TYPE OF ROCK IS MADE WHEN SEDIMENT IS LAID DOWN USUALLY UNDER THE SEA SEDIMENTARY ROCKS AND A THIRD KIND OF ROCK IS MADE WHEN THE OTHER TWO ARE CHANGED BY VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE OR PRESSURE METAMORPHIC ROCKS. A VERY FEW ROCKS ALSO FALL OUT OF THE SKY METEORITES.
BELOW THE CRUST IS WARM AND ALMOST LIQUID ROCK THAT IS ALWAYS MOVING AROUND THE EARTH S MANTLE. THEN THERE IS A THIN LIQUID LAYER OF HEATED ROCK THE OUTER CORE. THIS IS VERY HOT. THE MIDDLE OF THE INSIDE OF THE EARTH WOULD BE LIQUID AS WELL BUT ALL THE WEIGHT OF THE ROCK ABOVE IT PUSHES IT BACK INTO BEING SOLID. THIS SOLID MIDDLE PART THE INNER CORE IS ALMOST ALL IRON. THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE EARTH MAGNETIC.
THE EARTH S CRUST IS SOLID BUT MADE OF PARTS WHICH MOVE VERY SLOWLY. THE THIN LEVEL OF HARD ROCK ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE EARTH RESTS ON HOT LIQUID MATERIAL BELOW IT IN THE DEEPER MANTLE. THIS LIQUID MATERIAL MOVES BECAUSE IT GETS HEAT FROM THE HOT CENTER OF THE EARTH. THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF THE PLATES IS WHAT CAUSES EARTHQUAKES VOLCANOES AND LARGE GROUPS OF MOUNTAINS ON THE EARTH.
THERE ARE THREE WAYS PLATES CAN COME TOGETHER. TWO PLATES CAN MOVE TOWARDS EACH OTHER CONVERGENT PLATE EDGES. THIS CAN FORM ISLANDS SUCH AS JAPAN VOLCANOES AND HIGH MOUNTAIN RANGES SUCH AS THE ANDES AND HIMALAYAS. TWO PLATES CAN MOVE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER DIVERGENT PLATE EDGES. THIS GIVES THE WARM LIQUID ROCK INSIDE THE EARTH A PLACE TO COME OUT. THIS MAKES SPECIAL MOUNTAIN RANGES BELOW THE SEA OR LARGE LOW LANDS LIKE AFRICA S GREAT RIFT VALLEY. PLATES ARE ABLE TO MOVE BESIDE EACH OTHER AS WELL TRANSFORM PLATE EDGES SUCH AS THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT. THIS MAKES THEIR EDGES CRUSH AGAINST EACH OTHER AND MAKES MANY SHOCKS AS THEY MOVE.
THE OUTSIDE OF THE EARTH IS NOT EVEN. THERE ARE HIGH PLACES CALLED MOUNTAINS AND HIGH FLAT PLACES CALLED PLATEAUS. THERE ARE LOW PLACES CALLED VALLEYS AND CANYONS. FOR THE MOST PART MOVING AIR AND WATER FROM THE SKY AND SEAS DAMAGES ROCKS IN HIGH PLACES AND BREAKS THEM INTO SMALL PIECES. THE AIR AND WATER THEN MOVE THESE PIECES TO LOWER PLACES. BECAUSE OF THIS THE EARTH WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY FLAT A LONG TIME BEFORE NOW. THE FUNDAMENTAL CAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE EARTH S SURFACE IS PLATE TECTONICS.
ALL PLACES ON EARTH ARE MADE OF OR ARE ON TOP OF ROCKS. THE OUTSIDE OF THE EARTH IS USUALLY NOT UNCOVERED ROCK. OVER 70 OF THE EARTH IS COVERED BY SEAS FULL OF SALTY WATER. THIS SALTY WATER MAKES UP ABOUT 97 OF ALL EARTH S WATER. THE FRESH WATER PEOPLE CAN DRINK IS MOSTLY ICE. ONLY A VERY SMALL AMOUNT IS IN RIVERS AND UNDER THE EARTH FOR PEOPLE TO DRINK AND USE. THE AIR ABOVE THE EARTH STOPS THE WATER FROM GOING AWAY INTO OUTER SPACE. ALSO MUCH OF THE LAND ON EARTH IS COVERED WITH PLANTS OR WITH WHAT IS LEFT FROM EARLIER LIVING THINGS. PLACES WITH VERY LITTLE RAIN ARE DRY WASTES CALLED DESERTS. DESERTS USUALLY HAVE FEW LIVING THINGS BUT LIFE IS ABLE TO GROW VERY QUICKLY WHEN THESE WASTES HAVE RAINFALL. PLACES WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF RAIN MAY BE LARGE WOODS. LATELY PEOPLE HAVE CHANGED THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE EARTH A GREAT DEAL.
ALL AROUND THE EARTH IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF AIR THE ATMOSPHERE. THE MASS OF THE EARTH PULLS THE GASSES IN THE AIR DOWN AND DOES NOT LET THEM GO INTO OUTER SPACE. THE AIR IS MOSTLY MADE OF NITROGEN ABOUT 78 AND OXYGEN ABOUT 21 BUT THERE ARE A FEW OTHER GASSES AS WELL. MOST LIVING THINGS NEED THE AIR OR PARTS OF THE AIR GRIPPED IN THE WATER TO BREATHE AND LIVE. THEY USE THE GASSES ESPECIALLY OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE TO MAKE AND USE SUGAR AND TO GIVE THEMSELVES POWER.
THE AIR ANIMALS AND PLANTS USE TO LIVE IS ONLY THE FIRST LEVEL OF THE AIR AROUND THE EARTH THE TROPOSPHERE. THE DAY TO DAY CHANGES IN THIS LEVEL OF AIR ARE NAMED WEATHER THE CHANGES BETWEEN PLACES FAR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AND FROM YEAR TO YEAR ARE NAMED THE CLIMATE. RAIN AND STORMS ARE BOTH IN THIS LEVEL. BOTH COME ABOUT BECAUSE THIS PART OF THE AIR GETS COLDER AS IT GOES UP. COLD AIR BECOMES THICKER AND FALLS AND WARM AIR BECOMES THINNER AND GOES UP. THE TURNING EARTH MOVES THE AIR AS WELL AND AIR MOVES NORTH AND SOUTH BECAUSE THE MIDDLE OF THE EARTH GENERALLY GETS MORE POWER FROM THE SUN AND IS WARMER THAN THE NORTH AND SOUTH POINTS. AT THE SAME TIME AIR OVER WATER SPECIALLY VERY WARM WATER GETS WATER IN IT BUT BECAUSE COLD AIR IS NOT ABLE TO TAKE IN AS MUCH WATER IT STARTS TO MAKE CLOUDS AND RAIN AS IT GETS COLDER. THE WAY WATER MOVES AROUND IN A CIRCLE LIKE THIS IS CALLED THE WATER CYCLE.
ABOVE THIS FIRST LEVEL THERE ARE FOUR OTHER LEVELS. THE AIR GETS COLDER AS IT GOES UP IN THE FIRST LEVEL IN THE SECOND LEVEL THE STRATOSPHERE THE AIR GETS WARMER AS IT GOES UP. THIS LEVEL HAS A SPECIAL KIND OF OXYGEN CALLED OZONE. THE OZONE IN THIS AIR KEEPS LIVING THINGS SAFE FROM DAMAGING RAYS FROM THE SUN. THE POWER FROM THESE RAYS IS WHAT MAKES THIS LEVEL WARMER AND WARMER. THE MIDDLE LEVEL THE MESOSPHERE GETS COLDER AND COLDER WITH HEIGHT THE FOURTH LEVEL THE THERMOSPHERE GETS WARMER AND WARMER AND THE LAST LEVEL THE EXOSPHERE IS ALMOST OUTER SPACE AND HAS VERY LITTLE AIR AT ALL. IT REACHES ABOUT HALF THE WAY TO THE MOON. THE THREE OUTER LEVELS HAVE A LOT OF ELECTRIC POWER MOVING THROUGH THEM THIS IS CALLED THE IONOSPHERE AND IS IMPORTANT FOR RADIO AND OTHER ELECTRIC WAVES IN THE AIR. IT IS ALSO WHERE THE NORTHERN LIGHTS ARE.
EVEN THOUGH AIR SEEMS VERY LIGHT THE WEIGHT OF ALL OF THE AIR ABOVE THE OUTSIDE OF THE EARTH AIR PRESSURE IS IMPORTANT. GENERALLY FROM SEA LEVEL TO THE TOP OF THE OUTER LEVEL OF THE AIR A SPACE OF AIR ONE SQUARE CENTIMETER ACROSS HAS A MASS OF ABOUT 1.03 KG AND A SPACE OF AIR ONE SQUARE INCH ACROSS HAS A WEIGHT OF ABOUT 14.7 POUNDS. THE MASS OF THE AIR ALSO KEEPS THE EARTH SAFE WHEN ROCKS METEORITES HIT IT FROM OUTER SPACE. WITHOUT THE AIR THE DAMAGE METEORITES DO WOULD BE MUCH GREATER. BECAUSE OF THE AIR METEORITES GENERALLY BURN UP LONG BEFORE THEY GET TO THE EARTH.
THE AIR ALSO KEEPS THE EARTH WARM SPECIALLY THE HALF TURNED AWAY FROM THE SUN. SOME GASSES ESPECIALLY METHANE AND CARBON DIOXIDE WORK LIKE A BLANKET TO KEEP THINGS WARM. IN THE PAST THE EARTH HAS BEEN MUCH WARMER AND MUCH COLDER THAN IT IS NOW. SINCE PEOPLE HAVE GROWN USED TO THE HEAT WE HAVE NOW THOUGH WE DO NOT WANT THE EARTH TO BE TOO MUCH WARMER OR COLDER. MOST OF THE WAYS PEOPLE CREATE ELECTRIC POWER USE BURNING KINDS OF CARBON ESPECIALLY COAL OIL AND NATURAL GAS. BURNING THESE CREATES NEW CARBON DIOXIDE AND CAN CAUSE MORE WARMING. A LARGE DISCUSSION IS GOING ON NOW ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD DO ABOUT THE EARTH S LATEST WARMING WHICH HAS GONE ON FOR ABOUT 150 YEARS. SO FAR THIS WARMING HAS BEEN GOOD FOR PEOPLE PLANTS HAVE GROWN BETTER AND THE WEATHER HAS BEEN BETTER THAN WHEN IT WAS COLDER BEFORE. SOME PEOPLE WHO LEARN ABOUT SCIENCE THOUGH SAY THAT MANY BAD THINGS WILL POSSIBLY COME ABOUT IF THE WARMING GOES ON.
ABOUT SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE LIVE ON EARTH. THEY LIVE IN ABOUT 200 DIFFERENT LANDS CALLED COUNTRIES. SOME LIKE RUSSIA ARE LARGE WITH MANY LARGE CITIES. OTHERS LIKE THE VATICAN ARE SMALL. THE FIVE COUNTRIES WITH THE MOST PEOPLE ARE CHINA INDIA THE UNITED STATES INDONESIA AND BRAZIL. ABOUT 90 OF PEOPLE LIVE IN THE NORTH HALF OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS MOST OF THE LAND. SCIENTISTS THINK THAT PEOPLE ORIGINALLY CAME FROM AFRICA. NOW 70 OF ALL PEOPLE DO NOT LIVE IN AFRICA BUT IN EUROPE AND ASIA.
PEOPLE CHANGE THE EARTH IN MANY WAYS. THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GROW PLANTS FOR FOOD AND CLOTHES FOR ABOUT TEN THOUSAND YEARS. WHEN THERE WAS ENOUGH FOOD THEY WERE ABLE TO BUILD TOWNS AND CITIES. NEAR THESE PLACES MEN AND WOMEN WERE ABLE TO CHANGE RIVERS BRING WATER TO FARMS AND STOP FLOODS RISING WATER FROM COMING OVER THEIR LAND. PEOPLE FOUND USEFUL ANIMALS AND BRED THEM SO THEY WERE EASIER TO KEEP.
EARTHQUAKE
AN EARTHQUAKE OR QUAKES TREMORS IS THE SHAKING OF THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH. THEY ARE CAUSED BY SUDDEN MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH S TECTONIC PLATES. EARTHQUAKES CAN BE EXTREMELY VIOLENT OR SO SLIGHT THAT THEY ONLY REGISTER ON INSTRUMENTS.
THE STUDY OF EARTHQUAKES IS CALLED SEISMOLOGY. EARTHQUAKES ARE USUALLY QUITE BRIEF BUT MAY REPEAT. THE SUDDEN RELEASE OF TENSION IN THE TECTONIC PLATES SENDS WAVES OF ENERGY THAT TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH. SEISMOLOGY STUDIES THE CAUSE FREQUENCY TYPE AND SIZE OF EARTHQUAKES. 
THERE ARE LARGE EARTHQUAKES AND SMALL EARTHQUAKES. LARGE EARTHQUAKES CAN TAKE DOWN BUILDINGS AND CAUSE DEATH AND INJURY. EARTHQUAKES ARE MEASURED USING OBSERVATIONS FROM SEISMOMETERS. THE MAGNITUDE OF AN EARTHQUAKE AND THE INTENSITY OF SHAKING IS USUALLY REPORTED ON THE RICHTER SCALE. THE RICHTER SCALE WAS INVENTED BY CHARLES FRANCIS RICHTER IN 1935. ON THE SCALE 2 IS SCARCELY NOTICEABLE AND MAGNITUDE 5 OR MORE CAUSES DAMAGE OVER A WIDE AREA.
AN EARTHQUAKE UNDER THE OCEAN CAN CAUSE A TSUNAMI. THIS CAN CAUSE JUST AS MUCH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION AS THE EARTHQUAKE ITSELF. LANDSLIDES CAN HAPPEN TOO. EARTHQUAKES ARE PART OF THE EARTH S ROCK CYCLE. THE IMPACT CAN BE MEASURED BY A SEISMOMETER. IT DETECTS THE VIBRATIONS CAUSED BY AN EARTHQUAKE. IT PUTS THESE MOVEMENT ON A SEISMOGRAPH. THE STRENGTH OR MAGNITUDE OF AN EARTHQUAKE IS MEASURED USING THE RICHTER SCALE. THE RICHTER SCALE IS NUMBERED 0 9.
SCIENTISTS CANNOT A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE BEFOREHAND. THEY DO KNOW WHERE EARTHQUAKES MAY OCCUR SUCH AS CLOSE TO THE FAULT LINES. 
ADVICE ON WHAT TO DO IN AN EARTHQUAKE 
IF YOU ARE OUTDOORS 
EARTHQUAKES SOMETIMES HIT CITIES AND KILL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. MOST EARTHQUAKES HAPPEN ALONG THE PACIFIC RING OF FIRE BUT THE BIGGEST ONES MOSTLY HAPPEN IN OTHER PLACES. TECTONICALLY ACTIVE PLACES ARE PLACES WHERE EARTHQUAKES OR VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS ARE FREQUENT.
THE ANCIENT CHINESE USED A DEVICE THAT LOOKED LIKE A JAR WITH DRAGONS ON THE TOP SURROUNDED BY FROGS WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN. WHEN AN EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED A BALL IN EACH DRAGON S MOUTH WOULD DROP OUT OF THE DRAGON S MOUTH INTO THE FROG S. THE POSITION OF THE FROG WHICH RECEIVED A BALL INDICATED THE DIRECTION OF THE EARTHQUAKE. THIS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TOOLS TO HELP FIGURE OUT WHERE AN EARTHQUAKE ORIGINATED FROM.
EARTHQUAKES ARE CAUSED BY TECTONIC MOVEMENTS IN THE EARTH S CRUST. THE MAIN CAUSE IS THAT WHEN TECTONIC PLATES ONE RIDES OVER THE OTHER CAUSING OROGENY COLLIDE MOUNTAIN BUILDING EARTHQUAKES.
THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN MOVING PLATES FORM THE LARGEST FAULT SURFACES ON EARTH. WHEN THEY STICK RELATIVE MOTION BETWEEN THE PLATES LEADS TO INCREASING STRESS. THIS CONTINUES UNTIL THE STRESS RISES AND BREAKS SUDDENLY ALLOWING SLIDING OVER THE LOCKED PORTION OF THE FAULT RELEASING THE STORED ENERGY AS SHOCK WAVES. SUCH FAULTS ARE SAN ANDREAS FAULT IN SAN FRANCISCO RIFT VALLEY IN AFRICA ETC
THERE ARE THREE MAIN TYPES OF GEOLOGICAL FAULT THAT MAY CAUSE AN EARTHQUAKE NORMAL REVERSE THRUST AND STRIKE SLIP. NORMAL FAULTS OCCUR MAINLY IN AREAS WHERE THE CRUST IS BEING EXTENDED. REVERSE FAULTS OCCUR IN AREAS WHERE THE CRUST IS BEING SHORTENED. STRIKE SLIP FAULTS ARE STEEP STRUCTURES WHERE THE TWO SIDES OF THE FAULT SLIP HORIZONTALLY PAST EACH OTHER.
MOST EARTHQUAKES FORM PART OF A SEQUENCE RELATED TO EACH OTHER IN TERMS OF LOCATION AND TIME. MOST EARTHQUAKE CLUSTERS CONSIST OF SMALL TREMORS WHICH CAUSE LITTLE TO NO DAMAGE BUT THERE IS A THEORY THAT EARTHQUAKES CAN RECUR IN A REGULAR PATTERN.
A FORESHOCK IS AN EARTHQUAKE THAT OCCURS BEFORE A LARGER EARTHQUAKE CALLED THE MAINSHOCK. 
AN AFTERSHOCK IS AN EARTHQUAKE THAT OCCURS AFTER A PREVIOUS EARTHQUAKE THE MAINSHOCK. AN AFTERSHOCK IS IN THE SAME REGION OF THE MAIN SHOCK BUT ALWAYS OF A SMALLER MAGNITUDE. AFTERSHOCKS ARE FORMED AS THE CRUST ADJUSTS TO THE EFFECTS OF THE MAIN SHOCK.
EARTHQUAKE SWARMS ARE SEQUENCES OF EARTHQUAKES STRIKING IN A SPECIFIC AREA WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM EARTHQUAKES FOLLOWED BY A SERIES OF AFTERSHOCKS BY THE FACT THAT NO SINGLE EARTHQUAKE IN THE SEQUENCE IS OBVIOUSLY THE MAIN SHOCK THEREFORE NONE HAVE NOTABLY HIGHER MAGNITUDES THAN THE OTHER. AN EXAMPLE OF AN EARTHQUAKE SWARM IS THE 2004 ACTIVITY AT YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK.
SOMETIMES A SERIES OF EARTHQUAKES OCCUR IN A SORT OF EARTHQUAKE STORM WHERE THE EARTHQUAKES STRIKE A FAULT IN CLUSTERS EACH TRIGGERED BY THE SHAKING OR STRESS REDISTRIBUTION OF THE PREVIOUS EARTHQUAKES. SIMILAR TO AFTERSHOCKS BUT ON ADJACENT SEGMENTS OF FAULT THESE STORMS OCCUR OVER THE COURSE OF YEARS AND WITH SOME OF THE LATER EARTHQUAKES AS DAMAGING AS THE EARLY ONES. SUCH A PATTERN OCCURRED IN THE NORTH ANATOLIAN FAULT IN TURKEY IN THE 20TH CENTURY.
TSUNAMI OR A CHAIN OF FAST MOVING WAVES IN THE OCEAN CAUSED BY POWERFUL EARTHQUAKES IS A VERY SERIOUS CHALLENGE FOR PEOPLE S SAFETY AND FOR EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING. THOSE WAVES CAN INUNDATE COASTAL AREAS DESTROY HOUSES AND EVEN SWIPE AWAY WHOLE TOWNS. THIS IS A DANGER FOR THE WHOLE MANKIND.
UNFORTUNATELY TSUNAMIS CAN NOT BE PREVENTED. HOWEVER THERE ARE WARNING SYSTEMS WHICH MAY WARN THE POPULATION BEFORE THE BIG WAVES REACH THE LAND TO LET THEM ENOUGH TIME TO RUSH TO SAFETY.
SOME PLACES SUCH AS JAPAN OR CALIFORNIA HAVE MANY EARTHQUAKES AND MANY INHABITANTS. THERE IT IS GOOD PRACTICE TO CONSTRUCT HOUSES AND OTHER BUILDINGS WHICH WILL RESIST COLLAPSE IN AN EARTHQUAKE. THIS IS CALLED SEISMIC DESIGN OR EARTHQUAKE PROOFING.
EARTHQUAKE PROOF BUILDINGS ARE CONSTRUCTED TO WITHSTAND THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCE OF AN EARTHQUAKE. THIS DEPENDS UPON ITS TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION SHAPE MASS DISTRIBUTION AND RIGIDITY. DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS ARE USED. SQUARE RECTANGULAR AND SHELL SHAPED BUILDINGS CAN WITHSTAND EARTHQUAKES BETTER THAN SKYSCRAPERS. TO REDUCE STRESS A BUILDING S GROUND FLOOR CAN BE SUPPORTED BY EXTREMELY RIGID HOLLOW COLUMNS WHILE THE REST OF THE BUILDING IS SUPPORTED BY FLEXIBLE COLUMNS INSIDE THE HOLLOW COLUMNS. ANOTHER METHOD IS TO USE ROLLERS OR RUBBER PADS TO SEPARATE THE BASE COLUMNS FROM THE GROUND ALLOWING THE COLUMNS TO SHAKE PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER DURING AN EARTHQUAKE.
TO HELP PREVENT A ROOF FROM COLLAPSING BUILDERS MAKE THE ROOF OUT OF LIGHT WEIGHT MATERIALS. OUTDOOR WALLS ARE MADE WITH STRONGER AND MORE REINFORCED MATERIALS SUCH AS STEEL OR REINFORCED CONCRETE. DURING AN EARTHQUAKE FLEXIBLE WINDOWS MAY HELP HOLD THE WINDOWS TOGETHER SO THEY DON T BREAK.
ECONOMICS
ECONOMICS IS THE BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNED WITH THE PRODUCTION CONSUMPTION AND TRANSFER OF WEALTH 
THE SUBJECTS ACTORS IN ECONOMIC STUDY ARE HOUSEHOLDS BUSINESS COMPANIES THE GOVERNMENT THE STATE AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES. HOUSEHOLDS OFFER THEIR FACTORS OF PRODUCTION TO COMPANIES. THIS INCLUDES WORK LAND CAPITAL MACHINES BUILDINGS AND INFORMATION. THEY GET INCOME WHICH THEY USE TO BUY OR CONSUME GOODS. 
BUSINESS COMPANIES PRODUCE AND SELL GOODS AND SERVICES AND BUY FACTORS OF PRODUCTION FROM HOUSEHOLDS AND FROM OTHER COMPANIES. 
THE STATE OR PUBLIC SECTOR INCLUDES INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANISATIONS. THE STATE TAKES SOME OF THE EARNINGS FROM THE BUSINESS COMPANIES AND HOUSEHOLDS AND USES IT TO PAY FOR PUBLIC GOODS LIKE STREETS OR EDUCATION TO BE AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE. THE LAST SUBJECT IS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THIS INCLUDES ALL HOUSEHOLDS BUSINESS COMPANIES AND STATE INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE NOT BASED IN ONE S OWN COUNTRY. THEY DEMAND AND SUPPLY GOODS FROM ABROAD.
THE OBJECTS THINGS ACTED UPON IN ECONOMIC STUDY ARE CONSUMER GOODS CAPITAL GOODS AND FACTORS OF PRODUCTION. CONSUMER GOODS ARE CLASSIFIED AS USAGE GOODS FOR EXAMPLE GASOLINE OR TOILET PAPER AS PURPOSE GOODS FOR EXAMPLE A HOUSE OR BICYCLE AND AS SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE THE WORK OF A DOCTOR OR CLEANING LADY. CAPITAL GOODS ARE GOODS WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR PRODUCING OTHER GOODS. EXAMPLES OF THESE ARE BUILDINGS EQUIPMENT AND MACHINES. FACTORS OF PRODUCTION ARE WORK GROUND CAPITAL INFORMATION AND ENVIRONMENT.
ECONOMISTS ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE TIMES THEY LIVE IN. FOR EXAMPLE KARL MARX LIVED IN A TIME WHERE WORKERS CONDITIONS WERE VERY POOR AND JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES LIVED THROUGH THE GREAT DEPRESSION OF THE 1930S. TODAY S ECONOMISTS CAN LOOK BACK AND UNDERSTAND WHY THEY MADE THEIR JUDGMENTS AND TRY TO MAKE BETTER ONES.
THE TWO MAIN BRANCHES OF ECONOMICS ARE MICROECONOMICS AND MACROECONOMICS. 
MACROECONOMICS IS ABOUT THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL. FOR EXAMPLE IF A COUNTRY S WEALTH GOES UP OR IF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BECOME UNEMPLOYED THOSE ARE THINGS THAT MACROECONOMISTS STUDY. MICROECONOMICS IS ABOUT SMALLER AND MORE SPECIFIC THINGS SUCH AS HOW FAMILIES AND HOUSEHOLDS SPEND THEIR MONEY OR HOW A BUSINESS OPERATES.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER BRANCHES OF ECONOMICS 
FAMOUS ECONOMISTS IN HISTORY INCLUDE 
FAMOUS ECONOMISTS OF THE 19TH AND 20TH CENTURY INCLUDE FRIEDRICH AUGUST VON HAYEK WASSILY LEONTIEF N. GREGORY MANKIW CARL MENGER AND L ON WALRAS.
ELEVATOR
AN ELEVATOR OR LIFT IS A VERTICAL TRANSPORT VEHICLE THAT EFFICIENTLY MOVES PEOPLE OR GOODS BETWEEN FLOORS OF A BUILDING. THEY ARE GENERALLY POWERED BY ELECTRIC MOTORS THAT EITHER DRIVE TRACTION CABLES AND COUNTERWEIGHT SYSTEMS OR PUMP HYDRAULIC FLUID TO RAISE A CYLINDRICAL PISTON.
LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH MAY HAVE LOANWORDS BASED ON EITHER ELEVATOR E.G. JAPANESE OR LIFT E.G. CANTONESE.
BECAUSE OF WHEELCHAIR ACCESS LAWS ELEVATORS ARE OFTEN A LEGAL REQUIREMENT IN NEW MULTI STORY BUILDINGS ESPECIALLY WHERE WHEELCHAIR RAMPS WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL.
SOME ARGUE THAT LIFTS BEGAN AS SIMPLE ROPE OR CHAIN HOISTS. A LIFT IS ESSENTIALLY A PLATFORM THAT IS EITHER PULLED OR PUSHED UP BY A MECHANICAL MEANS. A MODERN DAY LIFT CONSISTS OF A CAB ALSO CALLED A CAGE OR CAR MOUNTED ON A PLATFORM WITHIN AN ENCLOSED SPACE CALLED A SHAFT OR SOMETIMES A HOISTWAY. IN THE PAST LIFT DRIVE MECHANISMS WERE POWERED BY STEAM AND WATER HYDRAULIC PISTONS. IN A TRACTION LIFT CARS ARE PULLED UP BY MEANS OF ROLLING STEEL ROPES OVER A DEEPLY GROOVED PULLEY COMMONLY CALLED A SHEAVE IN THE INDUSTRY. THE WEIGHT OF THE CAR IS BALANCED WITH A COUNTERWEIGHT. SOMETIMES TWO LIFTS ALWAYS MOVE SYNCHRONOUSLY IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AND THEY ARE EACH OTHER S COUNTERWEIGHT
THE FRICTION BETWEEN THE ROPES AND THE PULLEY FURNISHES THE TRACTION WHICH GIVES THIS TYPE OF LIFT ITS NAME. 
HYDRAULIC LIFTS USE THE PRINCIPLES OF HYDRAULICS IN THE SENSE OF HYDRAULIC POWER TO PRESSURIZE AN ABOVE GROUND OR IN GROUND PISTON TO RAISE AND LOWER THE CAR. ROPED HYDRAULICS USE A COMBINATION OF BOTH ROPES AND HYDRAULIC POWER TO RAISE AND LOWER CARS. RECENT INNOVATIONS INCLUDE PERMANENT EARTH MAGNET MOTORS MACHINE ROOM LESS RAIL MOUNTED GEARLESS MACHINES AND MICROPROCESSOR CONTROLS. 
THE TECHNOLOGY USED IN NEW INSTALLATIONS DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS. HYDRAULIC LIFTS ARE CHEAPER BUT INSTALLING CYLINDERS GREATER THAN A CERTAIN LENGTH BECOMES IMPRACTICAL FOR VERY HIGH LIFT HOISTWAYS. FOR BUILDINGS OF MUCH OVER SEVEN STORIES TRACTION LIFTS MUST BE EMPLOYED INSTEAD. HYDRAULIC LIFTS ARE USUALLY SLOWER THAN TRACTION LIFTS.
LIFTS ARE A CANDIDATE FOR MASS CUSTOMIZATION.
THERE ARE ECONOMIES TO BE MADE FROM MASS PRODUCTION OF THE COMPONENTS BUT EACH BUILDING COMES WITH ITS OWN REQUIREMENTS LIKE DIFFERENT NUMBER OF FLOORS DIMENSIONS OF THE WELL AND USAGE PATTERNS.
ELEVATOR DOORS PROTECT RIDERS FROM FALLING INTO THE SHAFT. THE MOST COMMON CONFIGURATION IS TO HAVE TWO PANELS THAT MEET IN THE MIDDLE AND SLIDE OPEN LATERALLY. IN A CASCADING CONFIGURATION POTENTIALLY ALLOWING WIDER ENTRYWAYS WITHIN LIMITED SPACE THE DOORS RUN ON INDEPENDENT TRACKS SO THAT WHILE OPEN THEY ARE TUCKED BEHIND ONE ANOTHER AND WHILE CLOSED THEY FORM CASCADING LAYERS ON ONE SIDE. THIS CAN CONFIGURED SO THAT TWO SETS OF SUCH CASCADING DOORS OPERATE LIKE THE CENTER OPENING DOORS DESCRIBED ABOVE ALLOWING FOR A VERY WIDE ELEVATOR CAB. IN LESS EXPENSIVE INSTALLATIONS THE ELEVATOR CAN ALSO USE ONE LARGE SLAB DOOR A SINGLE PANEL DOOR THE WIDTH OF THE DOORWAY THAT OPENS TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT LATERALLY.
GENERAL
ALL ELEVATORS WHETHER TRACTION OR HYDRAULIC REQUIRE A MACHINE ROOM TO STORE LARGE ELECTRIC MOTORS OR HYDRAULIC PUMPS AND A CONTROLLER CABINET. THIS ROOM IS LOCATED ABOVE THE HOISTWAY OR BELOW FOR HYDRAULIC ELEVATORS AND MAY CONTAIN MACHINERY FOR A SINGLE OR A GROUP OF ELEVATORS. MODERN DAY TRACTION MOTORS BOASTING GEARLESS AND PERMANENT MAGNET DRIVE CAN BE MORE COMPACT AND EFFICIENT ELECTRONIC MICROPROCESSORS HAVE REPLACED THE MECHANICAL RELAYS. AS A RESULT TRACTION ELEVATORS CAN BE BUILT WITHOUT A DEDICATED ROOM ABOVE THE SHAFT SAVING VALUABLE SPACE IN BUILDING PLANNING.
THE NEW LIFT DESIGN PRESENTS A DEPARTURE FROM THE TRADITIONAL LOOPED OVER THE TOP TRACTION ROPE ROUTING OF TRACTION ELEVATORS. THE ENDS OF THE CABLES ARE FIXED TO THE SUPPORTING STRUCTURE AND THE LENGTH OF THE CABLE ARE CONNECTED TO THE CAR AND COUNTERWEIGHT BY MEANS OF A FORCE MULTIPLYING ENERGY SAVING COMPOUND PULLEY SYSTEM. MACHINE ROOM LESS ELEVATORS HAVE BECOME A WELCOME ALTERNATIVE TO THE OLDER HYDRAULIC ELEVATOR FOR LOW TO MEDIUM RISE BUILDINGS.
KONE A FINNISH ELEVATOR COMPANY FIRST DEVELOPED THE MACHINE ROOM LESS ELEVATOR IN 1996.
BENEFITS FROM A GREEN PERSPECTIVE
THIS TAKES AWAY THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN THAT WAS CREATED BY THE HYDRAULIC CYLINDER BEING STORED UNDERGROUND
OTHER BENEFITS
FACTS
NATIONAL AND LOCAL BUILDING CODES DID NOT ADDRESS ELEVATORS WITHOUT MACHINE ROOMS
THE FIRST REFERENCE TO AN ELEVATOR IS IN THE WORKS OF THE ROMAN ARCHITECT VITRUVIUS WHO REPORTED THAT ARCHIMEDES BUILT HIS FIRST ELEVATOR PROBABLY IN 236 B.C. IN SOME LITERARY SOURCES OF LATER HISTORICAL PERIODS ELEVATORS WERE MENTIONED AS CABS ON A HEMP ROPE AND POWERED BY HAND OR BY ANIMALS. IT IS SUPPOSED THAT ELEVATORS OF THIS TYPE WERE INSTALLED IN THE SINAI MONASTERY OF EGYPT. IN THE 17TH CENTURY THE PROTOTYPES OF ELEVATORS WERE LOCATED IN THE PALACE BUILDINGS OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE.
IN 1852 ELISHA OTIS INTRODUCED THE SAFETY ELEVATOR WHICH PREVENTED THE FALL OF THE CAB IF THE CABLE BROKE. THE DESIGN OF THE OTIS SAFETY ELEVATOR IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO ONE TYPE STILL USED TODAY. A GOVERNOR DEVICE ENGAGES KNURLED ROLLER S LOCKING THE ELEVATOR TO ITS GUIDES SHOULD THE ELEVATOR DESCEND AT EXCESSIVE SPEED. HE DEMONSTRATED IT AT THE NEW YORK EXPOSITION IN THE CRYSTAL PALACE IN 1854.
IN 1874 J.W. MEAKER PATENTED A METHOD WHICH PERMITTED ELEVATOR DOORS TO OPEN AND CLOSE SAFELY.
THE FIRST ELECTRIC ELEVATOR WAS CONSTRUCTED BY THE GERMAN ENGINEER WERNER VON SIEMENS IN 1880.
IN 1882 WHEN HYDRAULIC POWER WAS A WELL ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGY A COMPANY LATER NAMED THE LONDON HYDRAULIC POWER COMPANY WAS FORMED. IT CONSTRUCTED A NETWORK OF HIGH PRESSURE MAINS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE THAMES WHICH ULTIMATELY EXTENDED TO 184 MILES AND POWERED SOME 8 000 MACHINES PREDOMINANTLY LIFTS ELEVATORS AND CRANES.
IN 1929 CLARENCE CONRAD CRISPEN WITH INCLINATOR COMPANY OF AMERICA CREATED THE FIRST RESIDENTIAL ELEVATOR. CRISPEN ALSO INVENTED THE FIRST INCLINED STAIRLIFT.
PNEUMATIC OR VACUUM ELEVATORS OPERATE WITHOUT CABLES AND CAN BE INSTALLED MORE EASILY AND QUICKLY THAN THEIR ALTERNATIVES SINCE THEIR HOUSING COMPRISES PREFABRICATED SECTIONS WHICH ARE CONSIDERABLY NARROWER THAN CONVENTIONAL LIFT SHAFTS. THESE SECTIONS ARE OFTEN TRANSPARENT AND AFFORD THE PASSENGER A NEAR 360 VIEW.
STATISTICALLY SPEAKING ELEVATORS ARE EXTREMELY SAFE. THEIR SAFETY RECORD IS UNSURPASSED BY ANY OTHER VEHICLE SYSTEM. IN 1998 IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY EIGHT 100 MILLIONTHS OF ONE PERCENT 1 IN 12 MILLION OF ELEVATOR RIDES RESULTED IN AN ANOMALY AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE WERE MINOR THINGS SUCH AS THE DOORS FAILING TO OPEN. FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES THERE ARE NO CASES OF ELEVATORS SIMPLY FREE FALLING AND KILLING THE PASSENGERS INSIDE OF THE 20 TO 30 ELEVATOR RELATED DEATHS EACH YEAR MOST OF THEM ARE MAINTENANCE RELATED FOR EXAMPLE TECHNICIANS LEANING TOO FAR INTO THE SHAFT OR GETTING CAUGHT BETWEEN MOVING PARTS AND MOST OF THE REST ARE ATTRIBUTED TO EASILY AVOIDABLE ACCIDENTS SUCH AS PEOPLE STEPPING BLINDLY THROUGH DOORS THAT OPEN INTO EMPTY SHAFTS OR BEING STRANGLED BY SCARVES CAUGHT IN THE DOORS. IN FACT PRIOR TO THE SEPTEMBER 11TH TERRORIST ATTACKS THE ONLY KNOWN FREE FALL INCIDENT IN A MODERN CABLE BORNE ELEVATOR HAPPENED IN 1945 WHEN A B 25 BOMBER STRUCK THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING IN FOG SEVERING THE CABLES OF AN ELEVATOR CAB WHICH FELL FROM THE 75TH FLOOR ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BUILDING SERIOUSLY INJURING THOUGH NOT KILLING THE SOLE OCCUPANT THE FEMALE ELEVATOR OPERATOR. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THOUGH EXTRAORDINARILY UNLIKELY FOR AN ELEVATOR S CABLE TO SNAP ALL ELEVATORS IN THE MODERN ERA HAVE BEEN FITTED WITH SEVERAL SAFETY DEVICES WHICH PREVENT THE ELEVATOR FROM SIMPLY FREE FALLING AND CRASHING. AN ELEVATOR CAB IS TYPICALLY BORNE BY SIX OR EIGHT HOIST CABLES EACH OF WHICH IS CAPABLE ON ITS OWN OF SUPPORTING THE FULL LOAD OF THE ELEVATOR PLUS TWENTY FIVE PER CENT MORE WEIGHT. IN ADDITION THERE IS A DEVICE WHICH DETECTS WHETHER THE ELEVATOR IS DESCENDING FASTER THAN ITS MAXIMUM DESIGNED SPEED IF THIS HAPPENS THE DEVICE CAUSES BRONZE BRAKE SHOES TO CLAMP DOWN ALONG THE VERTICAL RAILS IN THE SHAFT STOPPING THE ELEVATOR QUICKLY BUT NOT SO ABRUPTLY AS TO CAUSE INJURY. IN ADDITION A HYDRAULIC BUFFER IS INSTALLED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT TO CUSHION ANY IMPACT SOMEWHAT.
MOST RECENTLY THERE WAS AN INCIDENT IN A MODERN CABLE BORNE ELEVATOR THAT TOOK PLACE IN A CHILDREN S HOSPITAL IN SEATTLE WASHINGTON ON OCTOBER 9 2007. THE ELEVATOR INVOLVED WAS A THYSSENKRUPP ISIS MACHINE ROOM LESS ELEVATOR THE ISIS USED KEVLAR FIBERGLASS ROPES INSTEAD OF CONVENTIONAL BRAIDED STEEL ROPES ALL OTHER TRACTION ELEVATORS USE. ONE OF THE ISIS ELEVATORS BROKE FREE FROM ITS CABLES SLIPPING BETWEEN THE 6TH AND 4TH FLOORS THE KEVLAR ROPES WERE THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT. AFTER THE INCIDENT THYSSENKRUPP DISCONTINUED PRODUCTION OF THE ISIS AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR REPLACED IT WITH THE SYNERGY MACHINE ROOM LESS ELEVATOR WHICH USES CONVENTIONAL BRAIDED STEEL ROPES MAKING IT MUCH SAFER.
PAST PROBLEMS WITH EARLY HYDRAULIC ELEVATORS MEANT THOSE BUILT PRIOR TO A CODE CHANGE IN 1972 WERE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE CATASTROPHIC FAILURE. THE CODE HAD PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED ONLY SINGLE BOTTOM HYDRAULIC CYLINDERS. IN THE EVENT OF A CYLINDER BREACH AN UNCONTROLLED FALL OF THE ELEVATOR MIGHT RESULT. BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY THE SYSTEM COMPLETELY WITHOUT A PRESSURIZED CASING AS DESCRIBED BELOW IT IS NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE PISTON TO INSPECT IT. THE COST OF REMOVING THE PISTON IS SUCH THAT IT MAKES NO ECONOMIC SENSE TO RE INSTALL THE OLD CYLINDER THEREFORE IT IS NECESSARY TO REPLACE THE CYLINDER AND INSTALL A NEW PISTON. ANOTHER SOLUTION TO PROTECT AGAINST A CYLINDER BLOWOUT IS TO INSTALL A LIFE JACKET. THIS IS A DEVICE WHICH IN THE EVENT OF AN EXCESSIVE DOWNWARD SPEED CLAMPS ONTO THE CYLINDER AND STOPS THE CAR. THIS DEVICE IS ALSO KNOWN AS A RUPTURE VALVE IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD.
IN ADDITION TO THE SAFETY CONCERNS FOR OLDER HYDRAULIC ELEVATORS THERE IS RISK OF LEAKING HYDRAULIC OIL INTO THE AQUIFER AND CAUSING POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION. THIS HAS LED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF PVC LINERS CASINGS AROUND HYDRAULIC CYLINDERS WHICH CAN BE MONITORED FOR INTEGRITY.
IN THE PAST DECADE RECENT INNOVATIONS IN INVERTED HYDRAULIC JACKS HAVE ELIMINATED THE COSTLY PROCESS OF DRILLING THE GROUND TO INSTALL A BOREHOLE JACK. THIS ALSO ELIMINATES THE THREAT OF CORROSION TO THE SYSTEM AND INCREASES SAFETY.
THERE ARE AT LEAST FOUR MEANS OF MOVING AN ELEVATOR 
GEARED TRACTION MACHINES ARE DRIVEN BY AC OR DC ELECTRIC MOTORS. GEARED MACHINES USE WORM GEARS TO CONTROL MECHANICAL MOVEMENT OF ELEVATOR CARS BY ROLLING STEEL HOIST ROPES OVER A DRIVE SHEAVE WHICH IS ATTACHED TO A GEARBOX DRIVEN BY A HIGH SPEED MOTOR. THESE MACHINES ARE GENERALLY THE BEST OPTION FOR BASEMENT OR OVERHEAD TRACTION USE FOR SPEEDS UP TO 500 FT MIN 2.5 M S.
GEARLESS TRACTION MACHINES ARE LOW SPEED LOW RPM HIGH TORQUE ELECTRIC MOTORS POWERED EITHER BY AC OR DC. IN THIS CASE THE DRIVE SHEAVE IS DIRECTLY ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE MOTOR. GEARLESS TRACTION ELEVATORS CAN REACH SPEEDS OF UP TO 2 000 FT MIN 10 M S OR EVEN HIGHER. A BRAKE IS MOUNTED BETWEEN THE MOTOR AND DRIVE SHEAVE OR GEARBOX TO HOLD THE ELEVATOR STATIONARY AT A FLOOR. THIS BRAKE IS USUALLY AN EXTERNAL DRUM TYPE AND IS ACTUATED BY SPRING FORCE AND HELD OPEN ELECTRICALLY A POWER FAILURE WILL CAUSE THE BRAKE TO ENGAGE AND PREVENT THE ELEVATOR FROM FALLING SEE INHERENT SAFETY AND SAFETY ENGINEERING.
IN EACH CASE CABLES ARE ATTACHED TO A HITCH PLATE ON TOP OF THE CAB OR MAY BE UNDERSLUNG BELOW A CAB AND THEN LOOPED OVER THE DRIVE SHEAVE TO A COUNTERWEIGHT ATTACHED TO THE OPPOSITE END OF THE CABLES WHICH REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF POWER NEEDED TO MOVE THE CAB. THE COUNTERWEIGHT IS LOCATED IN THE HOIST WAY AND RIDES A SEPARATE RAIL SYSTEM AS THE CAR GOES UP THE COUNTERWEIGHT GOES DOWN AND VICE VERSA. THIS ACTION IS POWERED BY THE TRACTION MACHINE WHICH IS DIRECTED BY THE CONTROLLER TYPICALLY A RELAY LOGIC OR COMPUTERIZED DEVICE THAT DIRECTS STARTING ACCELERATION DECELERATION AND STOPPING OF THE ELEVATOR CAB. THE WEIGHT OF THE COUNTERWEIGHT IS TYPICALLY EQUAL TO THE WEIGHT OF THE ELEVATOR CAB PLUS 40 50 OF THE CAPACITY OF THE ELEVATOR. THE GROOVES IN THE DRIVE SHEAVE ARE SPECIALLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE CABLES FROM SLIPPING. TRACTION IS PROVIDED TO THE ROPES BY THE GRIP OF THE GROOVES IN THE SHEAVE THEREBY THE NAME. AS THE ROPES AGE AND THE TRACTION GROOVES WEAR SOME TRACTION IS LOST AND THE ROPES MUST BE REPLACED AND THE SHEAVE REPAIRED OR REPLACED. 
ELEVATORS WITH MORE THAN 100 30 M OF TRAVEL HAVE A SYSTEM CALLED COMPENSATION. THIS IS A SEPARATE SET OF CABLES OR A CHAIN ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE COUNTERWEIGHT AND THE BOTTOM OF THE ELEVATOR CAB. THIS MAKES IT EASIER TO CONTROL THE ELEVATOR AS IT COMPENSATES FOR THE DIFFERING WEIGHT OF CABLE BETWEEN THE HOIST AND THE CAB. IF THE ELEVATOR CAB IS AT THE TOP OF THE HOIST WAY THERE IS A SHORT LENGTH OF HOIST CABLE ABOVE THE CAR AND A LONG LENGTH OF COMPENSATING CABLE BELOW THE CAR AND VICE VERSA FOR THE COUNTERWEIGHT. IF THE COMPENSATION SYSTEM USES CABLES THERE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL SHEAVE IN THE PIT BELOW THE ELEVATOR TO GUIDE THE CABLES. IF THE COMPENSATION SYSTEM USES CHAINS THE CHAIN IS GUIDED BY A BAR MOUNTED BETWEEN THE COUNTERWEIGHT RAILS.
A CLIMBING ELEVATOR IS A SELF ASCENDING ELEVATOR WITH ITS OWN PROPULSION. THE PROPULSION CAN BE DONE BY AN ELECTRIC OR A COMBUSTION ENGINE. CLIMBING ELEVATORS ARE USED IN GUYED MASTS OR TOWERS IN ORDER TO MAKE EASY ACCESS TO PARTS OF THESE CONSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS FLIGHT SAFETY LAMPS FOR MAINTENANCE. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE MOONLIGHT TOWERS IN AUSTIN TEXAS WHERE THE ELEVATOR HOLDS ONLY ONE PERSON AND EQUIPMENT FOR MAINTENANCE.
MANY ELEVATOR INSTALLATIONS NOW FEATURE EMERGENCY POWER SYSTEMS WHICH ALLOW ELEVATOR USE IN BLACKOUT SITUATIONS AND PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BECOMING TRAPPED IN ELEVATORS.
WHEN POWER IS LOST IN A TRACTION ELEVATOR SYSTEM ALL ELEVATORS WILL INITIALLY COME TO A HALT. ONE BY ONE EACH CAR IN THE GROUP WILL RETURN TO THE LOBBY FLOOR OPEN ITS DOORS AND SHUT DOWN. PEOPLE IN THE REMAINING ELEVATORS MAY SEE AN INDICATOR LIGHT OR HEAR A VOICE ANNOUNCEMENT INFORMING THEM THAT THE ELEVATOR WILL RETURN TO THE LOBBY SHORTLY. ONCE ALL CARS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RETURNED THE SYSTEM WILL THEN AUTOMATICALLY SELECT ONE OR MORE CARS TO BE USED FOR NORMAL OPERATIONS AND THESE CARS WILL RETURN TO SERVICE. THE CAR S SELECTED TO RUN UNDER EMERGENCY POWER CAN BE MANUALLY OVERRIDDEN BY A KEY OR STRIP SWITCH IN THE LOBBY. IN ORDER TO HELP PREVENT ENTRAPMENT WHEN THE SYSTEM DETECTS THAT IT IS RUNNING LOW ON POWER IT WILL BRING THE RUNNING CARS TO THE LOBBY OR NEAREST FLOOR OPEN THE DOORS AND SHUT DOWN.
IN HYDRAULIC ELEVATOR SYSTEMS EMERGENCY POWER WILL LOWER THE ELEVATORS TO THE LOWEST LANDING AND OPEN THE DOORS TO ALLOW PASSENGERS TO EXIT. THE DOORS THEN CLOSE AFTER AN ADJUSTABLE TIME PERIOD AND THE CAR REMAINS UNUSABLE UNTIL RESET USUALLY BY CYCLING THE ELEVATOR MAIN POWER SWITCH. TYPICALLY DUE TO THE HIGH CURRENT DRAW WHEN STARTING THE PUMP MOTOR HYDRAULIC ELEVATORS ARE NOT RUN USING STANDARD EMERGENCY POWER SYSTEMS. BUILDINGS LIKE HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES USUALLY SIZE THEIR EMERGENCY GENERATORS TO ACCOMMODATE THIS DRAW. HOWEVER THE INCREASING USE OF CURRENT LIMITING MOTOR STARTERS COMMONLY KNOWN AS SOFT START CONTACTORS AVOID MUCH OF THIS PROBLEM AND THE CURRENT DRAW OF THE PUMP MOTOR IS LESS OF A LIMITING CONCERN.
ELEVATORS MAY FEATURE TALKING DEVICES AS AN ACCESSIBILITY AID FOR THE BLIND. IN ADDITION TO FLOOR ARRIVAL NOTIFICATIONS THE COMPUTER ANNOUNCES THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL AND NOTIFIES THE PASSENGERS BEFORE THE DOORS ARE TO CLOSE.
IN ADDITION TO THE CALL BUTTONS ELEVATORS USUALLY HAVE FLOOR INDICATORS OFTEN ILLUMINATED BY LED AND DIRECTION LANTERNS. THE FORMER ARE ALMOST UNIVERSAL IN CAB INTERIORS WITH MORE THAN TWO STOPS AND MAY BE FOUND OUTSIDE THE ELEVATORS AS WELL ON ONE OR MORE OF THE FLOORS. FLOOR INDICATORS CAN CONSIST OF A DIAL WITH A ROTATING NEEDLE BUT THE MOST COMMON TYPES ARE THOSE WITH SUCCESSIVELY ILLUMINATED FLOOR INDICATIONS OR LCDS. LIKEWISE A CHANGE OF FLOORS OR AN ARRIVAL AT A FLOOR IS INDICATED BY A SOUND DEPENDING ON THE ELEVATOR.
DIRECTION LANTERNS ARE ALSO FOUND BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE ELEVATOR CARS BUT THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE VISIBLE FROM OUTSIDE BECAUSE THEIR PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO HELP PEOPLE DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO GET ON THE ELEVATOR. IF SOMEBODY WAITING FOR THE ELEVATOR WANTS TO GO UP BUT A CAR COMES FIRST THAT INDICATES THAT IT IS GOING DOWN THEN THE PERSON MAY DECIDE NOT TO GET ON THE ELEVATOR. IF THE PERSON WAITS THEN ONE WILL STILL STOP GOING UP. DIRECTION INDICATORS ARE SOMETIMES ETCHED WITH ARROWS OR SHAPED LIKE ARROWS AND OR USE THE CONVENTION THAT ONE THAT LIGHTS UP RED MEANS DOWN AND GREEN MEANS UP. SINCE THE COLOR CONVENTION IS OFTEN UNDERMINED OR OVERRIDED BY SYSTEMS THAT DO NOT INVOKE IT IT IS USUALLY USED ONLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER DIFFERENTIATING FACTORS. AN EXAMPLE OF A PLACE WHOSE ELEVATORS USE ONLY THE COLOR CONVENTION TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN DIRECTIONS IS THE MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART IN CHICAGO WHERE A SINGLE CIRCLE CAN BE MADE TO LIGHT UP GREEN FOR UP AND RED FOR DOWN. SOMETIMES DIRECTIONS MUST BE INFERRED BY THE POSITION OF THE INDICATORS RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER.
IN ADDITION TO LANTERNS MOST ELEVATORS HAVE A CHIME TO INDICATE IF THE ELEVATOR IS GOING UP OR DOWN EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE DOORS OPEN USUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LANTERNS LIGHTING UP. UNIVERSALLY ONE CHIME IS FOR UP TWO IS FOR DOWN AND NONE INDICATES AN ELEVATOR THAT IS FREE.
OBSERVATORY SERVICE ELEVATORS OFTEN CONVEY OTHER FACTS OF INTEREST INCLUDING ELEVATOR SPEED STOPWATCH AND CURRENT POSITION ALTITUDE AS WITH THE CASE FOR TAIPEI 101 S SERVICE ELEVATORS.
THE MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL DESIGN OF ELEVATORS IS DICTATED ACCORDING TO VARIOUS STANDARDS AKA ELEVATOR CODES WHICH MAY BE INTERNATIONAL NATIONAL STATE REGIONAL OR CITY BASED. WHEREAS ONCE MANY STANDARDS WERE PRESCRIPTIVE SPECIFYING EXACT CRITERIA WHICH MUST BE COMPLIED WITH THERE HAS RECENTLY BEEN A SHIFT TOWARDS MORE PERFORMANCE BASED STANDARDS WHERE THE ONUS FALLS ON THE DESIGNER TO ENSURE THAT THE ELEVATOR MEETS OR EXCEEDS THE STANDARD.
SOME OF THE NATIONAL ELEVATOR STANDARDS INCLUDE 
BECAUSE AN ELEVATOR IS PART OF A BUILDING IT MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH STANDARDS RELATING TO EARTHQUAKE RESILIENCE FIRE STANDARDS ELECTRICAL WIRING RULES AND SO FORTH.
THE AMERICAN NATIONAL ELEVATOR STANDARDS GROUP ANESG SETS AN ELEVATOR WEIGHT STANDARD TO BE 2200 LBS.
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO ACCESS BY DISABLED PERSONS MAY BE MANDATED BY LAWS OR REGULATIONS SUCH AS THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT.
ENZYME
ENZYMES ARE PROTEIN MOLECULES IN CELLS WHICH WORK AS CATALYSTS. ENZYMES SPEED UP CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN THE BODY BUT DO NOT GET USED UP IN THE PROCESS.
ALMOST ALL BIOCHEMICAL REACTIONS IN LIVING THINGS NEED ENZYMES. WITH AN ENZYME CHEMICAL REACTIONS GO MUCH FASTER THAN THEY WOULD WITHOUT THE ENZYME.
THE SUBSTANCES AT THE START OF THE REACTION ARE CALLED SUBSTRATES. THE SUBSTANCES AT THE END OF THE REACTION ARE THE PRODUCTS. ENZYMES WORK ON THE SUBSTRATES AND TURN THEM INTO PRODUCTS.
THE FIRST ENZYME WAS FOUND IN 1833 BY ANSELME PAYEN.
ENZYMES ARE LARGE MOLECULES MADE FROM MANY AMINO ACIDS. THE AMINO ACIDS LINK TOGETHER IN A LONG CHAIN WHICH IS FOLDED UP INTO A COMPLEX STRUCTURE. ENZYMES HAVE A PART WHICH HOLDS THE SUBSTRATE A CLAW CLEFT HOLLOW OR KNOB TO GRASP HOLD STRETCH AND BEND THE MOLECULE IT ACTS ON THE SUBSTRATE.
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT ENZYMES. ENZYMES HAVE NAMES WHICH SHOW WHAT THEY DO. ENZYME NAMES USUALLY END IN ASE TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE ENZYMES. EXAMPLES OF THIS INCLUDE ATP SYNTHASE. IT MAKES A CHEMICAL CALLED ATP. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS DNA POLYMERASE. IT READS AN INTACT DNA STRAND AND USES IT AS A TEMPLATE TO MAKE A NEW STRAND.
ONE EXAMPLE OF AN ENZYME IS AMYLASE FOUND IN SALIVA. IT BREAKS DOWN STARCH MOLECULES INTO SMALLER GLUCOSE AND MALTOSE MOLECULES. ANOTHER KIND OF ENZYME IS LIPASE. IT BREAKS DOWN FATS INTO SMALLER MOLECULES.
THE PROTEASES ARE A WHOLE CLASS OF ENZYMES. THEY BREAK DOWN OTHER ENZYMES AND PROTEINS BACK INTO AMINO ACIDS. NUCLEASES ARE ENZYMES THAT CUT DNA OR RNA OFTEN IN SPECIFIC PLACE IN THE MOLECULE.
ENZYMES ARE NOT ONLY FOR BREAKING LARGE CHEMICALS INTO SMALLER CHEMICALS. OTHER ENZYMES TAKE SMALLER CHEMICALS AND BUILD THEM UP INTO BIGGER CHEMICALS AND DO MANY OTHER CHEMICAL TASKS. THE CLASSIFICATION BELOW LISTS THE MAIN TYPES.
BIOCHEMISTS OFTEN DRAW A PICTURE OF AN ENZYME TO USE AS A VISUAL AID OR MAP OF THE ENZYME. THIS IS HARD TO DO BECAUSE THERE MAY BE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF ATOMS IN AN ENZYME. BIOCHEMISTS CAN NOT DRAW ALL THIS DETAIL. INSTEAD THEY USE RIBBON MODELS AS PICTURES OF ENZYMES. RIBBON MODELS CAN SHOW THE SHAPE OF AN ENZYME WITHOUT HAVING TO DRAW EVERY ATOM.
MOST ENZYMES WILL NOT WORK UNLESS THE TEMPERATURE AND PH ARE JUST RIGHT. IN MAMMALS THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE IS USUALLY ABOUT 37C DEGREES BODY TEMPERATURE. THE CORRECT PH CAN VARY GREATLY. PEPSIN IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN ENZYME THAT WORKS BEST WHEN PH IS ABOUT 1.5.
HEATING AN ENZYME ABOVE A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE WILL DESTROY THE ENZYME PERMANENTLY. IT WILL BE BROKEN DOWN BY PROTEASE AND THE CHEMICALS WILL BE USED AGAIN.
SOME CHEMICALS CAN HELP AN ENZYME DO ITS JOB EVEN BETTER. THESE ARE CALLED ACTIVATORS. SOMETIMES A CHEMICAL CAN SLOW DOWN AN ENZYME OR EVEN MAKE THE ENZYME NOT WORK AT ALL. THESE ARE CALLED INHIBITORS. MOST DRUGS ARE CHEMICALS THAT EITHER SPEED UP OR SLOW DOWN SOME ENZYME IN THE HUMAN BODY.
ENZYMES ARE VERY SPECIFIC. IN 1894 EMIL FISCHER SUGGESTED THAT BOTH THE ENZYME AND THE SUBSTRATE HAVE SPECIFIC COMPLEMENTARY GEOMETRIC SHAPES THAT FIT EXACTLY INTO ONE ANOTHER. THIS IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE LOCK AND KEY MODEL. HOWEVER THIS MODEL FAILS TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
IN 1958 DANIEL KOSHLAND SUGGESTED A MODIFICATION TO THE LOCK AND KEY MODEL. SINCE ENZYMES ARE RATHER FLEXIBLE STRUCTURES THE ACTIVE SITE IS RESHAPED BY INTERACTIONS WITH THE SUBSTRATE. AS A RESULT THE SUBSTRATE DOES NOT SIMPLY BIND TO A RIGID ACTIVE SITE. THE AMINO ACID SIDE CHAINS OF THE ACTIVE SITE ARE BENT INTO POSITIONS SO THE ENZYME DOES ITS CATALYTIC WORK. IN SOME CASES SUCH AS GLYCOSIDASES THE SUBSTRATE MOLECULE ALSO CHANGES SHAPE SLIGHTLY AS IT ENTERS THE ACTIVE SITE.
THE GENERAL EQUATION FOR AN ENZYME REACTION IS 
ENZYMES LOWER THE ACTIVATION ENERGY OF A REACTION BY FORMING AN INTERMEDIARY COMPLEX WITH THE SUBSTRATE. THIS COMPLEX IS CALLED AN ENZYME SUBSTRATE COMPLEX.
FOR EXAMPLE SUCRASE 400 TIMES THE SIZE OF ITS SUBSTRATE SUCROSE SPLITS THE SUCROSE INTO ITS CONSTITUENT SUGARS WHICH ARE GLUCOSE AND FRUCTOSE. THE SUCRASE BENDS THE SUCROSE AND STRAINS THE BOND BETWEEN THE GLUCOSE AND FRUCTOSE. WATER MOLECULES JOIN IN AND MAKE THE CLEAVAGE IN A FRACTION OF A SECOND. ENZYMES HAVE THESE KEY FEATURES 
THERE ARE FIVE MAIN WAYS THAT ENZYME ACTIVITY IS CONTROLLED IN THE CELL.
COFACTORS OR COENZYMES ARE HELPER MOLECULES WHICH ARE NEEDED TO MAKE AN ENZYME WORK. THEY ARE NOT PROTEINS AND MAY BE ORGANIC OR INORGANIC MOLECULES. BOTH TYPES OF MOLECULES SOMETIMES CONTAIN A METAL ION AT THE CENTRE SUCH AS MG CU MN OR IRON SULPHUR CLUSTERS. THIS IS BECAUSE SUCH IONS MAY ACT AS ELECTRON DONORS AND THIS IS IMPORTANT IN MANY REACTIONS. THE NEED OF ENZYMES FOR VARIOUS LITTLE HELPERS IS THE BASIC REASON WHY ANIMALS INCLUDING OURSELVES NEED TRACE ELEMENTS AND VITAMINS.
ENZYMES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED BY THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF BIOCHEMISTRY. THEIR COMMISSION ON ENZYMES HAS GROUPED ALL KNOWN ENZYMES INTO SIX CLASSES 
THE INDIVIDUAL ENZYMES ARE GIVEN A FOUR FIGURE NUMBER WHICH CLASSIFIES THEM IN THE DATABASE.
ESPERANTO
ESPERANTO IS A CONSTRUCTED AUXILIARY LANGUAGE. ITS CREATOR WAS LUDOVIC LAZARUS ZAMENHOF A POLISH EYE DOCTOR. HE CREATED THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION EASIER. HIS GOAL WAS TO DESIGN ESPERANTO IN SUCH A WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN LEARN IT MUCH MORE EASILY THAN ANY OTHER NATIONAL LANGUAGE.
AT FIRST ZAMENHOF CALLED THE LANGUAGE WHICH MEANS THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE IN ESPERANTO. SOON PEOPLE BEGAN CALLING IT BY THE SIMPLER NAME WHICH MEANS A HOPEFUL PERSON. THAT NAME COMES FROM DOCTOR HOPEFUL WHICH IS WHAT ZAMENHOF CALLED HIMSELF IN HIS FIRST BOOK ABOUT ESPERANTO.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SPEAK ESPERANTO IN MANY COUNTRIES AND IN ALL THE MAJOR CONTINENTS. NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE NOW SPEAK ESPERANTO IN THE WORLD. MOST SOURCES SAY THAT THERE ARE BETWEEN SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND AND TWO MILLION ESPERANTO SPEAKERS. A FEW PEOPLE GREW UP SPEAKING ESPERANTO AS THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE. THERE MAY PERHAPS BE AROUND 2 000 OF THESE PEOPLE. THEREFORE ESPERANTO IS THE MOST USED CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE IN THE WORLD.
A PERSON WHO SPEAKS OR SUPPORTS ESPERANTO IS OFTEN CALLED AN ESPERANTIST.
LUDOVIC LAZARUS ZAMENHOF CREATED ESPERANTO. HE GREW UP IN BIA YSTOK A TOWN THAT WAS IN THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE BUT IS NOW IN POLAND. PEOPLE IN BIA YSTOK SPOKE MANY LANGUAGES. ZAMENHOF SAW CONFLICTS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL ETHNIC GROUPS LIVING THERE RUSSIANS POLES GERMANS AND JEWS. HE THOUGHT THAT LACK OF A COMMON LANGUAGE CAUSED THESE CONFLICTS SO HE BEGAN CREATING A LANGUAGE PEOPLE COULD SHARE AND USE INTERNATIONALLY. HE THOUGHT THIS LANGUAGE SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM NATIONAL LANGUAGES. HE WANTED IT TO BE CULTURALLY NEUTRAL AND EASY TO LEARN. HE THOUGHT PEOPLE SHOULD LEARN IT ALONG WITH NATIONAL LANGUAGES AND USE ESPERANTO FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT NATIVE LANGUAGES.
FIRST ZAMENHOF THOUGHT ABOUT BRINGING LATIN BACK INTO USE. HE LEARNED IT IN SCHOOL BUT HE REALIZED IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT FOR NORMAL USE. HE ALSO STUDIED ENGLISH AND UNDERSTOOD THAT LANGUAGES DID NOT NEED TO CONJUGATE VERBS BY PERSON OR NUMBER. ONCE HE SAW TWO RUSSIAN WORDS RECEPTION DERIVED FROM RECEPTIONIST AND CONFECTIONERY DERIVED FROM CONFECTIONER. THESE WORDS WITH THE SAME ENDING GAVE HIM AN IDEA. HE DECIDED THAT REGULAR PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES COULD DECREASE THE NUMBER OF WORD ROOTS WHICH ONE WOULD NEED FOR A COMMUNICATION. ZAMENHOF WANTED THE ROOT WORDS TO BE NEUTRAL SO HE DECIDED TO USE WORD ROOTS FROM ROMANCE AND GERMANIC LANGUAGES. THOSE LANGUAGES WERE TAUGHT IN MANY SCHOOLS IN MANY PLACES AROUND THE WORLD AT THAT TIME.
ZAMENHOF DID HIS FIRST PROJECT LINGWE UNIWERSALA UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE IN 1878 BUT HIS FATHER A LANGUAGE TEACHER REGARDED HIS SON S WORK AS UNREALISTIC AND HE DESTROYED THE ORIGINAL WORK. BETWEEN 1879 AND 1885 ZAMENHOF STUDIED MEDICINE IN MOSCOW AND WARSAW. IN THESE DAYS HE AGAIN WORKED ON AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE. IN 1887 HE PUBLISHED HIS FIRST TEXTBOOK THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE. ACCORDING TO ZAMENHOF S PSEUDONYM DOCTOR WHO HOPES MANY PEOPLE STARTED CALLING THE LANGUAGE AS ESPERANTO.
ZAMENHOF RECEIVED A LOT OF ENTHUSIASTIC LETTERS. IN THE LETTERS PEOPLE WROTE THEIR SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGES TO THE LANGUAGE. HE NOTED ALL OF THE SUGGESTIONS. HE PUBLISHED THEM IN THE MAGAZINE LA ESPERANTISTO. IN THIS MAGAZINE ESPERANTO SPEAKERS COULD VOTE ABOUT THE CHANGES. THEY DIDN T ACCEPT THEM. THE MAGAZINE HAD MANY SUBSCRIBERS IN RUSSIA. IT WAS EVENTUALLY BANNED STOPPED THERE BECAUSE OF AN ARTICLE ABOUT LEV NIKOLAYEVICH TOLSTOY. PUBLISHING OF THE MAGAZINE ENDED AFTER THAT. THE NEW MAGAZINE LINGVO INTERNACIA REPLACED IT.
IN THE FIRST YEARS OF ESPERANTO S LIFE PEOPLE USED IT ONLY IN WRITTEN FORM BUT IN 1905 THEY ORGANIZED THE FIRST 1ST WORLD CONGRESS OF ESPERANTO IN BOULOGNE SUR MER FRANCE. THIS WAS THE FIRST NOTABLE USE OF ESPERANTO IN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION. BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE CONGRESS IT IS ORGANIZED EACH YEAR EXCEPT YEARS OF THE WORLD WARS TO THIS DAY.
IN 1912 ZAMENHOF RESIGNED HIS LEADING POSITION IN THE MOVEMENT DURING THE EIGHTH 8TH WORLD CONGRESS OF ESPERANTO IN KRAK W POLAND. THE TENTH 10TH WORLD CONGRESS OF ESPERANTO IN PARIS FRANCE DIDN T TAKE PLACE BECAUSE OF THE START OF WORLD WAR I. NEARLY 4000 PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR THIS CONGRESS.
DURING WORLD WAR I THE WORLD ESPERANTO ASSOCIATION HAD ITS MAIN OFFICE IN SWITZERLAND WHICH WAS NEUTRAL IN THE WAR. HECTOR HODLER S GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS WITH SUPPORT OF ROMAIN ROLLAND HELPED SEND LETTERS BETWEEN THE ENEMY COUNTRIES THROUGH SWITZERLAND. IN TOTAL THEY HELPED WITH 200 000 CASES.
AFTER WORLD WAR I THERE WAS NEW HOPE FOR ESPERANTO BECAUSE OF THE DESIRE OF PEOPLE TO LIVE IN PEACE. ESPERANTO AND ITS COMMUNITY GREW IN THOSE DAYS. THE FIRST WORLD CONGRESS AFTER THE WAR TOOK PLACE IN HAGUE NETHERLANDS IN 1920. AN ESPERANTO MUSEUM WAS OPENED IN VIENNA AUSTRIA IN 1929. TODAY IT IS PART OF THE AUSTRIAN NATIONAL LIBRARY.
WORLD WAR II STOPPED THIS GROWING OF THE LANGUAGE. MANY ESPERANTISTS WERE SENT INTO THE BATTLE. NAZIS BROKE UP ESPERANTO GROUPS BECAUSE THEY SAW THE LANGUAGE AS A PART OF A WORLDWIDE JEWISH CONSPIRACY. MANY ESPERANTO SPEAKERS DIED IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS. THE SOVIET UNION ALSO TREATED ESPERANTISTS BADLY WHEN STALIN WAS THEIR LEADER.
AFTER WORLD WAR II MANY PEOPLE SUPPORTED ESPERANTO. 80 MILLION PEOPLE SIGNED A PETITION SUPPORTING ESPERANTO FOR USE IN THE UNITED NATIONS.
EVERY YEAR THEY ORGANIZE BIG ESPERANTO MEETINGS SUCH AS THE WORLD CONGRESS OF ESPERANTO INTERNATIONAL YOUTH CONGRESS OF ESPERANTO AND SAT CONGRESS MEETING OF SENNACIECA ASOCIO TUTMONDA WORLD NON NATIONAL ASSOCIATION.
IN 1990 THE HOLY SEE PUBLISHED THE DOCUMENT NORME PER LA CELEBRAZIONE DELLA MESSA IN ESPERANTO ALLOWING THE USE OF ESPERANTO IN MASSES WITHOUT SPECIAL PERMISSION. ESPERANTO IS THE ONLY CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE WHICH RECEIVED A PERMISSION LIKE THIS ONE FROM THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.
ESPERANTO HAS MANY WEB PAGES BLOGS PODCASTS AND VIDEOS. PEOPLE ALSO USE ESPERANTO IN SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE DISCUSSIONS AND IN THEIR PRIVATE COMMUNICATION THROUGH E MAIL AND INSTANT MESSAGING. SEVERAL ESPECIALLY OPEN SOURCE AND FREE SOFTWARE PROGRAMMES HAVE THEIR OWN LANGUAGE VERSION IN ESPERANTO. INTERNET RADIO STATION MUZAIKO HAS BEEN BROADCASTING 24 HOURS A DAY IN ESPERANTO SINCE 2011.
ZAMENHOF WANTED TO MAKE AN EASY LANGUAGE TO INCREASE INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING. HE WANTED ESPERANTO TO BE A UNIVERSAL SECOND LANGUAGE. IN OTHER WORDS ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT WANT ESPERANTO TO REPLACE NATIONAL LANGUAGES HE WANTED A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD TO SPEAK ESPERANTO. MANY ESPERANTISTS INITIALLY SHARED THIS GOAL. GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF UNESCO RECOGNIZED ESPERANTO IN 1954. SINCE THEN WORLD ESPERANTO ASSOCIATION HAS GOT OFFICIAL RELATIONS WITH UNESCO. HOWEVER ESPERANTO WAS NEVER CHOSEN BY THE UNITED NATIONS OR OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND IT HAS NOT BECOME A WIDELY ACCEPTED SECOND LANGUAGE.
SOME ESPERANTO SPEAKERS LIKE ESPERANTO FOR REASONS OTHER THAN ITS USE AS A UNIVERSAL SECOND LANGUAGE. THEY LIKE THE ESPERANTO COMMUNITY AND CULTURE. DEVELOPING THE ESPERANTO CULTURE IS A GOAL FOR THAT PEOPLE.
PEOPLE WHO CARE MORE ABOUT ESPERANTO S CURRENT VALUE THAN ABOUT ITS POTENTIAL FOR UNIVERSAL USE ARE SOMETIMES CALLED RA MISTOJ IN ESPERANTO. THE IDEAS OF THESE PEOPLE CAN TOGETHER BE CALLED OR RAUMISM IN ENGLISH. THE NAMES COME FROM THE NAME OF THE TOWN OF RAUMA IN FINLAND. THE INTERNATIONAL YOUTH CONGRESS OF ESPERANTO MET THERE IN 1980 AND MADE A BIG STATEMENT. THEY SAID THAT MAKING ESPERANTO A UNIVERSAL SECOND LANGUAGE WAS NOT THEIR MAIN GOAL.
PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOALS FOR ESPERANTO THAT ARE MORE SIMILAR TO ZAMENHOF S ARE SOMETIMES CALLED IN ESPERANTO. THE NAME COMES FROM AN ESPERANTO PHRASE WHICH MEANS FINAL VICTORY. IT REFERS TO A THEORETICAL FUTURE IN WHICH NEARLY EVERYONE ON EARTH SPEAKS ESPERANTO AS A SECOND LANGUAGE.
THE PRAGUE MANIFESTO 1996 STATES THE IDEAS OF THE ORDINARY PEOPLE OF THE ESPERANTO MOVEMENT AND OF ITS MAIN ORGANIZATION THE WORLD ESPERANTO ASSOCIATION UEA.
GERMAN TOWN HERZBERG AM HARZ USES NICKNAME DIE ESPERANTO STADT LA ESPERANTO URBO THE ESPERANTO TOWN SINCE 12 JULY 2006. THEY ALSO TEACH THE LANGUAGE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND DO SOME OTHER CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL EVENTS USING THE ESPERANTO LANGUAGE TOGETHER WITH THE POLISH TWIN TOWN G RA.
ESPERANTO IS THE ONLY CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE THAT THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH RECOGNISES AS A LITURGICAL LANGUAGE. THEY ALLOW MASSES IN THE LANGUAGE AND VATICAN RADIO BROADCASTS IN ESPERANTO EVERY WEEK.
MANY PEOPLE USE ESPERANTO TO COMMUNICATE BY MAIL EMAIL BLOGS OR CHAT ROOMS WITH ESPERANTISTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. SOME TRAVEL TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO MEET AND TALK IN ESPERANTO WITH OTHER ESPERANTISTS.
THERE ARE ANNUAL MEETINGS OF ESPERANTISTS. THE LARGEST IS THE WORLD CONGRESS OF ESPERANTO WHICH IS HELD IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY EACH YEAR. IN RECENT YEARS AROUND 2 000 PEOPLE HAVE ATTENDED IT FROM 60 OR MORE COUNTRIES. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THERE IS INTERNATIONAL YOUTH CONGRESS OF ESPERANTO.
A LOT OF DIFFERENT CULTURAL ACTIVITIES TAKE PLACE DURING ESPERANTO MEETINGS CONCERTS OF ESPERANTO MUSICIANS DRAMAS DISCOS PRESENTATIONS OF THE CULTURE OF THE HOST COUNTRY AND CULTURE OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE PARTICIPANTS LECTURES LANGUAGE COURSES AND SO ON. AT THE LOCATION OF ESPERANTO MEETINGS THERE IS ALSO A PUB A TEAROOM A BOOKSTORE ETC. WITH ESPERANTO SPEAKING WORKERS. THE NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES AND POSSIBILITIES DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OR ON THE THEME OF THE MEETING.
THERE ARE BOOKS AND MAGAZINES WRITTEN IN ESPERANTO. MUCH LITERATURE HAS BEEN TRANSLATED INTO ESPERANTO FROM OTHER LANGUAGES INCLUDING FAMOUS WORKS LIKE THE BIBLE FIRST TIME IN 1926 AND PLAYS BY SHAKESPEARE. WORKS THAT ARE LESS FAMOUS HAVE ALSO BEEN TRANSLATED INTO ESPERANTO AND SOME OF THESE DO NOT HAVE ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS.
IMPORTANT ESPERANTO WRITERS ARE FOR EXAMPLE TREVOR STEELE AUSTRALIA ISTV N NEMERE HUNGARY AND MAO ZIFU CHINA. WILLIAM AULD WAS A BRITISH WRITER OF POETRY IN ESPERANTO AND HONORARY PRESIDENT OF THE ESPERANTO PEN CENTRE ESPERANTO PART OF INTERNATIONAL PEN. SOME PEOPLE RECOMMENDED HIM FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE.
THERE IS MUSIC OF DIFFERENT GENRES IN ESPERANTO INCLUDING FOLK SONGS ROCK MUSIC CABARET SONGS FOR SOLO SINGERS CHOIRS AND OPERA. AMONG ACTIVE ESPERANTO MUSICIANS IS FOR EXAMPLE SWEDISH SOCIO CRITICAL MAKE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT BAD THINGS IN THE SOCIETY MUSIC GROUP LA PERDITA GENERACIO OCCITAN FROM THE SOUTH OF FRANCE SINGER JOMO THE FINNISH GROUP DOLCHAMAR BRAZILIAN GROUP SUPERNOVA FRISIAN GROUP KAJTO OR POLISH SINGER SONGWRITER GEORGO HANDZLIK. ALSO SOME POPULAR MUSIC WRITERS AND ARTISTS INCLUDING ELVIS COSTELLO AND AMERICAN SINGER MICHAEL JACKSON RECORDED SONGS IN ESPERANTO COMPOSED SONGS INSPIRED BY THE LANGUAGE OR USED IT IN THEIR PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS. SOME SONGS FROM THE ALBUM ESPERANTO FROM WARNER BROS. WHICH RELEASED ALL IN ESPERANTO IN SPAIN IN NOVEMBER 1996 REACHED A HIGH POSITION IN THE SPANISH RECORD CHARTS SIMILARLY IN 1999 IN GERMANY HIP HOP MUSIC GROUP FREUNDESKREIS BECAME FAMOUS WITH THEIR SINGLE ESPERANTO. CLASSICAL WORKS FOR ORCHESTRA AND CHOIR WITH TEXTS IN ESPERANTO ARE LA KORO SUTRO BY LOU HARRISON AND THE FIRST SYMPHONY BY DAVID GAINES BOTH ARE FROM THE USA. IN TOULOUSE FRANCE THERE IS VINILKOSMO WHICH PRODUCES ESPERANTO MUSIC. THE MAIN INTERNET ESPERANTO SONGBOOK KANTARVIKI HAS GOT 3 000 SONGS IN MAY 2013 BOTH ORIGINAL AND TRANSLATED.
THEY PLAY DRAMAS FROM DIFFERENT WRITERS SUCH AS CARLO GOLDONI EUG NE IONESCO AND WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE ALSO IN ESPERANTO. FILMMAKERS SOMETIMES USE ESPERANTO IN THE BACKGROUND OF FILMS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE GREAT DICTATOR BY CHARLIE CHAPLIN IN THE ACTION FILM BLADE TRINITY OR IN COMEDY SCI FI TELEVISION SERIES RED DWARF. FEATURE FILMS IN ESPERANTO ARE NOT VERY COMMON BUT THERE ARE ABOUT 15 FEATURE FILMS WHICH HAVE ESPERANTO THEMES.
THE 1966 FILM INCUBUS IS NOTABLE BECAUSE ITS DIALOGUES ARE IN ESPERANTO ONLY. TODAY SOME PEOPLE TRANSLATE SUBTITLES OF DIFFERENT FILMS TO ESPERANTO. THE WEBSITE VERDA FILMEJO COLLECTS THESE SUBTITLES.
RADIO STATIONS IN BRAZIL CHINA CUBA AND VATICAN BROADCAST REGULAR PROGRAMMES IN ESPERANTO. SOME OTHER RADIO PROGRAMMES AND PODCASTS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET. INTERNET RADIO STATION MUZAIKO BROADCASTS ESPERANTO PROGRAMMES ON THE INTERNET 24 HOURS A DAY SINCE JULY 2011. BETWEEN 2005 AND 2006 THERE WAS ALSO A PROJECT OF INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION INTERNACIA TELEVIDO IN ESPERANTO. ESPERANTO TV BROADCASTS ON THE INTERNET FROM SYDNEY AUSTRALIA SINCE 5 APRIL 2014.
ON THE INTERNET THERE ARE MANY ONLINE DISCUSSIONS IN ESPERANTO ABOUT DIFFERENT TOPICS. THERE ARE MANY WEBSITES BLOGS PODCASTS VIDEOS TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS IN ESPERANTO SEE ABOVE. GOOGLE TRANSLATE SUPPORTS TRANSLATIONS FROM AND INTO ESPERANTO SINCE 22 FEBRUARY 2012 AS ITS 64TH LANGUAGE.
APART FROM WEBSITES AND BLOGS OF ESPERANTISTS AND ESPERANTO ORGANIZATIONS THERE IS ALSO AN ESPERANTO WIKIPEDIA AND OTHER PROJECTS OF WIKIMEDIA FOUNDATION WHICH HAS ALSO GOT THEIR ESPERANTO LANGUAGE VERSION OR THEY USE ESPERANTO WIKIBOOKS WIKISOURCE WIKINEWS WIKIMEDIA COMMONS AND WIKIDATA. PEOPLE CAN ALSO USE AN ESPERANTO VERSION OF SOCIAL NETWORKS INCLUDING FACEBOOK DIASPORA AND OTHER WEBSITES.
SEVERAL COMPUTER PROGRAMMES ALSO HAVE AN ESPERANTO VERSION SUCH AS WEB BROWSER FIREFOX AND OFFICE SUITE SET OF PROGRAMMES FOR USE IN AN OFFICE LIBREOFFICE.
ESPERANTO USES GRAMMAR AND WORDS FROM MANY NATURAL LANGUAGES SUCH AS LATIN RUSSIAN AND FRENCH. MORPHEMES IN ESPERANTO THE SMALLEST PARTS OF A WORD THAT CAN HAVE A MEANING CANNOT BE CHANGED AND PEOPLE CAN COMBINE THEM INTO MANY DIFFERENT WORDS. THE LANGUAGE HAS GOT COMMON ATTRIBUTES WITH ISOLATING LANGUAGES THEY USE WORD ORDER TO CHANGE THE MEANING OF A SENTENCE SUCH AS CHINESE WHILE THE INNER STRUCTURE OF ESPERANTO WORDS HAS GOT COMMON ATTRIBUTES WITH AGGLUTINATIVE LANGUAGES THEY USE AFFIXES TO CHANGE THE MEANING OF A WORD SUCH AS TURKISH SWAHILI AND JAPANESE.
THE ESPERANTO ALPHABET HAS 28 LETTERS. THESE LETTERS ARE 
THERE IS NO Q W X OR Y IN THE ESPERANTO ALPHABET. THE LETTERS HAVE DIACRITICS OR ACCENT MARKS. SINCE X IS NOT USED IN ESPERANTO THEY CAN WRITE THESE LETTERS AS CX GX HX JX SX UX. THEY CALL THIS WAY OF WRITING AS THE X SISTEMO X SYSTEM.
ZAMENHOF INVENTED A WAY OF WRITING LETTERS WITH DIACRITICS WHICH USES THE LETTER H AS A HELPING LETTER EXCEPT OF U. WHEN PEOPLE USE THIS THEY CAN WRITE THE LETTERS AS CH GH HH JH SH AND U. THEY CALL THIS WAY OF WRITING AS THE H SISTEMO H SYSTEM.
THERE WAS PROBLEM WITH WRITING ESPERANTO DIACRITIC LETTERS ON COMPUTERS IN THE PAST. PEOPLE HAD TO USE EITHER THE H SYSTEM OR THE X SYSTEM. SINCE TODAY S PROGRAMMES CAN USE UNICODE THERE IS NO SUCH PROBLEM ANYMORE. HOWEVER SOME PEOPLE STILL USE THESE SYSTEMS TO WRITE IN ESPERANTO WHEN THEY DO NOT HAVE ESPERANTO DIACRITIC LETTERS ON THEIR KEYBOARDS.
ESPERANTO S GRAMMAR RULES OF LANGUAGE IS MEANT TO BE SIMPLE. THE RULES IN ESPERANTO NEVER CHANGE AND CAN ALWAYS BE APPLIED IN THE SAME WAY.
ESPERANTO HAS ONLY DEFINITE ARTICLE LA THE SAME THING AS THE IN ENGLISH AND NO INDEFINITE ARTICLE THE SAME THING AS A OR AN IN ENGLISH. THEY USE DEFINITE ARTICLE WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THINGS ABOUT WHICH THEY HAVE ALREADY TOLD SOMETHING.
NOUNS END WITH O. FOR EXAMPLE PATRO MEANS FATHER. TO MAKE A NOUN PLURAL ADD J. FOR EXAMPLE PATROJ MEANS FATHERS.
ADJECTIVES END WITH A ADVERBS END WITH E FOR EXAMPLE GRANDA MEANS BIG BONA MEANS GOOD BONE MEANS WELL.
THE N ENDING IS THE MARK OF THE DIRECT OBJECT THE ACCUSATIVE CASE IN NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE 
IN ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS IS COMPARISON MADE BY WORDS PLI MORE AND PLEJ MOST. FOR EXAMPLE 
SO TO SAY HOW OLD SOMEBODY IS IN ESPERANTO JUST SAY 
VERBS END WITH AS WHEN THEY ARE IN PRESENT TENSE. ENGLISH USES I AM YOU ARE HE IS. BUT IN ESPERANTO THERE IS JUST ONE WORD FOR AM ARE IS ESTAS. SIMILARLY KURAS CAN MEAN RUN OR RUNS. INFINITIVES END WITH I. FOR EXAMPLE ESTI MEANS TO BE POVI MEANS TO CAN. IT IS EASY TO MAKE PAST TENSE ALWAYS ADD IS ENDING. TO MAKE FUTURE TENSE ADD OS. FOR EXAMPLE 
MANY WORDS CAN BE MADE OPPOSITE BY ADDING MAL AT THE BEGINNING.
EXAMPLES OF SENTENCES WHICH SHOW THE RULES 
TO MAKE A YES OR NO QUESTION ADD U AT THE BEGINNING. FOR EXAMPLE 
UNLIKE IN ENGLISH THEY CAN ANSWER TO A YES NO QUESTION ONLY JES YES OR NE NO.
THE NUMBERS ARE 
NUMBERS LIKE TWENTY ONE 21 ARE MADE BY THEIR COMPOUNDING BY ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. FOR EXAMPLE DEK TRI MEANS THIRTEEN 13 DUDEK TRI MEANS TWENTY THREE 23 SESCENT OKDEK TRI MEANS SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE 683 MIL NA CENT OKDEK TRI MEANS ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE 1983.
ESPERANTO HAS OVER 20 SPECIAL WORDS WHICH CAN CHANGE THE MEANING OF ANOTHER WORD. PEOPLE PUT THEM BEFORE OR AFTER THE ROOT OF A WORD.
THESE WORDS COMBINED CAN MAKE VERY LONG WORDS SUCH AS MALMULTEKOSTA CHEAP VENDREDVIANDMAN MALPERMESO PROHIBITION OF EATING A MEAT ON FRIDAY.
PREFIXES ARE ADDED BEFORE THE ROOT OF THE WORD.
SUFFIXES ARE ADDED AFTER THE ROOT OF THE WORD BUT BEFORE THE ENDING.
SOME OF THE CRITICISM OF ESPERANTO IS COMMON FOR ANY PROJECT OF CONSTRUCTED INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE A NEW LANGUAGE HAS LITTLE CHANCE TO REPLACE TODAY S INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGES LIKE ENGLISH FRENCH AND OTHERS.
THE CRITICISM WHICH IS SPECIFIC FOR ESPERANTO TARGETS VARIOUS PARTS OF THE LANGUAGE ITSELF THE SPECIAL ESPERANTO LETTERS THE N ENDING SOUND OF THE LANGUAGE AND SO ON.
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT USE OF THE DIACRITICS THE LETTERS MAKE THE LANGUAGE LESS NEUTRAL THAN IT WOULD BE USING ONLY THE BASIC LETTERS OF LATIN ALPHABET. NO OTHER LANGUAGE USES THE LETTERS AND.
CRITICS OF ESPERANTO ALSO SAY THAT THE SAME ENDING OF AN ADJECTIVE AND A NOUN SUCH AS IS UNNECESSARY. ENGLISH FOR EXAMPLE DOES NOT HAVE THE REQUIREMENT THAT AN ADJECTIVE AND NOUN MUST AGREE IN TENSE AND HAS NO INDICATOR FOR ACCUSATIVE CASES.
THEY ALSO CRITICISE THAT MOST OF THE WORDS IN ESPERANTO COME FROM INDO EUROPEAN LANGUAGES WHICH MAKES THE LANGUAGE LESS NEUTRAL.
ONE OF THE COMMON CRITICISMS FROM BOTH NON ESPERANTO SPEAKERS AND THOSE WHO SPEAK ESPERANTO IS THAT THERE IS LANGUAGE SEXISM IN ESPERANTO. SOME WORDS BY DEFAULT REFER TO MALES AND THE FEMININE COUNTERPARTS HAVE TO BE CONSTRUCTED BY ADDING THE IN SUFFIX TO THE MASCULINE ROOT. SUCH A WORDS ARE WORDS LIKE FATHER AND MOTHER SON AND DAUGHTER UNCLE AND AUNT AND SO ON. THE MAJORITY OF ALL ESPERANTO WORDS HAVE NO SPECIFIC MEANING ON THE BASIS OF SEX. SOME PEOPLE PROPOSED THE SUFFIX I WITH MALE MEANING IN ORDER TO MAKE THE MEANING OF THE BASIC WORD NEUTRAL. HOWEVER THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT WIDELY ACCEPTED BY ESPERANTO SPEAKERS.
CRITICISM OF SOME PARTS OF ESPERANTO LANGUAGE WAS REASON FOR CREATION OF SOME NEW CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGES LIKE IDO NOVIAL INTERLINGUA NEOSLAVONIC LANGUAGE AND LOJBAN. HOWEVER NONE OF THESE CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGES HAVE AS MANY SPEAKERS AS ESPERANTO DOES.
NORMAL SAMPLE 
VERSION IN X SYSTEM 
VERSION IN H SYSTEM 
SIMPLE ENGLISH TRANSLATION ALL PEOPLE ARE FREE AND EQUAL IN DIGNITY AND RIGHTS. THEY ARE REASONABLE AND MORAL AND SHOULD ACT KINDLY TO EACH OTHER.
PEOPLE SOMETIMES USE THE WORD ESPERANTO IN A METAPHORIC WAY NOT IN ITS LITERAL SENSE. THEY USE IT TO SAY THAT SOMETHING AIMS TO BE INTERNATIONAL OR NEUTRAL OR IT USES A WIDE MIXTURE OF IDEAS. THEY SAY THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE JAVA IS INDEPENDENT OF SPECIFIC COMPUTER SYSTEMS E.G. WINDOWS ANDROID LIKE ESPERANTO IS INDEPENDENT OF... NATIONS. SIMILARLY THEY CALL THE FONT NOTO THE ESPERANTO OF FONTS BECAUSE IT TRIES TO WORK WELL FOR EVERY CULTURE S WRITING.
EVOLUTION
EVOLUTION IS A SCIENTIFIC THEORY USED BY BIOLOGISTS. IT EXPLAINS HOW LIVING THINGS CHANGE OVER A LONG TIME AND HOW THEY HAVE COME TO BE THE WAY THEY ARE.
EARTH IS VERY OLD. BY STUDYING THE LAYERS OF ROCK THAT MAKE UP EARTH S CRUST SCIENTISTS CAN FIND OUT ABOUT ITS PAST. THIS KIND OF RESEARCH IS CALLED HISTORICAL GEOLOGY.
IT IS KNOWN THAT LIVING THINGS HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME BECAUSE THEIR REMAINS CAN BE SEEN IN THE ROCKS. THESE REMAINS ARE CALLED FOSSILS. THIS PROVES THAT THE ANIMALS AND PLANTS OF TODAY ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF LONG AGO. THE OLDER THE FOSSILS THE BIGGER THE DIFFERENCES FROM MODERN FORMS. HOW HAS THIS COME ABOUT EVOLUTION HAS TAKEN PLACE. THAT EVOLUTION HAS TAKEN PLACE IS A FACT BECAUSE IT IS OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTED BY MANY LINES OF EVIDENCE. AT THE SAME TIME EVOLUTIONARY QUESTIONS ARE STILL BEING ACTIVELY RESEARCHED BY BIOLOGISTS.
COMPARISON OF DNA SEQUENCES ALLOWS ORGANISMS TO BE GROUPED BY HOW SIMILAR THEIR SEQUENCES ARE. IN 2010 AN ANALYSIS COMPARED SEQUENCES TO PHYLOGENETIC TREES AND SUPPORTED THE IDEA OF COMMON DESCENT. THERE IS NOW STRONG QUANTITATIVE SUPPORT BY A FORMAL TEST FOR THE UNITY OF LIFE.
THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION IS THE BASIS OF MODERN BIOLOGY. THEODOSIUS DOBZHANSKY A WELL KNOWN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST HAS SAID NOTHING IN BIOLOGY MAKES SENSE EXCEPT IN THE LIGHT OF EVOLUTION.
THE EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION IS GIVEN IN A NUMBER OF BOOKS. SOME OF THIS EVIDENCE IS DISCUSSED HERE.
THE REALIZATION THAT SOME ROCKS CONTAIN FOSSILS WAS A VERY IMPORTANT EVENT IN NATURAL HISTORY. THERE ARE THREE PARTS TO THIS STORY 
THE EVOLUTION OF THE HORSE FAMILY EQUIDAE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE WAY THAT EVOLUTION WORKS. THE OLDEST FOSSIL OF A HORSE IS ABOUT 52 MILLION YEARS OLD. IT WAS A SMALL ANIMAL WITH FIVE TOES ON THE FRONT FEET AND FOUR ON THE HIND FEET. AT THAT TIME THERE WERE MORE FORESTS IN THE WORLD THAN TODAY. THIS HORSE LIVED IN WOODLAND EATING LEAVES NUTS AND FRUIT WITH ITS SIMPLE TEETH. IT WAS ONLY ABOUT AS BIG AS A FOX.
ABOUT 30 MILLION YEARS AGO THE WORLD STARTED TO BECOME COOLER AND DRIER. FORESTS SHRANK GRASSLAND EXPANDED AND HORSES CHANGED. THEY ATE GRASS THEY GREW LARGER AND THEY RAN FASTER BECAUSE THEY HAD TO ESCAPE FASTER PREDATORS. BECAUSE GRASS WEARS TEETH OUT HORSES WITH LONGER LASTING TEETH HAD AN ADVANTAGE.
FOR MOST OF THIS LONG PERIOD OF TIME THERE WERE A NUMBER OF HORSE TYPES GENERA. NOW HOWEVER ONLY ONE GENUS EXISTS THE MODERN HORSE EQUUS. IT HAS TEETH WHICH GROW ALL ITS LIFE HOOVES ON SINGLE TOES GREAT LONG LEGS FOR RUNNING AND THE ANIMAL IS BIG AND STRONG ENOUGH TO SURVIVE IN THE OPEN PLAIN. HORSES LIVED IN WESTERN CANADA UNTIL 12 000 YEARS AGO BUT ALL HORSES IN NORTH AMERICA BECAME EXTINCT ABOUT 11 000 YEARS AGO. THE CAUSES OF THIS EXTINCTION ARE NOT YET CLEAR. CLIMATE CHANGE AND OVER HUNTING BY HUMANS ARE SUGGESTED.
SO SCIENTISTS CAN SEE THAT CHANGES HAVE HAPPENED. THEY HAVE HAPPENED SLOWLY OVER A LONG TIME. HOW THESE CHANGES HAVE COME ABOUT IS EXPLAINED BY THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION.
THIS IS A TOPIC WHICH FASCINATED BOTH CHARLES DARWIN AND ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE. WHEN NEW SPECIES OCCUR USUALLY BY THE SPLITTING OF OLDER SPECIES THIS TAKES PLACE IN ONE PLACE IN THE WORLD. ONCE IT IS ESTABLISHED A NEW SPECIES MAY SPREAD TO SOME PLACES AND NOT OTHERS.
AUSTRALASIA HAS BEEN SEPARATED FROM OTHER CONTINENTS FOR MANY MILLIONS OF YEARS. IN THE MAIN PART OF THE CONTINENT AUSTRALIA 83 OF MAMMALS 89 OF REPTILES 90 OF FISH AND INSECTS AND 93 OF AMPHIBIANS ARE ENDEMIC. ITS NATIVE MAMMALS ARE MOSTLY MARSUPIALS LIKE KANGAROOS BANDICOOTS AND QUOLLS. BY CONTRAST MARSUPIALS ARE TODAY TOTALLY ABSENT FROM AFRICA AND FORM A SMALL PORTION OF THE MAMMALIAN FAUNA OF SOUTH AMERICA WHERE OPOSSUMS SHREW OPOSSUMS AND THE MONITO DEL MONTE OCCUR SEE THE GREAT AMERICAN INTERCHANGE.
THE ONLY LIVING REPRESENTATIVES OF PRIMITIVE EGG LAYING MAMMALS MONOTREMES ARE THE ECHIDNAS AND THE PLATYPUS. THEY ARE ONLY FOUND IN AUSTRALASIA WHICH INCLUDES TASMANIA NEW GUINEA AND KANGAROO ISLAND. THESE MONOTREMES ARE TOTALLY ABSENT IN THE REST OF THE WORLD. ON THE OTHER HAND AUSTRALIA IS MISSING MANY GROUPS OF PLACENTAL MAMMALS THAT ARE COMMON ON OTHER CONTINENTS CARNIVORA ARTIODACTYLS SHREWS SQUIRRELS LAGOMORPHS ALTHOUGH IT DOES HAVE INDIGENOUS BATS AND RODENTS WHICH ARRIVED LATER.
THE EVOLUTIONARY STORY IS THAT PLACENTAL MAMMALS EVOLVED IN EURASIA AND WIPED OUT THE MARSUPIALS AND MONOTREMES WHEREVER THEY SPREAD. THEY DID NOT REACH AUSTRALASIA UNTIL MORE RECENTLY. THAT IS THE SIMPLE REASON WHY AUSTRALIA HAS MOST OF THE WORLD S MARSUPIALS AND ALL THE WORLD S MONOTREMES.
IN ABOUT THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS HAVE THE MOST DIVERSE COLLECTION OF DROSOPHILA FLIES IN THE WORLD LIVING FROM RAINFORESTS TO MOUNTAIN MEADOWS. ABOUT 800 HAWAIIAN DROSOPHILID SPECIES ARE KNOWN.
GENETIC EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT ALL THE NATIVE DROSOPHILID SPECIES IN HAWAII HAVE DESCENDED FROM A SINGLE ANCESTRAL SPECIES THAT COLONIZED THE ISLANDS ABOUT 20 MILLION YEARS AGO. THE SUBSEQUENT ADAPTIVE RADIATION WAS SPURRED BY A LACK OF COMPETITION AND A WIDE VARIETY OF VACANT NICHES. ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR A SINGLE PREGNANT FEMALE TO COLONISE AN ISLAND IT IS MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN A GROUP FROM THE SAME SPECIES.
THE COMBINATION OF CONTINENTAL DRIFT AND EVOLUTION CAN EXPLAIN WHAT IS FOUND IN THE FOSSIL RECORD. GLOSSOPTERIS IS AN EXTINCT SPECIES OF SEED FERN PLANTS FROM THE PERMIAN PERIOD ON THE ANCIENT SUPERCONTINENT OF GONDWANA.
GLOSSOPTERIS FOSSILS ARE FOUND IN PERMIAN STRATA IN SOUTHEAST SOUTH AMERICA SOUTHEAST AFRICA ALL OF MADAGASCAR NORTHERN INDIA ALL OF AUSTRALIA ALL OF NEW ZEALAND AND SCATTERED ON THE SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN EDGES OF ANTARCTICA.
DURING THE PERMIAN THESE CONTINENTS WERE CONNECTED AS GONDWANA. THIS IS KNOWN FROM MAGNETIC STRIPING IN THE ROCKS OTHER FOSSIL DISTRIBUTIONS AND GLACIAL SCRATCHES POINTING AWAY FROM THE TEMPERATE CLIMATE OF THE SOUTH POLE DURING THE PERMIAN.
WHEN BIOLOGISTS LOOK AT LIVING THINGS THEY SEE THAT ANIMALS AND PLANTS BELONG TO GROUPS WHICH HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON. CHARLES DARWIN EXPLAINED THAT THIS FOLLOWED NATURALLY IF WE ADMIT THE COMMON PARENTAGE OF ALLIED FORMS TOGETHER WITH THEIR MODIFICATION THROUGH VARIATION AND NATURAL SELECTION.
FOR EXAMPLE ALL INSECTS ARE RELATED. THEY SHARE A BASIC BODY PLAN WHOSE DEVELOPMENT IS CONTROLLED BY MASTER REGULATORY GENES. THEY HAVE SIX LEGS THEY HAVE HARD PARTS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BODY AN EXOSKELETON THEY HAVE EYES FORMED OF MANY SEPARATE CHAMBERS AND SO ON. BIOLOGISTS EXPLAIN THIS WITH EVOLUTION. ALL INSECTS ARE THE DESCENDANTS OF A GROUP OF ANIMALS WHO LIVED A LONG TIME AGO. THEY STILL KEEP THE BASIC PLAN SIX LEGS AND SO ON BUT THE DETAILS CHANGE. THEY LOOK DIFFERENT NOW BECAUSE THEY CHANGED IN DIFFERENT WAYS THIS IS EVOLUTION.
IT WAS DARWIN WHO FIRST SUGGESTED THAT ALL LIFE ON EARTH HAD A SINGLE ORIGIN AND FROM THAT BEGINNING ENDLESS FORMS MOST BEAUTIFUL AND MOST WONDERFUL HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING EVOLVED. EVIDENCE FROM MOLECULAR BIOLOGY IN RECENT YEARS HAS SUPPORTED THE IDEA THAT ALL LIFE IS RELATED BY COMMON DESCENT.
STRONG EVIDENCE FOR COMMON DESCENT COMES FROM VESTIGIAL STRUCTURES. THE USELESS WINGS OF FLIGHTLESS BEETLES ARE SEALED UNDER FUSED WING COVERS. THIS CAN BE SIMPLY EXPLAINED BY THEIR DESCENT FROM ANCESTRAL BEETLES WHICH HAD WINGS THAT WORKED.
RUDIMENTARY BODY PARTS THOSE THAT ARE SMALLER AND SIMPLER IN STRUCTURE THAN CORRESPONDING PARTS IN ANCESTRAL SPECIES ARE CALLED VESTIGIAL ORGANS. THOSE ORGANS ARE FUNCTIONAL IN THE ANCESTRAL SPECIES BUT ARE NOW EITHER NONFUNCTIONAL OR RE ADAPTED TO A NEW FUNCTION. EXAMPLES ARE THE PELVIC GIRDLES OF WHALES HALTERES HIND WINGS OF FLIES WINGS OF FLIGHTLESS BIRDS AND THE LEAVES OF SOME XEROPHYTES E.G. CACTUS AND PARASITIC PLANTS E.G. DODDER.
HOWEVER VESTIGIAL STRUCTURES MAY HAVE THEIR ORIGINAL FUNCTION REPLACED WITH ANOTHER. FOR EXAMPLE THE HALTERES IN FLIES HELP BALANCE THE INSECT WHILE IN FLIGHT AND THE WINGS OF OSTRICHES ARE USED IN MATING RITUALS AND IN AGGRESSIVE DISPLAY. THE EAR OSSICLES IN MAMMALS ARE FORMER BONES OF THE LOWER JAW.
IN 1893 ROBERT WIEDERSHEIM PUBLISHED A BOOK ON HUMAN ANATOMY AND ITS RELEVANCE TO MAN S EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY. THIS BOOK CONTAINED A LIST OF 86 HUMAN ORGANS THAT HE CONSIDERED VESTIGIAL. THIS LIST INCLUDED EXAMPLES SUCH AS THE APPENDIX AND THE 3RD MOLAR TEETH WISDOM TEETH.
THE STRONG GRIP OF A BABY IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE. IT IS A VESTIGIAL REFLEX A REMNANT OF THE PAST WHEN PRE HUMAN BABIES CLUNG TO THEIR MOTHERS HAIR AS THE MOTHERS SWUNG THROUGH THE TREES. THIS IS BORNE OUT BY THE BABIES FEET WHICH CURL UP WHEN IT IS SITTING DOWN PRIMATE BABIES GRIP WITH THE FEET AS WELL. ALL PRIMATES EXCEPT MODERN MAN HAVE THICK BODY HAIR TO WHICH AN INFANT CAN CLING UNLIKE MODERN HUMANS. THE GRASP REFLEX ALLOWS THE MOTHER TO ESCAPE DANGER BY CLIMBING A TREE USING BOTH HANDS AND FEET.
VESTIGIAL ORGANS OFTEN HAVE SOME SELECTION AGAINST THEM. THE ORIGINAL ORGANS TOOK RESOURCES SOMETIMES HUGE RESOURCES. IF THEY NO LONGER HAVE A FUNCTION REDUCING THEIR SIZE IMPROVES FITNESS. AND THERE IS DIRECT EVIDENCE OF SELECTION. SOME CAVE CRUSTACEA REPRODUCE MORE SUCCESSFULLY WITH SMALLER EYES THAN DO THOSE WITH LARGER EYES. THIS MAY BE BECAUSE THE NERVOUS TISSUE DEALING WITH SIGHT NOW BECOMES AVAILABLE TO HANDLE OTHER SENSORY INPUT.
FROM THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IT WAS KNOWN THAT EMBRYOS OF DIFFERENT SPECIES WERE MUCH MORE SIMILAR THAN THE ADULTS. IN PARTICULAR SOME PARTS OF EMBRYOS REFLECT THEIR EVOLUTIONARY PAST. FOR EXAMPLE THE EMBRYOS OF LAND VERTEBRATES DEVELOP GILL SLITS LIKE FISH EMBRYOS. OF COURSE THIS IS ONLY A TEMPORARY STAGE WHICH GIVES RISE TO MANY STRUCTURES IN THE NECK OF REPTILES BIRDS AND MAMMALS. THE PROTO GILL SLITS ARE PART OF A COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF DEVELOPMENT THAT IS WHY THEY PERSISTED.
ANOTHER EXAMPLE ARE THE EMBRYONIC TEETH OF BALEEN WHALES. THEY ARE LATER LOST. THE BALEEN FILTER IS DEVELOPED FROM DIFFERENT TISSUE CALLED KERATIN. EARLY FOSSIL BALEEN WHALES DID ACTUALLY HAVE TEETH AS WELL AS THE BALEEN.
A GOOD EXAMPLE IS THE BARNACLE. IT TOOK MANY CENTURIES BEFORE NATURAL HISTORIANS DISCOVERED THAT BARNACLES WERE CRUSTACEA. THEIR ADULTS LOOK SO UNLIKE OTHER CRUSTACEA BUT THEIR LARVAE ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF OTHER CRUSTACEA.
CHARLES DARWIN LIVED IN A WORLD WHERE ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DOMESTICATED CROPS WERE VITALLY IMPORTANT. IN BOTH CASES FARMERS SELECTED FOR BREEDING INDIVIDUALS WITH SPECIAL PROPERTIES AND PREVENTED THE BREEDING OF INDIVIDUALS WITH LESS DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS. THE EIGHTEENTH AND EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY SAW A GROWTH IN SCIENTIFIC AGRICULTURE AND ARTIFICIAL BREEDING WAS PART OF THIS.
DARWIN DISCUSSED ARTIFICIAL SELECTION AS A MODEL FOR NATURAL SELECTION IN THE 1859 FIRST EDITION OF HIS WORK ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES IN CHAPTER IV NATURAL SELECTION 
NIKOLAI VAVILOV SHOWED THAT RYE ORIGINALLY A WEED CAME TO BE A CROP PLANT BY UNINTENTIONAL SELECTION. RYE IS A TOUGHER PLANT THAN WHEAT IT SURVIVES IN HARSHER CONDITIONS. HAVING BECOME A CROP LIKE THE WHEAT RYE WAS ABLE TO BECOME A CROP PLANT IN HARSH AREAS SUCH AS HILLS AND MOUNTAINS.
THERE IS NO REAL DIFFERENCE IN THE GENETIC PROCESSES UNDERLYING ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL SELECTION AND THE CONCEPT OF ARTIFICIAL SELECTION WAS USED BY CHARLES DARWIN AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE WIDER PROCESS OF NATURAL SELECTION. THERE ARE PRACTICAL DIFFERENCES. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF ARTIFICIAL SELECTION SHOW THAT THE RATE OF EVOLUTION IN SELECTION EXPERIMENTS IS AT LEAST TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE THAT IS 100 TIMES GREATER THAN ANY RATE SEEN IN NATURE OR THE FOSSIL RECORD.
SOME HAVE THOUGHT THAT ARTIFICIAL SELECTION COULD NOT PRODUCE NEW SPECIES. IT NOW SEEMS THAT IT CAN.
NEW SPECIES HAVE BEEN CREATED BY DOMESTICATED ANIMAL HUSBANDRY BUT THE DETAILS ARE NOT KNOWN OR NOT CLEAR. FOR EXAMPLE DOMESTIC SHEEP WERE CREATED BY HYBRIDISATION AND NO LONGER PRODUCE VIABLE OFFSPRING WITH OVIS ORIENTALIS ONE SPECIES FROM WHICH THEY ARE DESCENDED. DOMESTIC CATTLE ON THE OTHER HAND CAN BE CONSIDERED THE SAME SPECIES AS SEVERAL VARIETIES OF WILD OX GAUR YAK ETC. AS THEY READILY PRODUCE FERTILE OFFSPRING WITH THEM.
THE BEST DOCUMENTED NEW SPECIES CAME FROM LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS IN THE LATE 1980S. WILLIAM RICE AND G.W. SALT BRED FRUIT FLIES DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER USING A MAZE WITH THREE DIFFERENT CHOICES OF HABITAT SUCH AS LIGHT DARK AND WET DRY. EACH GENERATION WAS PUT INTO THE MAZE AND THE GROUPS OF FLIES THAT CAME OUT OF TWO OF THE EIGHT EXITS WERE SET APART TO BREED WITH EACH OTHER IN THEIR RESPECTIVE GROUPS.
AFTER THIRTY FIVE GENERATIONS THE TWO GROUPS AND THEIR OFFSPRING WERE ISOLATED REPRODUCTIVELY BECAUSE OF THEIR STRONG HABITAT PREFERENCES THEY MATED ONLY WITHIN THE AREAS THEY PREFERRED AND SO DID NOT MATE WITH FLIES THAT PREFERRED THE OTHER AREAS.
DIANE DODD WAS ALSO ABLE TO SHOW HOW REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION CAN DEVELOP FROM MATING PREFERENCES IN DROSOPHILA PSEUDOOBSCURA FRUIT FLIES AFTER ONLY EIGHT GENERATIONS USING DIFFERENT FOOD TYPES STARCH AND MALTOSE.
DODD S EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN EASY FOR OTHERS TO REPEAT. IT HAS ALSO BEEN DONE WITH OTHER FRUIT FLIES AND FOODS.
SOME BIOLOGISTS SAY THAT EVOLUTION HAS HAPPENED WHEN A TRAIT THAT IS CAUSED BY GENETICS BECOMES MORE OR LESS COMMON IN A GROUP OF ORGANISMS. OTHERS CALL IT EVOLUTION WHEN NEW SPECIES APPEAR.
CHANGES CAN HAPPEN QUICKLY IN THE SMALLER SIMPLER ORGANISMS. FOR EXAMPLE MANY BACTERIA THAT CAUSE DISEASE CAN NO LONGER BE KILLED WITH SOME OF THE ANTIBIOTIC MEDICINES. THESE MEDICINES HAVE ONLY BEEN IN USE ABOUT EIGHTY YEARS AND AT FIRST WORKED EXTREMELY WELL. THE BACTERIA HAVE EVOLVED SO THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER AFFECTED BY ANTIBIOTICS ANYMORE. THE DRUGS KILLED OFF ALL THE BACTERIA EXCEPT A FEW WHICH HAD SOME RESISTANCE. THESE FEW RESISTANT BACTERIA PRODUCED THE NEXT GENERATION.
THE COLORADO BEETLE IS FAMOUS FOR ITS ABILITY TO RESIST PESTICIDES. OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS IT HAS BECOME RESISTANT TO 52 CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS USED IN INSECTICIDES INCLUDING CYANIDE. THIS IS NATURAL SELECTION SPEEDED UP BY THE ARTIFICIAL CONDITIONS. HOWEVER NOT EVERY POPULATION IS RESISTANT TO EVERY CHEMICAL. THE POPULATIONS ONLY BECOME RESISTANT TO CHEMICALS USED IN THEIR AREA.
ALTHOUGH THERE WERE A NUMBER OF NATURAL HISTORIANS IN THE 18TH CENTURY WHO HAD SOME IDEA OF EVOLUTION THE FIRST WELL FORMED IDEAS CAME IN THE 19TH CENTURY. THREE BIOLOGISTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT.
JEAN BAPTISTE DE LAMARCK 1744 1829 A FRENCH BIOLOGIST CLAIMED THAT ANIMALS CHANGED ACCORDING TO NATURAL LAWS. HE SAID THAT ANIMALS COULD PASS ON TRAITS THEY HAD ACQUIRED DURING THEIR LIFETIME TO THEIR OFFSPRING USING INHERITANCE. TODAY HIS THEORY IS KNOWN AS LAMARCKISM. ITS MAIN PURPOSE IS TO EXPLAIN ADAPTATIONS BY NATURAL MEANS. HE PROPOSED A TENDENCY FOR ORGANISMS TO BECOME MORE COMPLEX MOVING UP A LADDER OF PROGRESS PLUS USE AND DISUSE.
LAMARCK S IDEA WAS THAT A GIRAFFE S NECK GREW LONGER BECAUSE IT TRIED TO REACH HIGHER UP. THIS IDEA FAILED BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE RECONCILED WITH HEREDITY MENDEL S WORK. MENDEL MADE HIS DISCOVERIES ABOUT HALF A CENTURY AFTER LAMARCK S WORK.
CHARLES DARWIN 1809 1882 WROTE HIS ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES IN 1859. IN THIS BOOK HE PUT FORWARD MUCH EVIDENCE THAT EVOLUTION HAD OCCURRED. HE ALSO PROPOSED NATURAL SELECTION AS THE WAY EVOLUTION HAD TAKEN PLACE. BUT DARWIN DID NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT GENETICS AND HOW TRAITS WERE ACTUALLY PASSED ON. HE COULD NOT ACCURATELY EXPLAIN WHAT MADE CHILDREN LOOK LIKE THEIR PARENTS.
NEVERTHELESS DARWIN S EXPLANATION OF EVOLUTION WAS FUNDAMENTALLY CORRECT. IN CONTRAST TO LAMARCK DARWIN S IDEA WAS THAT THE GIRAFFE S NECK BECAME LONGER BECAUSE THOSE WITH LONGER NECKS SURVIVED BETTER. THESE SURVIVORS PASSED THEIR GENES ON AND IN TIME THE WHOLE RACE GOT LONGER NECKS.
AN AUSTRIAN MONK CALLED GREGOR MENDEL 1822 1884 BRED PLANTS. IN THE MID 19TH CENTURY HE DISCOVERED HOW TRAITS WERE PASSED ON FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT.
HE USED PEAS FOR HIS EXPERIMENTS SOME PEAS HAVE WHITE FLOWERS AND OTHERS HAVE RED ONES. SOME PEAS HAVE GREEN SEEDS AND OTHERS HAVE YELLOW SEEDS. MENDEL USED ARTIFICIAL POLLINATION TO BREED THE PEAS. HIS RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED FURTHER IN MENDELIAN INHERITANCE. DARWIN THOUGHT THAT THE INHERITANCE FROM BOTH PARENTS BLENDED TOGETHER. MENDEL PROVED THAT THE GENES FROM THE TWO PARENTS STAY SEPARATE AND MAY BE PASSED ON UNCHANGED TO LATER GENERATIONS.
MENDEL PUBLISHED HIS RESULTS IN A JOURNAL THAT WAS NOT WELL KNOWN AND HIS DISCOVERIES WERE OVERLOOKED. AROUND 1900 HIS WORK WAS REDISCOVERED. GENES ARE BITS OF INFORMATION MADE OF DNA WHICH WORK LIKE A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS. A SET OF GENES ARE IN EVERY LIVING CELL. TOGETHER GENES ORGANISE THE WAY AN EGG DEVELOPS INTO AN ADULT. WITH MAMMALS AND MANY OTHER LIVING THINGS A COPY OF EACH GENE COMES FROM THE FATHER AND ANOTHER COPY FROM THE MOTHER. SOME LIVING ORGANISMS INCLUDING SOME PLANTS ONLY HAVE ONE PARENT SO GET ALL THEIR GENES FROM THEM. THESE GENES PRODUCE THE GENETIC DIFFERENCES WHICH EVOLUTION ACTS ON.
DARWIN S ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES HAS TWO THEMES THE EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION AND HIS IDEAS ON HOW EVOLUTION TOOK PLACE. THIS SECTION DEALS WITH THE SECOND ISSUE.
THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS OF THE ORIGIN DEAL WITH VARIATION IN DOMESTICATED PLANTS AND ANIMALS AND VARIATION IN NATURE.
ALL LIVING THINGS SHOW VARIATION. EVERY POPULATION WHICH HAS BEEN STUDIED SHOWS THAT ANIMAL AND PLANTS VARY AS MUCH AS HUMANS DO. THIS IS A GREAT FACT OF NATURE AND WITHOUT IT EVOLUTION WOULD NOT OCCUR. DARWIN SAID THAT JUST AS MAN SELECTS WHAT HE WANTS IN HIS FARM ANIMALS SO IN NATURE THE VARIATIONS ALLOW NATURAL SELECTION TO WORK.
THE FEATURES OF AN INDIVIDUAL ARE INFLUENCED BY TWO THINGS HEREDITY AND ENVIRONMENT. FIRST DEVELOPMENT IS CONTROLLED BY GENES INHERITED FROM THE PARENTS. SECOND LIVING BRINGS ITS OWN INFLUENCES. SOME THINGS ARE ENTIRELY INHERITED OTHERS PARTLY AND SOME NOT INHERITED AT ALL.
THE COLOUR OF EYES IS ENTIRELY INHERITED THEY ARE A GENETIC TRAIT. HEIGHT OR WEIGHT IS ONLY PARTLY INHERITED AND THE LANGUAGE IS NOT AT ALL INHERITED. JUST TO BE CLEAR THE FACT THAT HUMANS CAN SPEAK IS INHERITED BUT WHAT LANGUAGE IS SPOKEN DEPENDS ON WHERE A PERSON LIVES AND WHAT THEY ARE TAUGHT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE A PERSON INHERITS A BRAIN OF SOMEWHAT VARIABLE CAPACITY. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER BIRTH DEPENDS ON MANY THINGS SUCH AS HOME ENVIRONMENT EDUCATION AND OTHER EXPERIENCES. WHEN A PERSON IS ADULT THEIR BRAIN IS WHAT THEIR INHERITANCE AND LIFE EXPERIENCE HAVE MADE IT.
EVOLUTION ONLY CONCERNS THE TRAITS WHICH CAN BE INHERITED WHOLLY OR PARTLY. THE HEREDITARY TRAITS ARE PASSED ON FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT THROUGH THE GENES. A PERSON S GENES CONTAIN ALL THE TRAITS WHICH THEY INHERIT FROM THEIR PARENTS. THE ACCIDENTS OF LIFE ARE NOT PASSED ON. ALSO OF COURSE EACH PERSON LIVES A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT LIFE THAT INCREASES THE DIFFERENCES.
ORGANISMS IN ANY POPULATION VARY IN REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF EVOLUTION REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS MEANS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OFFSPRING WHICH LIVE TO BREED AND LEAVE OFFSPRING THEMSELVES.
VARIATION CAN ONLY AFFECT FUTURE GENERATIONS IF IT IS INHERITED. BECAUSE OF THE WORK OF GREGOR MENDEL WE KNOW THAT MUCH VARIATION IS INHERITED. MENDEL S FACTORS ARE NOW CALLED GENES. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT ALMOST EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN A SEXUALLY REPRODUCING SPECIES IS GENETICALLY UNIQUE.
GENETIC VARIATION IS INCREASED BY GENE MUTATIONS. DNA DOES NOT ALWAYS REPRODUCE EXACTLY. RARE CHANGES OCCUR AND THESE CHANGES CAN BE INHERITED. MANY CHANGES IN DNA CAUSE FAULTS SOME ARE NEUTRAL OR EVEN ADVANTAGEOUS. THIS GIVES RISE TO GENETIC VARIATION WHICH IS THE SEED CORN OF EVOLUTION. SEXUAL REPRODUCTION BY THE CROSSING OVER OF CHROMOSOMES DURING MEIOSIS SPREADS VARIATION THROUGH THE POPULATION. OTHER EVENTS LIKE NATURAL SELECTION AND DRIFT REDUCE VARIATION. SO A POPULATION IN THE WILD ALWAYS HAS VARIATION BUT THE DETAILS ARE ALWAYS CHANGING.
EVOLUTION MAINLY WORKS BY NATURAL SELECTION. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN ANIMALS AND PLANTS WHICH ARE BEST SUITED TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT WILL ON AVERAGE SURVIVE BETTER. THERE IS A STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE. THOSE WHO SURVIVE WILL PRODUCE THE NEXT GENERATION. THEIR GENES WILL BE PASSED ON AND THE GENES OF THOSE WHO DID NOT REPRODUCE WILL NOT. THIS IS THE BASIC MECHANISM WHICH CHANGES A POPULATION AND CAUSES EVOLUTION.
NATURAL SELECTION EXPLAINS WHY LIVING ORGANISMS CHANGE OVER TIME TO HAVE THE ANATOMY THE FUNCTIONS AND BEHAVIOUR THAT THEY HAVE. IT WORKS LIKE THIS 
THERE ARE NOW MANY CASES WHERE NATURAL SELECTION HAS BEEN PROVED TO OCCUR IN WILD POPULATIONS. ALMOST EVERY CASE INVESTIGATED OF CAMOUFLAGE MIMICRY AND POLYMORPHISM HAS SHOWN STRONG EFFECTS OF SELECTION.
THE FORCE OF SELECTION CAN BE MUCH STRONGER THAN WAS THOUGHT BY THE EARLY POPULATION GENETICISTS. THE RESISTANCE TO PESTICIDES HAS GROWN QUICKLY. RESISTANCE TO WARFARIN IN NORWAY RATS RATTUS NORVEGICUS GREW RAPIDLY BECAUSE THOSE THAT SURVIVED MADE UP MORE AND MORE OF THE POPULATION. RESEARCH SHOWED THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF WARFARIN THE RESISTANT HOMOZYGOTE WAS AT A 54 DISADVANTAGE TO THE NORMAL WILD TYPE HOMOZYGOTE. THIS GREAT DISADVANTAGE WAS QUICKLY OVERCOME BY THE SELECTION FOR WARFARIN RESISTANCE.
MAMMALS NORMALLY CANNOT DRINK MILK AS ADULTS BUT HUMANS ARE AN EXCEPTION. MILK IS DIGESTED BY THE ENZYME LACTASE WHICH SWITCHES OFF AS MAMMALS STOP TAKING MILK FROM THEIR MOTHERS. THE HUMAN ABILITY TO DRINK MILK DURING ADULT LIFE IS SUPPORTED BY A LACTASE MUTATION WHICH PREVENTS THIS SWITCH OFF. HUMAN POPULATIONS HAVE A HIGH PROPORTION OF THIS MUTATION WHEREVER MILK IS IMPORTANT IN THE DIET. THE SPREAD OF THIS MILK TOLERANCE IS PROMOTED BY NATURAL SELECTION BECAUSE IT HELPS PEOPLE SURVIVE WHERE MILK IS AVAILABLE. GENETIC STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THE OLDEST MUTATIONS CAUSING LACTASE PERSISTENCE ONLY REACHED HIGH LEVELS IN HUMAN POPULATIONS IN THE LAST TEN THOUSAND YEARS. THEREFORE LACTASE PERSISTENCE IS OFTEN CITED AS AN EXAMPLE OF RECENT HUMAN EVOLUTION. AS LACTASE PERSISTENCE IS GENETIC BUT ANIMAL HUSBANDRY A CULTURAL TRAIT THIS IS GENE CULTURE COEVOLUTION.
ADAPTATION IS ONE OF THE BASIC PHENOMENA OF BIOLOGY. THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ADAPTATION AN ORGANISM BECOMES BETTER SUITED TO ITS HABITAT.
ADAPTATION IS ONE OF THE TWO MAIN PROCESSES THAT EXPLAIN THE DIVERSE SPECIES WE SEE IN BIOLOGY. THE OTHER IS SPECIATION SPECIES SPLITTING OR CLADOGENESIS. A FAVOURITE EXAMPLE USED TODAY TO STUDY THE INTERPLAY OF ADAPTATION AND SPECIATION IS THE EVOLUTION OF CICHLID FISH IN AFRICAN RIVERS AND LAKES.
WHEN PEOPLE SPEAK ABOUT ADAPTATION THEY OFTEN MEAN SOMETHING WHICH HELPS AN ANIMAL OR PLANT SURVIVE. ONE OF THE MOST WIDESPREAD ADAPTATIONS IN ANIMALS IS THE EVOLUTION OF THE EYE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE ADAPTATION OF HORSES TEETH TO GRINDING GRASS. CAMOUFLAGE IS ANOTHER ADAPTATION SO IS MIMICRY. THE BETTER ADAPTED ANIMALS ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO SURVIVE AND TO REPRODUCE SUCCESSFULLY NATURAL SELECTION.
AN INTERNAL PARASITE SUCH AS A FLUKE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE IT HAS A VERY SIMPLE BODILY STRUCTURE BUT STILL THE ORGANISM IS HIGHLY ADAPTED TO ITS PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT. FROM THIS WE SEE THAT ADAPTATION IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF VISIBLE TRAITS IN SUCH PARASITES CRITICAL ADAPTATIONS TAKE PLACE IN THE LIFE CYCLE WHICH IS OFTEN QUITE COMPLEX.
NOT ALL FEATURES OF AN ORGANISM ARE ADAPTATIONS. ADAPTATIONS TEND TO REFLECT THE PAST LIFE OF A SPECIES. IF A SPECIES HAS RECENTLY CHANGED ITS LIFE STYLE A ONCE VALUABLE ADAPTATION MAY BECOME USELESS AND EVENTUALLY BECOME A DWINDLING VESTIGE.
ADAPTATIONS ARE NEVER PERFECT. THERE ARE ALWAYS TRADEOFFS BETWEEN THE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS AND STRUCTURES IN A BODY. IT IS THE ORGANISM AS A WHOLE WHICH LIVES AND REPRODUCES THEREFORE IT IS THE COMPLETE SET OF ADAPTATIONS WHICH GETS PASSED ON TO FUTURE GENERATIONS.
IN POPULATIONS THERE ARE FORCES WHICH ADD VARIATION TO THE POPULATION SUCH AS MUTATION AND FORCES WHICH REMOVE IT. GENETIC DRIFT IS THE NAME GIVEN TO RANDOM CHANGES WHICH REMOVE VARIATION FROM A POPULATION. GENETIC DRIFT GETS RID OF VARIATION AT THE RATE OF 1 2N WHERE N POPULATION SIZE. IT IS THEREFORE A VERY WEAK EVOLUTIONARY FORCE IN LARGE POPULATIONS.
GENETIC DRIFT EXPLAINS HOW RANDOM CHANCE CAN AFFECT EVOLUTION IN SURPRISINGLY BIG WAYS BUT ONLY WHEN POPULATIONS ARE QUITE SMALL. OVERALL ITS ACTION IS TO MAKE THE INDIVIDUALS MORE SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER AND HENCE MORE VULNERABLE TO DISEASE OR TO CHANCE EVENTS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT.
HOW SPECIES FORM IS A MAJOR PART OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY. DARWIN INTERPRETED EVOLUTION A WORD HE DID NOT USE AT FIRST AS BEING ABOUT SPECIATION. THAT IS WHY HE CALLED HIS FAMOUS BOOK ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
DARWIN THOUGHT MOST SPECIES AROSE DIRECTLY FROM PRE EXISTING SPECIES. THIS IS CALLED ANAGENESIS NEW SPECIES BY OLDER SPECIES CHANGING. NOW WE THINK MOST SPECIES ARISE BY PREVIOUS SPECIES SPLITTING CLADOGENESIS.
TWO GROUPS THAT START THE SAME CAN ALSO BECOME VERY DIFFERENT IF THEY LIVE IN DIFFERENT PLACES. WHEN A SPECIES GETS SPLIT INTO TWO GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS A PROCESS STARTS. EACH ADAPTS TO ITS OWN SITUATION. AFTER A WHILE INDIVIDUALS FROM ONE GROUP CAN NO LONGER REPRODUCE WITH THE OTHER GROUP. TWO GOOD SPECIES HAVE EVOLVED FROM ONE.
A GERMAN EXPLORER MORITZ WAGNER DURING HIS THREE YEARS IN ALGERIA IN THE 1830S STUDIED FLIGHTLESS BEETLES. EACH SPECIES IS CONFINED TO A STRETCH OF THE NORTH COAST BETWEEN RIVERS WHICH DESCEND FROM THE ATLAS MOUNTAINS TO THE MEDITERRANEAN. AS SOON AS ONE CROSSES A RIVER A DIFFERENT BUT CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES APPEARS. HE WROTE LATER 
THIS WAS AN EARLY ACCOUNT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL SEPARATION. ANOTHER BIOLOGIST WHO THOUGHT GEOGRAPHICAL SEPARATION WAS CRITICAL WAS ERNST MAYR.
ONE EXAMPLE OF NATURAL SPECIATION IS THE THREE SPINED STICKLEBACK A SEA FISH THAT AFTER THE LAST ICE AGE INVADED FRESHWATER AND SET UP COLONIES IN ISOLATED LAKES AND STREAMS. OVER ABOUT 10 000 GENERATIONS THE STICKLEBACKS SHOW GREAT DIFFERENCES INCLUDING VARIATIONS IN FINS CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF THEIR BONY PLATES VARIABLE JAW STRUCTURE AND COLOR DIFFERENCES.
THE WOMBATS OF AUSTRALIA FALL INTO TWO MAIN GROUPS COMMON WOMBATS AND HAIRY NOSED WOMBATS. THE TWO TYPES LOOK VERY SIMILAR APART FROM THE HAIRINESS OF THEIR NOSES. HOWEVER THEY ARE ADAPTED TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS. COMMON WOMBATS LIVE IN FORESTED AREAS AND EAT MOSTLY GREEN FOOD WITH LOTS OF MOISTURE. THEY OFTEN FEED IN THE DAYTIME. HAIRY NOSED WOMBATS LIVE ON HOT DRY PLAINS WHERE THEY EAT DRY GRASS WITH VERY LITTLE WATER OR GOODNESS IN IT. THEIR METABOLIC SYSTEM IS SLOW AND THEY SLEEP MOST OF THE DAY UNDERGROUND.
WHEN TWO GROUPS THAT STARTED THE SAME BECOME DIFFERENT ENOUGH THEN THEY BECOME TWO DIFFERENT SPECIES. PART OF THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION IS THAT ALL LIVING THINGS STARTED OFF THE SAME BUT THEN SPLIT OFF INTO DIFFERENT GROUPS OVER BILLIONS OF YEARS.
THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT MOVEMENT IN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY WHICH STARTED IN THE 1930S AND FINISHED IN THE 1950S. IT HAS BEEN UPDATED REGULARLY EVER SINCE.
THE SYNTHESIS EXPLAINS HOW THE IDEAS OF CHARLES DARWIN FIT WITH THE DISCOVERIES OF GREGOR MENDEL WHO FOUND OUT HOW WE INHERIT OUR GENES. THE MODERN SYNTHESIS BROUGHT DARWIN S IDEA UP TO DATE. IT BRIDGED THE GAP BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF BIOLOGISTS GENETICISTS NATURALISTS AND PALAEONTOLOGISTS.
WHEN THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION WAS DEVELOPED IT WAS NOT CLEAR THAT NATURAL SELECTION AND GENETICS WORKED TOGETHER. BUT RONALD FISHER SHOWED THAT NATURAL SELECTION WOULD WORK TO CHANGE SPECIES. SEWALL WRIGHT EXPLAINED GENETIC DRIFT IN 1931.
CO EVOLUTION IS WHERE THE EXISTENCE OF ONE SPECIES IS TIGHTLY BOUND UP WITH THE LIFE OF ONE OR MORE OTHER SPECIES.
NEW OR IMPROVED ADAPTATIONS WHICH OCCUR IN ONE SPECIES ARE OFTEN FOLLOWED BY THE APPEARANCE AND SPREAD OF RELATED FEATURES IN THE OTHER SPECIES. THE LIFE AND DEATH OF LIVING THINGS IS INTIMATELY CONNECTED NOT JUST WITH THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT BUT WITH THE LIFE OF OTHER SPECIES.
THESE RELATIONSHIPS MAY CONTINUE FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS AS IT HAS IN THE POLLINATION OF FLOWERING PLANTS BY INSECTS. THE GUT CONTENTS WING STRUCTURES AND MOUTHPARTS OF FOSSILIZED BEETLES AND FLIES SUGGEST THAT THEY ACTED AS EARLY POLLINATORS. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BEETLES AND ANGIOSPERMS DURING THE LOWER CRETACEOUS PERIOD LED TO PARALLEL RADIATIONS OF ANGIOSPERMS AND INSECTS INTO THE LATE CRETACEOUS. THE EVOLUTION OF NECTARIES IN UPPER CRETACEOUS FLOWERS SIGNALS THE BEGINNING OF THE MUTUALISM BETWEEN HYMENOPTERA AND ANGIOSPERMS.
CHARLES DARWIN WAS THE FIRST TO USE THIS METAPHOR IN BIOLOGY. THE EVOLUTIONARY TREE SHOWS THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL GROUPS. IT INCLUDES DATA FROM DNA RNA AND PROTEIN ANALYSIS. TREE OF LIFE WORK IS A PRODUCT OF TRADITIONAL COMPARATIVE ANATOMY AND MODERN MOLECULAR EVOLUTION AND MOLECULAR CLOCK RESEARCH.
THE MAJOR FIGURE IN THIS WORK IS CARL WOESE WHO DEFINED THE ARCHAEA THE THIRD DOMAIN OR KINGDOM OF LIFE. BELOW IS A SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF PRESENT DAY UNDERSTANDING. 
MACROEVOLUTION THE STUDY OF CHANGES ABOVE THE SPECIES LEVEL AND HOW THEY TAKE PLACE. THE BASIC DATA FOR SUCH A STUDY ARE FOSSILS PALAEONTOLOGY AND THE RECONSTRUCTION OF ANCIENT ENVIRONMENTS. SOME SUBJECTS WHOSE STUDY FALLS WITHIN THE REALM OF MACROEVOLUTION 
IT IS A TERM OF CONVENIENCE FOR MOST BIOLOGISTS IT DOES NOT SUGGEST ANY CHANGE IN THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION. FOR SOME PALAEONTOLOGISTS WHAT THEY SEE IN THE FOSSIL RECORD CANNOT BE EXPLAINED JUST BY THE GRADUALIST EVOLUTIONARY SYNTHESIS. THEY ARE IN THE MINORITY.
ALTRUISM THE WILLINGNESS OF SOME TO SACRIFICE THEMSELVES FOR OTHERS IS WIDESPREAD IN SOCIAL ANIMALS. AS EXPLAINED ABOVE THE NEXT GENERATION CAN ONLY COME FROM THOSE WHO SURVIVE AND REPRODUCE. SOME BIOLOGISTS HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS MEANT ALTRUISM COULD NOT EVOLVE BY THE NORMAL PROCESS OF SELECTION. INSTEAD A PROCESS CALLED GROUP SELECTION WAS PROPOSED. GROUP SELECTION REFERS TO THE IDEA THAT ALLELES CAN BECOME FIXED OR SPREAD IN A POPULATION BECAUSE OF THE BENEFITS THEY BESTOW ON GROUPS REGARDLESS OF THE ALLELES EFFECT ON THE FITNESS OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THAT GROUP.
FOR SEVERAL DECADES CRITIQUES CAST SERIOUS DOUBT ON GROUP SELECTION AS A MAJOR MECHANISM OF EVOLUTION.
IN SIMPLE CASES IT CAN BE SEEN AT ONCE THAT TRADITIONAL SELECTION SUFFICES. FOR EXAMPLE IF ONE SIBLING SACRIFICES ITSELF FOR THREE SIBLINGS THE GENETIC DISPOSITION FOR THE ACT WILL BE INCREASED. THIS IS BECAUSE SIBLINGS SHARE ON AVERAGE 50 OF THEIR GENETIC INHERITANCE AND THE SACRIFICIAL ACT HAS LED TO GREATER REPRESENTATION OF THE GENES IN THE NEXT GENERATION.
ALTRUISM IS NOW GENERALLY SEEN AS EMERGING FROM STANDARD SELECTION. THE WARNING NOTE FROM ERNST MAYR AND THE WORK OF WILLIAM HAMILTON ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THIS DISCUSSION.
HAMILTON S EQUATION DESCRIBES WHETHER OR NOT A GENE FOR ALTRUISTIC BEHAVIOUR WILL SPREAD IN A POPULATION. THE GENE WILL SPREAD IF RXB IS GREATER THAN C 
WHERE 
AT FIRST SEXUAL REPRODUCTION MIGHT SEEM TO BE AT A DISADVANTAGE COMPARED WITH ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION. IN ORDER TO BE ADVANTAGEOUS SEXUAL REPRODUCTION CROSS FERTILISATION HAS TO OVERCOME A TWO FOLD DISADVANTAGE TAKES TWO TO REPRODUCE PLUS THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING A MATE. WHY THEN IS SEX SO NEARLY UNIVERSAL AMONG EUKARYOTES THIS IS ONE OF THE OLDEST QUESTIONS IN BIOLOGY.
THE ANSWER HAS BEEN GIVEN SINCE DARWIN S TIME BECAUSE THE SEXUAL POPULATIONS ADAPT BETTER TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES. A RECENT LABORATORY EXPERIMENT SUGGESTS THIS IS INDEED THE CORRECT EXPLANATION.
IN THE MAIN EXPERIMENT NEMATODE WORMS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. ONE GROUP WAS ENTIRELY OUTCROSSING THE OTHER WAS ENTIRELY SELFING. THE GROUPS WERE SUBJECTED TO A RUGGED TERRAIN AND REPEATEDLY SUBJECTED TO A MUTAGEN. AFTER 50 GENERATIONS THE SELFING POPULATION SHOWED A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN FITNESS SURVIVAL WHEREAS THE OUTCROSSING POPULATION SHOWED NO DECLINE. THIS IS ONE OF A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT SHOW SEXUALITY TO HAVE REAL ADVANTAGES OVER NON SEXUAL TYPES OF REPRODUCTION.
AN IMPORTANT ACTIVITY IS ARTIFICIAL SELECTION FOR DOMESTICATION. THIS IS WHEN PEOPLE CHOOSE WHICH ANIMALS TO BREED FROM BASED ON THEIR TRAITS. HUMANS HAVE USED THIS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO DOMESTICATE PLANTS AND ANIMALS.
MORE RECENTLY IT HAS BECOME POSSIBLE TO USE GENETIC ENGINEERING. NEW TECHNIQUES SUCH AS GENE TARGETING ARE NOW AVAILABLE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO INSERT NEW GENES OR KNOCK OUT OLD GENES FROM THE GENOME OF A PLANT OR ANIMAL. A NUMBER OF NOBEL PRIZES HAVE ALREADY BEEN AWARDED FOR THIS WORK.
HOWEVER THE REAL PURPOSE OF STUDYING EVOLUTION IS TO EXPLAIN AND HELP OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BIOLOGY. AFTER ALL IT IS THE FIRST GOOD EXPLANATION OF HOW LIVING THINGS CAME TO BE THE WAY THEY ARE. THAT IS A BIG ACHIEVEMENT. THE PRACTICAL THINGS COME MOSTLY FROM GENETICS THE SCIENCE STARTED BY GREGOR MENDEL AND FROM MOLECULAR AND CELL BIOLOGY.
IN 2010 THE JOURNAL NATURE SELECTED 15 TOPICS AS EVOLUTION GEMS. THESE WERE 
THE IDEA THAT ALL LIFE EVOLVED HAD BEEN PROPOSED BEFORE CHARLES DARWIN PUBLISHED ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. EVEN TODAY SOME PEOPLE STILL DISCUSS THE CONCEPT OF EVOLUTION AND WHAT IT MEANS TO THEM THEIR PHILOSOPHY AND THEIR RELIGION. EVOLUTION DOES EXPLAIN SOME THINGS ABOUT OUR HUMAN NATURE. PEOPLE ALSO TALK ABOUT THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF EVOLUTION FOR EXAMPLE IN SOCIOBIOLOGY.
SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE RELIGIOUS BELIEF THAT LIFE ON EARTH WAS CREATED BY A GOD. IN ORDER TO FIT IN THE IDEA OF EVOLUTION WITH THAT BELIEF PEOPLE HAVE USED IDEAS LIKE GUIDED EVOLUTION OR THEISTIC EVOLUTION. THEY SAY THAT EVOLUTION IS REAL BUT IS BEING GUIDED IN SOME WAY.
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT CONCEPTS OF THEISTIC EVOLUTION. MANY CREATIONISTS BELIEVE THAT THE CREATION MYTH FOUND IN THEIR RELIGION GOES AGAINST THE IDEA OF EVOLUTION. AS DARWIN REALISED THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL PART OF THE EVOLUTIONARY THOUGHT IS WHAT IT MEANS FOR HUMAN ORIGINS.
IN SOME COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES THERE IS TENSION BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ACCEPT THE IDEA OF EVOLUTION AND THOSE WHO DO NOT ACCEPT IT. THE DEBATE IS MOSTLY ABOUT WHETHER EVOLUTION SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS AND IN WHAT WAY THIS SHOULD BE DONE.
OTHER FIELDS LIKE COSMOLOGY AND EARTH SCIENCE ALSO DO NOT MATCH WITH THE ORIGINAL WRITINGS OF MANY RELIGIOUS TEXTS. THESE IDEAS WERE ONCE ALSO FIERCELY OPPOSED. DEATH FOR HERESY WAS THREATENED TO THOSE WHO WROTE AGAINST THE IDEA THAT EARTH WAS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE. 
EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY IS A MORE RECENT IDEA. CERTAIN RELIGIOUS GROUPS OPPOSE THE IDEA OF EVOLUTION MORE THAN OTHER RELIGIOUS GROUPS DO. FOR INSTANCE THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH NOW HAS THE FOLLOWING POSITION ON EVOLUTION POPE PIUS XII SAID IN HIS ENCYCLICAL HUMANI GENERIS PUBLISHED IN THE 1950S 
POPE JOHN PAUL II UPDATED THIS POSITION IN 1996. HE SAID THAT EVOLUTION WAS MORE THAN A HYPOTHESIS 
THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION ALSO DOES NOT OPPOSE THE SCIENTIFIC ACCOUNT OF EVOLUTION.
MANY OF THOSE WHO ACCEPTED EVOLUTION WERE NOT MUCH INTERESTED IN BIOLOGY. THEY WERE INTERESTED IN USING THE THEORY TO SUPPORT THEIR OWN IDEAS ON SOCIETY.
SOME PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO USE EVOLUTION TO SUPPORT RACISM. PEOPLE WANTING TO JUSTIFY RACISM CLAIMED THAT CERTAIN GROUPS SUCH AS BLACK PEOPLE WERE INFERIOR. IN NATURE SOME ANIMALS DO SURVIVE BETTER THAN OTHERS AND IT DOES LEAD TO ANIMALS BETTER ADAPTED TO THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. WITH HUMANS GROUPS FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD ALL EVOLUTION CAN SAY IS THAT EACH GROUP IS PROBABLY WELL SUITED TO ITS ORIGINAL SITUATION. EVOLUTION MAKES NO JUDGEMENTS ABOUT BETTER OR WORSE. IT DOES NOT SAY THAT ANY HUMAN GROUP IS SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER.
THIS AMAZING IDEA OF EUGENICS WAS RATHER DIFFERENT. TWO THINGS HAD BEEN NOTICED AS FAR BACK AS THE 18TH CENTURY. ONE WAS THE GREAT SUCCESS OF FARMERS IN BREEDING CATTLE AND CROP PLANTS. THEY DID THIS BY SELECTING WHICH ANIMALS OR PLANTS WOULD PRODUCE THE NEXT GENERATION ARTIFICIAL SELECTION. THE OTHER OBSERVATION WAS THAT LOWER CLASS PEOPLE HAD MORE CHILDREN THAN UPPER CLASS PEOPLE. IF AND IT S A BIG IF THE HIGHER CLASSES WERE THERE ON MERIT THEN THEIR LACK OF CHILDREN WAS THE EXACT REVERSE OF WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING. FASTER BREEDING IN THE LOWER CLASSES WOULD LEAD TO THE SOCIETY GETTING WORSE.
THE IDEA TO IMPROVE THE HUMAN SPECIES BY SELECTIVE BREEDING IS CALLED EUGENICS. THE NAME WAS PROPOSED BY FRANCIS GALTON A BRIGHT SCIENTIST WHO MEANT TO DO GOOD. HE SAID THAT THE HUMAN STOCK GENE POOL SHOULD BE IMPROVED BY SELECTIVE BREEDING POLICIES. THIS WOULD MEAN THAT THOSE WHO WERE CONSIDERED GOOD STOCK WOULD RECEIVE A REWARD IF THEY REPRODUCED. HOWEVER OTHER PEOPLE SUGGESTED THAT THOSE CONSIDERED BAD STOCK WOULD NEED TO UNDERGO COMPULSORY STERILIZATION PRENATAL TESTING AND BIRTH CONTROL. THE GERMAN NAZI GOVERNMENT 1933 1945 USED EUGENICS AS A COVER FOR THEIR EXTREME RACIAL POLICIES WITH DREADFUL RESULTS.
THE PROBLEM WITH GALTON S IDEA IS HOW TO DECIDE WHICH FEATURES TO SELECT. THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT SKILLS PEOPLE COULD HAVE YOU COULD NOT AGREE WHO WAS GOOD STOCK AND WHO WAS BAD STOCK. THERE WAS RATHER MORE AGREEMENT ON WHO SHOULD NOT BE BREEDING. SEVERAL COUNTRIES PASSED LAWS FOR THE COMPULSORY STERILISATION OF UNWELCOME GROUPS. MOST OF THESE LAWS WERE PASSED BETWEEN 1900 AND 1940. AFTER WORLD WAR II DISGUST AT WHAT THE NAZIS HAD DONE SQUASHED ANY MORE ATTEMPTS AT EUGENICS.
SOME EQUATIONS CAN BE SOLVED USING ALGORITHMS THAT SIMULATE EVOLUTION. EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS WORK LIKE THAT.
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF USING IDEAS ABOUT EVOLUTION TO SUPPORT SOCIAL ACTION IS SOCIAL DARWINISM. SOCIAL DARWINISM IS A TERM GIVEN TO THE IDEAS OF THE 19TH CENTURY SOCIAL PHILOSOPHER HERBERT SPENCER. SPENCER BELIEVED THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST COULD AND SHOULD BE APPLIED TO COMMERCE AND HUMAN SOCIETIES AS A WHOLE.
AGAIN SOME PEOPLE USED THESE IDEAS TO CLAIM THAT RACISM AND RUTHLESS ECONOMIC POLICIES WERE JUSTIFIED. TODAY MOST BIOLOGISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS SAY THAT THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO SOCIAL POLICY.
SOME PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH THE IDEA OF EVOLUTION. THEY DISAGREE WITH IT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. MOST OFTEN THESE REASONS ARE INFLUENCED BY OR BASED ON THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. PEOPLE WHO DO NOT AGREE WITH EVOLUTION USUALLY BELIEVE IN CREATIONISM OR INTELLIGENT DESIGN.
DESPITE THIS EVOLUTION IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THEORIES IN SCIENCE. PEOPLE HAVE DISCOVERED IT TO BE USEFUL FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF RESEARCH. NONE OF THE OTHER SUGGESTIONS EXPLAIN THINGS SUCH AS FOSSIL RECORDS AS WELL. SO FOR ALMOST ALL SCIENTISTS EVOLUTION IS NOT IN DOUBT.
THESE BOOKS ARE MOSTLY ABOUT THE EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION.
THESE BOOKS COVER MOST EVOLUTIONARY TOPICS.
FARMING
FARMING IS GROWING CROPS OR KEEPING ANIMALS BY PEOPLE FOR FOOD AND RAW MATERIALS. FARMING IS A PART OF AGRICULTURE.
AGRICULTURE STARTED THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO BUT NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE HOW OLD IT IS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF FARMING GAVE RISE TO THE NEOLITHIC REVOLUTION WHEREBY PEOPLE GAVE UP NOMADIC HUNTING AND BECAME SETTLERS IN WHAT BECAME CITIES.
AGRICULTURE AND DOMESTICATION PROBABLY STARTED IN THE FERTILE CRESCENT THE NILE VALLEY THE LEVANT AND MESOPOTAMIA. THE AREA CALLED FERTILE CRESCENT IS NOW IN THE COUNTRIES OF IRAQ SYRIA TURKEY JORDAN LEBANON ISRAEL AND EGYPT. WHEAT AND BARLEY ARE SOME OF THE FIRST CROPS PEOPLE GREW. PEOPLE PROBABLY STARTED AGRICULTURE SLOWLY BY PLANTING A FEW CROPS BUT STILL GATHERED MANY FOODS FROM THE WILD. PEOPLE MAY HAVE STARTED FARMING BECAUSE THE WEATHER AND SOIL BEGAN TO CHANGE. FARMING CAN FEED MANY MORE PEOPLE THAN HUNTER GATHERERS CAN FEED ON THE SAME AMOUNT OF LAND.
AGRICULTURE IS NOT ONLY GROWING FOOD FOR PEOPLE AND ANIMALS BUT ALSO GROWING OTHER THINGS LIKE FLOWERS AND NURSERY PLANTS MANURE OR DUNG ANIMAL HIDES SKINS OR FURS LEATHER ANIMALS FUNGI FIBERS COTTON WOOL HEMP AND FLAX BIOFUELS AND DRUGS BIOPHARMACEUTICALS MARIJUANA OPIUM.
MANY PEOPLE STILL LIVE BY SUBSISTENCE AGRICULTURE ON A SMALL FARM. THEY CAN ONLY GROW ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED THE FARMER HIS FAMILY AND HIS ANIMALS. THE YIELD IS THE AMOUNT OF FOOD GROWN ON A GIVEN AMOUNT OF LAND AND IT IS OFTEN LOW. THIS IS BECAUSE SUBSISTENCE FARMERS ARE GENERALLY LESS EDUCATED AND THEY HAVE LESS MONEY TO BUY EQUIPMENT. DROUGHT AND OTHER PROBLEMS SOMETIMES CAUSE FAMINES. WHERE YIELDS ARE LOW DEFORESTATION CAN PROVIDE NEW LAND TO GROW MORE FOOD. THIS PROVIDES MORE NUTRITION FOR THE FARMER S FAMILY BUT CAN BE BAD FOR THE COUNTRY AND THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT OVER MANY YEARS.
IN RICH COUNTRIES FARMS ARE OFTEN FEWER AND LARGER. DURING THE 20TH CENTURY THEY HAVE BECOME MORE PRODUCTIVE BECAUSE FARMERS ARE ABLE TO GROW BETTER VARIETIES OF PLANTS USE MORE FERTILIZER USE MORE WATER AND MORE EASILY CONTROL WEEDS AND PESTS. MANY FARMS ALSO USE MACHINES SO FEWER PEOPLE CAN FARM MORE LAND. THERE ARE FEWER FARMERS IN RICH COUNTRIES BUT THE FARMERS ARE ABLE TO GROW MORE. 
THIS KIND OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE COMES WITH ITS OWN SET OF PROBLEMS. FARMERS USE A LOT OF CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS PESTICIDES CHEMICALS THAT KILL BUGS AND HERBICIDES CHEMICALS THAT KILL WEEDS. THESE CHEMICALS CAN POLLUTE THE SOIL OR THE WATER. THEY CAN ALSO CREATE BUGS AND WEEDS THAT ARE MORE RESISTANT TO THE CHEMICALS CAUSING OUTBREAKS OF THESE PESTS. THE SOIL CAN BE DAMAGED BY EROSION BLOWING OR WASHING AWAY SALT BUILDUP OR LOSS OF STRUCTURE. IRRIGATION ADDING WATER FROM RIVERS CAN POLLUTE WATER AND LOWER THE WATER TABLE. THESE PROBLEMS HAVE ALL GOT SOLUTIONS AND MODERN YOUNG FARMERS USUALLY HAVE A GOOD TECHNICAL EDUCATION.
FARMERS SELECT PLANTS WITH BETTER YIELD TASTE AND NUTRITIONAL VALUE. THEY ALSO CHOOSE PLANTS THAT CAN SURVIVE PLANT DISEASE AND DROUGHT AND ARE EASIER TO HARVEST. CENTURIES OF ARTIFICIAL SELECTION AND BREEDING HAVE HAD ENORMOUS EFFECTS ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CROP PLANTS. THE CROPS PRODUCE BETTER YIELD WITH OTHER TECHNIQUES USE OF FERTILIZERS CHEMICAL PEST CONTROL IRRIGATION.
SOME COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR NEW PLANTS IN POOR COUNTRIES AND GENETICALLY MODIFY THESE PLANTS TO IMPROVE THEM. THEY THEN TRY TO PATENT THE SEEDS AND SELL THEM BACK TO THE POOR COUNTRIES.
NEW PLANTS WERE CREATED WITH GENETIC ENGINEERING. ONE EXAMPLE OF GENETIC ENGINEERING IS MODIFYING A PLANT TO RESIST A HERBICIDE.
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THERE TO BE ENOUGH FOOD FOR EVERYONE. THE FOOD MUST ALSO BE SAFE AND GOOD. PEOPLE SAY IT IS NOT ALWAYS SAFE BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SOME CHEMICALS. OTHER PEOPLE SAY INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE IS DAMAGING THE ENVIRONMENT. FOR THIS REASON THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES OF AGRICULTURE.
AGRICULTURAL POLICY FOCUSES ON THE GOALS AND METHODS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. AT THE POLICY LEVEL COMMON GOALS OF AGRICULTURE INCLUDE 
THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE FACE TRYING TO GROW FOOD TODAY.
THESE INCLUDE 
THE MAJOR CROPS PRODUCED IN THE WORLD IN 2002 ARE MAIZE CORN WHEAT RICE AND COTTON.

FINANCE
FINANCE IS A STUDY WHICH FIGURES OUT HOW PEOPLE BUSINESSES AND GROUPS MAKE AND USE MONEY. IT CAN MEAN 
THE PROCESS OF FINANCE IS LEARNING HOW PEOPLE AND GROUPS ACT IN MANAGING THEIR MONEY AND MOST OF ALL HOW THEY MANAGE MAKING MONEY AND MAKING A PROFIT WITH SPENDING MONEY OR MAKING A LOSS.
A GROUP THAT MAKES MORE MONEY THAN IT SPENDS CAN LEND OR INVEST THE EXCESS PROFIT. ON THE OTHER HAND A GROUP THAT MAKES LESS MONEY THAN IT SPENDS CAN RAISE MONEY BY GETTING A LOAN OR SELLING STOCK OR SPENDING LESS OR MAKING MORE MONEY. 
A BANK IS WHERE MANY PEOPLE BORROWING MONEY MEET PEOPLE LENDING MONEY. A BANK GETS MONEY FROM LENDERS AND PAYS INTEREST. THE BANK THEN LENDS THIS MONEY TO BORROWERS. BANKS ALLOW BORROWERS AND LENDERS OF DIFFERENT SIZES TO MEET. 
CORPORATE FINANCE IS ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE SALE OF STOCK BY A COMPANY TO THE PUBLIC. STOCK IS OWNERSHIP IN A COMPANY BROKEN UP INTO PIECES. THE STOCK GIVES WHOEVER OWNS IT PART OWNERSHIP IN THAT COMPANY. IF SOMEONE BUYS ONE SHARE OF XYZ INC AND THE COMPANY HAS 100 SHARES AVAILABLE THE BUYER IS 1 100TH OWNER OF THAT COMPANY AND OWNS 1 100TH 1 OF THE PROFIT. 
FINANCE IS USED BY PEOPLE BY GOVERNMENTS BY BUSINESSES ETC. AS WELL AS BY ALL KINDS OF GROUPS.
THIS IS FINANCE FOR PEOPLE. IT IS ABOUT 
BUSINESS FINANCE IS ABOUT FINDING MONEY FOR A COMPANY S ACTIVITIES. IT STUDIES TRYING TO MAKE MORE PROFIT THAN LOSS AND TAKING GOOD RISKS FOR THE CHANCE TO MAKE MORE MONEY.
FINANCIAL ECONOMICS IS THE STUDY OF ECONOMICS WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO FINANCIAL THINGS LIKE CHANGES IN PRICE AND SUPPLY OF GOODS. 
IT STUDIES HOW MUCH RISK SOME ACTIONS THAT A COMPANY MAY TAKE WILL CAUSE AND HOW THE COMPANY SHOULD SPEND ITS MONEY.
FINANCIAL MATHS IS THE STUDY OF MATHS FOR FINANCIAL MARKETS. FINANCIAL MATHS STUDIES MATHEMATICS MAINLY STATISTICS.
FIXED WING AIRCRAFT
A FIXED WING AIRCRAFT IS A KIND OF AIRCRAFT. AN AIRCRAFT IS A MACHINE THAT CAN FLY BUT IS HEAVIER THAN AIR. FIXED WING AIRCRAFT ARE SOMETIMES CALLED AIRPLANES AEROPLANES OR SOMETIMES JUST PLANES. ALL FIXED WING AIRCRAFT HAVE WINGS THAT USE FORWARD AIRSPEED TO GENERATE LIFT. GLIDERS ARE FIXED WING AIRCRAFT THAT DO NOT HAVE ENGINES.
A STEAM POWERED UNMANNED FIXED WING AIRCRAFT THAT WEIGHED 9 LBS. 4 KG WAS BUILT BY JOHN STRINGFELLOW IN CHARD SOMERSET ENGLAND IN 1848. IT COULD FLY BY ITSELF WITHOUT NEEDING TO BE DROPPED FROM HIGH UP. THERE WERE GLIDERS BEFORE THIS BUT THEY HAD TO FLY BY BEING PUSHED OFF A BUILDING OR HILL.
THE FIRST MAN WHO FLEW TOOK OFF STEERED AND LANDED A MOTOR POWERED AIRCRAFT WAS ORVILLE WRIGHT IN 1903 IN KITTY HAWK NORTH CAROLINA USA.
TODAY FIXED WING AIRCRAFT FLY BETWEEN MANY CITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD CARRYING PEOPLE AND CARGO. BIG CITIES USUALLY HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WHERE LARGE FIXED WING AIRCRAFT CAN LAND AND TAKE OFF SAFELY. SOME LARGE CITIES LIKE NEW YORK CITY AND LONDON HAVE MORE THAN ONE AIRPORT. TWO MAJOR MAKERS OF FIXED WING AIRCRAFT ARE AIRBUS AND BOEING.
ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY HAVE MADE FIXED WING AIRCRAFT MORE EFFICIENT. THINGS LIKE WINGLETS AND MORE EFFICIENT TURBOFANS HAVE HELPED TO DO THIS.
MOST FIXED WING AIRCRAFT HAVE CERTAIN PARTS IN COMMON.
FIXED WING AIRCRAFT HAVE LONG BEEN USED FOR MOVING PEOPLE FROM PLACE TO PLACE FOR THINGS LIKE HOLIDAYS. THEY ALSO CARRY CARGO OR BOXES ACROSS SEAS AND LONG DISTANCES TO OTHER COUNTRIES.
THE FIRST AIRCRAFT FOR WAR BOMBING WAS USED IN LIBYA IN 1911 BY ITALY AGAINST THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. SOME FIXED WING AIRCRAFT ARE USED BY AIR FORCES TO DEFEND COUNTRIES. THESE FIXED WING AIRCRAFT MAY BE FIGHTERS USING GUNS OR MISSILES FOR COMBAT WITH OTHER AIRCRAFT OR THEY MAY BE BOMBERS DROPPING BOMBS ON GROUND TARGETS.
FIXED WING AIRCRAFT ALLOW PEOPLE TO TRAVEL LONGER DISTANCES AND FASTER THAN SHIPS OR TRAINS. AIRCRAFT CAN FLY FROM NEW YORK TO LONDON IN ABOUT 7 HOURS. IT WOULD TAKE ONE WEEK OR MORE ON A SHIP.
AIRPLANES ARE ALSO USED BY THE MILITARY TO SEE MANY THINGS ON THE GROUND EASILY. THIS IS CALLED SURVEILLANCE OR RECONNAISSANCE. OFTEN FIXED WING AIRCRAFT WILL TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AS WELL WHICH CAN BE USED FOR MILITARY PLANNING LATER.
STATISTICS SHOW THAT RIDING IN A PLANE IS SAFER THAN DRIVING IN A CAR.
FLOWER
A FLOWER IS A SPECIAL KIND OF PLANT PART. FLOWERS ARE ALSO CALLED THE BLOOM OR BLOSSOM OF A PLANT. THE FLOWER GROWS ON A STALK A THIN NODE WHICH SUPPORTS IT. FLOWERS HAVE PETALS. INSIDE THE PART OF THE FLOWER THAT HAS PETALS ARE THE PARTS WHICH PRODUCE POLLEN AND SEEDS.
FLOWERS ARE THE REPRODUCTIVE STRUCTURE OF FLOWERING PLANTS WHICH ARE PLANTS OF THE DIVISION MAGNOLIOPHYTA ALSO CALLED THE ANGIOSPERMS.
IN MANY PLANTS A FLOWER IS ITS MOST COLOURFUL PART. WE SAY THE PLANT FLOWERS IS FLOWERING OR IS IN FLOWER WHEN THIS COLOURFUL PART BEGINS TO GROW BIGGER AND OPEN OUT. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FLOWERS IN DIFFERENT AREAS IN THE WORLD. EVEN IN THE COLDEST PLACES FOR EXAMPLE THE ARCTIC FLOWERS CAN GROW DURING A FEW MONTHS.
FLOWERS MAY GROW SEPARATELY ON THE PLANT OR THEY MAY GROW TOGETHER IN AN INFLORESCENCE.
TO INVESTIGATE THE STRUCTURE OF A FLOWER IT MUST BE DISSECTED AND ITS STRUCTURE SUMMARISED BY A FLORAL DIAGRAM OR A FLORAL FORMULA. THEN ITS FAMILY CAN BE IDENTIFIED WITH THE AID OF A FLORA WHICH IS A BOOK DESIGNED TO HELP YOU IDENTIFY PLANTS.
FLOWERS HAVE FOUR BASIC PARTS FROM THE OUTSIDE IN THEY ARE 
ALTHOUGH THIS ARRANGEMENT IS TYPICAL PLANT SPECIES SHOW A WIDE VARIATION IN FLORAL STRUCTURE. THE MODIFICATIONS PRODUCED IN THE EVOLUTION OF FLOWERING PLANTS ARE USED BY BOTANISTS TO FIND RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PLANT SPECIES. 
FLOWERS ARE AN IMPORTANT EVOLUTIONARY ADVANCE MADE BY FLOWERING PLANTS. SOME FLOWERS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE WIND TO MOVE POLLEN BETWEEN FLOWERS OF THE SAME SPECIES. MANY OTHERS RELY ON INSECTS OR BIRDS TO MOVE POLLEN. THE ROLE OF FLOWERS IS TO PRODUCE SEEDS WHICH ARE CONTAINED IN FRUIT. FRUITS AND SEEDS ARE A MEANS OF DISPERSAL. PLANTS DO NOT MOVE BUT WIND ANIMALS AND BIRDS SPREAD THE PLANTS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE.
SINCE THE OVULES ARE PROTECTED BY CARPELS IT TAKES SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR FERTILISATION TO HAPPEN. ANGIOSPERMS HAVE POLLEN GRAINS COMPRISING JUST THREE CELLS. ONE CELL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DRILLING DOWN THROUGH THE INTEGUMENTS AND CREATING A PASSAGE FOR THE TWO SPERM CELLS TO FLOW DOWN. THE MEGAGAMETOPHYTE HAS JUST SEVEN CELLS. OF THESE ONE IS THE EGG CELL IT FUSES WITH A SPERM CELL FORMING THE ZYGOTE. ANOTHER CELL JOINS WITH THE OTHER SPERM AND DEDICATES ITSELF TO FORMING A NUTRIENT RICH ENDOSPERM. THE OTHER CELLS TAKE AUXILIARY ROLES. THIS PROCESS OF DOUBLE FERTILISATION IS UNIQUE AND COMMON TO ALL ANGIOSPERMS.
FLOWERS ARE MODIFIED LEAVES POSSESSED ONLY BY THE FLOWERING PLANTS ANGIOSPERMS WHICH ARE RELATIVELY LATE TO APPEAR IN THE FOSSIL RECORD.
THE EARLIEST KNOWN FOSSILS OF FLOWERS AND FLOWERING PLANTS ARE FROM 130 MILLION YEARS AGO IN THE LOWER CRETACEOUS.
THE FLOWERING PLANTS HAVE LONG BEEN ASSUMED TO HAVE EVOLVED FROM WITHIN THE GYMNOSPERMS BUT THE KNOWN GYMNOSPERMS FORM A CLADE WHICH IS DISTINCT FROM THE ANGIOSPERMS. IT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED THAT THE TWO CLADES DIVERGED SPLIT SOME 300 MILLION YEARS AGO.
FLOWERS HAVE LONG BEEN ADMIRED AND USED BY HUMANS. MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT FLOWERS ARE BEAUTIFUL. MANY PEOPLE ALSO LOVE FLOWERS FOR THEIR FRAGRANCES SCENTS. PEOPLE ENJOY SEEING FLOWERS GROWING IN GARDENS. PEOPLE ALSO ENJOY GROWING FLOWERS IN THEIR BACKYARDS OUTSIDE THEIR HOMES. PEOPLE OFTEN WEAR FLOWERS ON THEIR CLOTHES OR GIVE FLOWERS AS A GIFT DURING SPECIAL OCCASIONS HOLIDAYS OR RITUALS SUCH AS THE BIRTH OF A NEW BABY OR A CHRISTENING AT WEDDINGS MARRIAGES AT FUNERALS WHEN A PERSON DIES. PEOPLE OFTEN BUY FLOWERS FROM BUSINESSES CALLED FLORISTS.
SOME PARENTS NAME THEIR GIRL CHILDREN AFTER A FLOWER. SOME COMMON FLOWER NAMES ARE ROSE LILY DAISY HOLLY HYACINTH JASMINE BLOSSOM.
PEOPLE ALSO EAT SOME TYPES OF FLOWERS. FLOWER VEGETABLES INCLUDE BROCCOLI CAULIFLOWER AND ARTICHOKE. THE MOST EXPENSIVE SPICE SAFFRON COMES FROM THE CROCUS FLOWER. OTHER FLOWER SPICES ARE CLOVES AND CAPERS. HOPS FLOWERS ARE USED TO FLAVOR BEER. DANDELION CAN BE MADE INTO WINE.
HONEY IS FLOWER NECTAR THAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED AND PROCESSED BY BEES. HONEY IS OFTEN NAMED FOR THE TYPE OF FLOWER THAT THE BEES ARE USING FOR EXAMPLE CLOVER HONEY. SOME PEOPLE PUT FLOWERS FROM NASTURTIUMS CHRYSANTHEMUMS OR CARNATIONS IN THEIR FOOD. FLOWERS CAN ALSO BE MADE INTO TEA. DRIED FLOWERS SUCH AS CHRYSANTHEMUM ROSE AND JASMINE ARE USED TO MAKE TEA.
FLOWERS WERE USED TO SIGNAL MEANINGS IN THE TIME WHEN SOCIAL MEETINGS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WAS DIFFICULT. LILIES MADE PEOPLE THINK OF LIFE. RED ROSES MADE PEOPLE THINK OF LOVE BEAUTY AND PASSION. IN BRITAIN AUSTRALIA AND CANADA POPPIES ARE WORN ON SPECIAL HOLIDAYS AS A MARK OF RESPECT FOR THOSE WHO SERVED AND DIED IN WARS. DAISIES MADE PEOPLE THINK OF CHILDREN AND INNOCENCE.
FOSSIL
A FOSSIL IS THE REMAINS OR TRACE OF AN ANCIENT LIVING THING.
FOSSILS OF ANIMALS PLANTS OR PROTISTS OCCUR IN SEDIMENTARY ROCK. 
IN A TYPICAL FOSSIL THE BODY FORM IS RETAINED BUT THE ORIGINAL MOLECULES THAT MADE UP THE BODY HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY SOME INORGANIC MATERIAL SUCH AS CALCIUM CARBONATE CACO OR SILICA SIO. THE FOSSIL FEELS LIKE AND IS MADE OF ROCK. IT HAS BEEN MINERALISED OR PETRIFIED LITERALLY TURNED INTO ROCK. 
A FOSSIL MAY ALSO BE AN IMPRINT OR IMPRESSION OF A LIVING THING REMAINING IN THE FOSSILISED MUD OF A LONG GONE AGE. 
SOME ORGANISMS FOSSILISE WELL OTHERS DO NOT. THE MOST COMMON FOSSILS ARE THOSE LEFT BEHIND BY ORGANISMS THAT PRODUCE HARD MATERIALS. THE HARD CALCITIC SHELLS OF MOLLUSCS SUCH AS CLAMS AND SNAILS AND OF NOW RARE BRACHIOPODS ALSO KNOWN AS LAMPSHELLS ARE EXAMPLES. THESE SEA DWELLING SHELLFISH HAVE PRODUCED MANY FOSSILIFEROUS THAT IS FOSSIL BEARING CHALKY LAYERS OF LIMESTONE IN THE EARTH. 
SOFT BODIED ORGANISMS CAN FOSSILISE IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE EDIACARAN BIOTA IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. 
THE BEST KNOWN FOSSILS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC ARE THOSE OF THE GIANT PREHISTORIC DINOSAURS. THE FOSSILIZED BONES AND FOSSILIZED TRACKS OF THESE HUGE ANCIENT REPTILES CAN BE SEEN IN MANY MUSEUMS OF NATURAL HISTORY AND EARTH SCIENCE. 
THE STUDY OF FOSSILS BY GEOLOGISTS AND BIOLOGISTS IS KNOWN AS PALEONTOLOGY. IF THE STUDY PUTS LIVING THINGS IN THEIR ECOLOGICAL CONTEXT IT IS CALLED PALEOBIOLOGY.
THERE ARE SOME SITES WHERE FOSSILS HAVE BEEN FOUND WITH REMARKABLE DETAILS OR IN LARGE NUMBERS. PALAEONTOLOGISTS CALL THESE SITES BY THE GERMAN TERM LAGERST TTEN. THE LA BREA TAR PITS IN LOS ANGELES IS SUCH A PLACE. SO ARE THE SOLNHOFEN LIMESTONE QUARRIES IN BAVARIA.
MICROSCOPIC OR VERY TINY FOSSILS ARE CALLED MICROFOSSILS WHILE LARGER MACROSCOPIC FOSSILS SUCH AS THOSE OF SEASHELLS AND MAMMALS ARE CALLED MACROFOSSILS. NATURAL STONES WHICH LOOK LIKE FOSSILIZED ORGANISMS BUT ARE NOT FOSSILS AT ALL ARE CALLED PSEUDOFOSSILS. 
ALTHOUGH MOST FOSSILS ARE FORMED FROM THE HARD PARTS OF ORGANISMS THERE ARE ALSO INDIRECT SIGNS OF PREHISTORIC LIFE. EXAMPLES SUCH AS A WORM S TRAIL OR AN ANIMAL S FOOTPRINT ARE QUITE COMMON. THEY ARE KNOWN AS TRACE FOSSILS. FOSSILIZED EXCREMENT FAECES OR DUNG IS KNOWN AS A COPROLITE. CHEMICAL TRACES OF PREHISTORIC ORGANISMS IS CALLED A CHEMOFOSSIL. OBJECTS MADE BY PREHISTORIC PEOPLE ARE CALLED ARTIFACTS.
EVEN WHEN THE REMAINS OF SOFT BODIED ANIMALS ARE GONE THERE MAY BE IMPRESSIONS MOLDS OR CARBON TRACES WHICH REMAIN PERMANENTLY. SO IN SPECIAL CASES WE DO HAVE FOSSILS EVEN OF SMALL SOFT INVERTEBRATE ANIMALS. 
SOMETIMES A FOSSIL IS PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF DRYNESS DESICCATION FREEZING OR PINE RESIN. MUMMIFIED ANIMALS ICE COVERED WOOLY MAMMOTHS AND INSECT FILLED AMBER ARE EXAMPLES OF SUCH FOSSILS.
LIVING FOSSILS HOWEVER ARE NOT FOSSILS AT ALL. INSTEAD THEY ARE MODERN DAY ORGANISMS WHICH VERY CLOSELY RESEMBLE THEIR PREHISTORIC ANCESTORS OF MANY MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO. THE GINKGO TREE THE COELACANTH AND THE HORSESHOE CRAB ARE GOOD EXAMPLES.
MANY PRE SCIENTIFIC PEOPLES NOTICED FOSSILS BUT NOT ALL THOUGHT THEY WERE THE REMAINS OF LIVING THINGS. PERHAPS THE FIRST TO LEAVE A RECORD OF HIS THOUGHT WAS THE ANCIENT GREEK PHILOSOPHER XENOPHANES ABOUT 570 470. HIS IDEAS WERE REPORTED BY LATER WRITERS 
THESE IDEAS WERE REDISCOVERED IN THE 17TH CENTURY IN EUROPE. NICOLAS STENO IN THE NETHERLANDS AND ROBERT HOOKE AT THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN LONDON BOTH WROTE AND GAVE LECTURES ABOUT FOSSILS. IN THE 18TH CENTURY FOSSIL COLLECTING BEGAN AND SERIOUS THINKING ON GEOLOGY BEGAN TO MAKE PROGRESS. IN THE 19TH CENTURY GEOLOGY BECAME A MODERN SCIENCE AND FOSSILS PLAYED A PART IN THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION.
FRENCH REVOLUTION
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION WAS A REVOLUTION IN FRANCE FROM 1789 TO 1799. IT LED TO THE END OF THE MONARCHY AND TO MANY WARS. KING LOUIS XVI WAS EXECUTED IN 1793. THE REVOLUTION ENDED WHEN NAPOLEON BONAPARTE TOOK POWER IN NOVEMBER 1799. IN 1804 HE BECAME EMPEROR.
BEFORE 1789 FRANCE WAS RULED BY THE NOBLES AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THE IDEAS OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT WERE BEGINNING TO MAKE THE ORDINARY PEOPLE WANT MORE POWER. THEY COULD SEE THAT THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION HAD CREATED A COUNTRY IN WHICH THE PEOPLE HAD POWER INSTEAD OF A KING. THE GOVERNMENT BEFORE THE REVOLUTION WAS CALLED THE ANCIEN OLD REGIME.
MANY PROBLEMS IN FRANCE LED UP TO THE REVOLUTION 
BEFORE THE REVOLUTION FRANCE WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE ESTATES. THE FIRST ESTATE WAS THE CLERGY THE CHURCH. IT MADE UP 1 OF THE POPULATION. THE SECOND ESTATE WAS THE NOBLES WHICH ALSO MADE UP 1 OF THE POPULATION. THE OTHER NEARLY 98 OF THE POPULATION WAS IN THE THIRD ESTATE. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE FROM ALL THREE ESTATES TOGETHER MADE UP THE ESTATES GENERAL. 
IN MAY 1789 THE ESTATES GENERAL WAS CALLED BY THE KING IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE MONEY PROBLEMS OF THE COUNTRY. THEY MET AT THE ROYAL PALACE OF VERSAILLES. HOWEVER THE MEMBERS OF THE THIRD ESTATE WERE ANGRY. THEY HAD MADE LISTS OF PROBLEMS THEY WANTED TO FIX CALLED THE CAHIERS DE DOL ANCES.
THE MEMBERS OF THE THIRD ESTATE THE COMMONERS WERE ANGRY THAT THEY WERE BEING TAXED THE MOST WHEN THEY WERE THE POOREST GROUP OF PEOPLE. THEY AND THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF FINANCES JACQUES NECKER THOUGHT THE CHURCH AND THE NOBILITY OUGHT TO BE TAXED MORE.
THEY ALSO WANTED VOTES IN THE ESTATES GENERAL TO BE MORE FAIR. EVEN THOUGH THE THIRD ESTATE HAD MANY MORE MEMBERS THAN THE OTHER TWO ESTATES EACH ESTATE ONLY HAD ONE VOTE IN THE ESTATES GENERAL. THE THIRD ESTATE THOUGHT THIS COULD BE IMPROVED BY GIVING MEMBERS OF THE ESTATES GENERAL A VOTE EACH. HOWEVER WHEN THEY TALKED TO THE OTHER ESTATES THEY COULD NOT AGREE.
SINCE THE FIRST AND SECOND ESTATES WOULD NOT LISTEN THE THIRD ESTATE DECIDED TO BREAK AWAY AND START THEIR OWN ASSEMBLY WHERE EVERY MEMBER WOULD GET A VOTE. ON 10 JUNE 1789 THEY STARTED THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. THE KING TRIED TO STOP THEM BY CLOSING THE SALLE DES TATS MEETING ROOM BUT THEY MET IN AN INDOOR TENNIS COURT INSTEAD. ON JUNE 20TH THEY TOOK THE TENNIS COURT OATH WHERE THEY PROMISED TO WORK UNTIL THEY HAD CREATED A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR FRANCE.
IN JULY 1789 AFTER THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WAS FORMED THE NOBILITY AND THE KING WERE ANGRY WITH JACQUES NECKER THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF FINANCES AND THEY FIRED HIM. MANY PARISIANS THOUGHT THE KING WAS GOING TO TRY TO SHUT DOWN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. SOON PARIS WAS FILLED WITH RIOTS AND LOOTING.
ON 14 JULY 1789 THE PEOPLE DECIDED TO ATTACK THE BASTILLE PRISON. THE BASTILLE CONTAINED WEAPONS AS WELL AS BEING A SYMBOL OF THE POWER OF THE NOBILITY AND THE RULE OF THE KING THE ANCIEN R GIME. BY THE AFTERNOON THE PEOPLE HAD BROKEN INTO THE BASTILLE AND RELEASED THE SEVEN PRISONERS BEING HELD THERE. THEY KILLED THE GOVERNOR OF THE PRISON BERNARD DE LAUNAY AND PUT HIS HEAD ON A STICK.
THE MEMBERS OF THE THIRD ESTATE TOOK OVER PARIS. THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AT THE TIME OF THE TENNIS COURT OATH JEAN SYLVAIN BAILLY BECAME MAYOR OF THE CITY. JACQUES NECKER WAS GIVEN BACK HIS JOB AS DIRECTOR GENERAL OF FINANCES. SOON THE KING VISITED PARIS AND WORE THE RED WHITE AND BLUE TRICOLOR RIBBONS COCKADE THAT THE REVOLUTIONARIES WERE WEARING. BY THE END OF JULY THE REVOLUTION HAD SPREAD ALL OVER FRANCE.
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BEGAN TO MAKE LOTS OF CHANGES. ON 4 AUGUST THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ENDED THE SPECIAL TAXES THE CHURCH WAS COLLECTING AND PUT A STOP TO THE RIGHTS OF THE NOBILITY OVER THEIR PEOPLE ENDING FEUDALISM. ON 26 AUGUST THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PUBLISHED THE DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN AND OF THE CITIZEN WHICH WAS WRITTEN BY THE NOBLEMAN MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE.
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BEGAN TO DECIDE HOW IT WOULD BE UNDER THE NEW CONSTITUTION. MANY MEMBERS ESPECIALLY THE NOBLES WANTED A SENATE OR A SECOND UPPER HOUSE. HOWEVER MORE PEOPLE VOTED TO KEEP HAVING JUST ONE ASSEMBLY. THE KING WAS GIVEN A SUSPENSIVE VETO OVER LAWS WHICH MEANT HE WOULD ONLY HAVE THE POWER TO DELAY LAWS BEING MADE NOT STOP THEM. IN OCTOBER 1789 AFTER BEING ATTACKED AT THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES BY A MOB OF 7 000 WOMEN THE KING WAS CONVINCED BY LAFAYETTE TO MOVE FROM PARIS TO THE PALACE IN TUILERIES.
THE ASSEMBLY BEGAN TO DIVIDE INTO DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES. ONE WAS MADE UP OF THOSE AGAINST THE REVOLUTION LED BY THE NOBLEMAN JACQUES ANTOINE MARIE DE CAZALES AND THE CHURCHMAN JEAN SIFRIEN MAURY. THIS PARTY SAT ON THE RIGHT SIDE. A SECOND PARTY WAS THE ROYALIST DEMOCRATS MONARCHISTS WHICH WANTED TO CREATE A SYSTEM LIKE THE CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY OF BRITAIN WHERE THE KING WOULD STILL BE A PART OF THE GOVERNMENT. JACQUES NECKER WAS IN THIS PARTY. THE THIRD PARTY WAS THE NATIONAL PARTY WHICH WAS CENTRE OR CENTRE LEFT. THIS INCLUDED HONOR MIRABEAU AND LAFAYETTE.
UNDER THE NEW GOVERNMENT THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH WOULD HAVE MUCH LESS POWER THAN THEY HAD BEFORE. IN 1790 ALL SPECIAL TAXES AND POWERS OF THE CHURCH WERE CANCELLED. ALL THE CHURCH S PROPERTY WAS TAKEN OVER BY THE STATE. ON 12 JULY 1790 THE CIVIL CONSTITUTION OF THE CLERGY MADE ALL CLERGY EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE AND MADE THEM TAKE AN OATH TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION. MANY CLERGY AS WELL AS THE POPE PIUS VI DID NOT LIKE THESE CHANGES. REVOLUTIONARIES KILLED HUNDREDS FOR REFUSING THE OATH.
ON 14 JULY 1790 A YEAR SINCE THE STORMING OF THE BASTILLE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE GATHERED IN THE CHAMPS DE MARS TO CELEBRATE. CHARLES MAURICE DE TALLEYRAND LED THE CROWD IN A RELIGIOUS MASS. THE CROWD INCLUDING THE KING AND THE ROYAL FAMILY TOOK AN OATH OF LOYALTY TO THE NATION THE LAW AND THE KING. HOWEVER MANY NOBLES WERE UNHAPPY WITH THE REVOLUTION AND WERE LEAVING THE COUNTRY. THEY WERE CALLED MIGR S EMIGRANTS.
ALTHOUGH THE MEMBERS OF THE ESTATES GENERAL HAD ONLY BEEN ELECTED FOR A YEAR THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HAD ALL TAKEN THE TENNIS COURT OATH. THEY HAD PROMISED TO KEEP WORKING UNTIL THEY HAD A CONSTITUTION AND NO CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN MADE. IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE MEMBERS WOULD KEEP WORKING UNTIL THEY HAD A CONSTITUTION.
THE ASSEMBLY CONTINUED TO WORK ON A CONSTITUTION AND MAKE CHANGES. NOBLES COULD NO LONGER PASS THEIR TITLES TO THEIR CHILDREN. ONLY THE KING WAS ALLOWED TO DO THIS. FOR THE FIRST TIME TRIALS WITH JURIES WERE HELD. ALL TRADE BARRIERS INSIDE FRANCE WERE ENDED ALONG WITH UNIONS GUILDS AND WORKERS GROUPS. STRIKES WERE BANNED.
MANY PEOPLE WITH RADICAL IDEAS BEGAN TO FORM POLITICAL CLUBS. THE MOST FAMOUS OF THESE WAS THE JACOBIN CLUB WHICH HAD LEFT WING IDEAS. A RIGHT WING CLUB WAS THE CLUB MONARCHIQUE. IN 1791 A LAW WAS SUGGESTED TO PREVENT NOBLE MIGR S FROM LEAVING THE COUNTRY. MIRABEAU HAD BEEN AGAINST THIS LAW BUT HE DIED ON 2 APRIL AND BY THE END OF THE YEAR THE LAW WAS PASSED.
LOUIS XVI DID NOT LIKE THE REVOLUTION BUT DID NOT WANT TO GET HELP FROM OTHER COUNTRIES OR RUN AWAY FROM FRANCE LIKE THE MIGR S. GENERAL BOUILLE HELD THE SAME VIEWS AND WANTED TO HELP THE KING LEAVE PARIS. HE SAID THAT HE WOULD GIVE THE KING AND HIS FAMILY HELP AND SUPPORT IN HIS CAMP AT MONTM DY. THE ESCAPE WAS PLANNED FOR JUNE 20 1791.
DRESSED AS SERVANTS THE ROYAL FAMILY LEFT PARIS. HOWEVER THEIR ESCAPE WAS NOT WELL PLANNED AND THEY WERE ARRESTED AT VARENNES ON THE EVENING OF JUNE 21. THE ROYAL FAMILY WAS BROUGHT BACK TO PARIS. THE ASSEMBLY IMPRISONED LOUIS AND HIS WIFE MARIE ANTOINETTE AND SUSPENDED THE KING FROM HIS DUTY.
ALTHOUGH THE KING HAD TRIED TO ESCAPE MOST MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY STILL WANTED TO INCLUDE THE KING IN THEIR GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN TO HAVE A REPUBLIC WITH NO KING AT ALL. THEY AGREED TO MAKE THE KING A FIGUREHEAD WITH VERY LITTLE POWER. THE KING WOULD HAVE TO TAKE AN OATH TO THE STATE. IF HE DID NOT OR IF HE CREATED AN ARMY TO ATTACK FRANCE HE WOULD NO LONGER BE KING.
SOME PEOPLE INCLUDING JACQUES PIERRE BRISSOT DID NOT LIKE THIS. THEY THOUGHT THE KING SHOULD BE COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM THE THRONE AND THE CONSTITUTION. BRISSOT MADE A PETITION AND A HUGE CROWD CAME TO THE CHAMPS DE MARS TO SIGN IT. REPUBLICAN LEADERS GEORGES DANTON AND CAMILLE DESMOULINS CAME AND GAVE SPEECHES.
THE NATIONAL GUARD LED BY LAFAYETTE WAS CALLED IN TO CONTROL THE CROWD. THE MOB THREW STONES AT THE SOLDIERS WHO FIRST FIRED THEIR GUNS OVER THE HEADS OF THE CROWD. WHEN THE CROWD KEPT THROWING STONES LAFAYETTE ORDERED THEM TO FIRE AT THE PEOPLE. UP TO 50 PEOPLE WERE KILLED. AFTER THIS THE GOVERNMENT CLOSED MANY OF THE POLITICAL CLUBS AND NEWSPAPERS. MANY RADICAL LEFT WING LEADERS INCLUDING DANTON AND DESMOULINS RAN AWAY TO ENGLAND OR HID IN FRANCE.
FINALLY THE CONSTITUTION WAS COMPLETED. LOUIS XVI WAS PUT BACK ON THE THRONE AND CAME TO TAKE HIS OATH TO IT. HE WROTE I ENGAGE TO MAINTAIN IT AT HOME TO DEFEND IT FROM ALL ATTACKS FROM ABROAD AND TO CAUSE ITS EXECUTION BY ALL THE MEANS IT PLACES AT MY DISPOSAL. THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DECIDED THAT IT WOULD STOP GOVERNING FRANCE ON 29 SEPTEMBER 1791. AFTER THAT DATE THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY WOULD TAKE OVER.
THE NEW LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY MET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OCTOBER 1791. UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF 1791 FRANCE WAS A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY. THE KING SHARED HIS RULE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY BUT HAD THE POWER TO STOP VETO LAWS HE DID NOT LIKE. HE ALSO HAD THE POWER TO CHOOSE MINISTERS.
THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY HAD ABOUT 745 MEMBERS. 260 OF THEM WERE FEUILLANTS OR CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHISTS. 136 WERE GIRONDINS AND JACOBINS LEFT WING LIBERAL REPUBLICANS WHO DID NOT WANT A KING. THE OTHER 345 MEMBERS WERE INDEPENDENT BUT THEY VOTED MOST OFTEN WITH THE LEFT WING.
THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY DID NOT AGREE VERY WELL. THE KING USED HIS VETO TO STOP LAWS THAT WOULD SENTENCE MIGR S TO DEATH. BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY WERE LEFT WING THEY DID NOT LIKE THIS.
THE PEOPLE WERE TURNING AGAINST KING LOUIS XVI. ON 10 AUGUST 1792 THE MEMBERS OF A REVOLUTIONARY GROUP CALLED THE PARIS COMMUNE ATTACKED THE TUILERIES WHERE THE KING AND QUEEN WERE LIVING. THE KING AND QUEEN WERE TAKEN PRISONER. THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY HELD AN EMERGENCY MEETING. EVEN THOUGH ONLY A THIRD OF THE MEMBERS WERE THERE AND MOST OF THEM WERE JACOBINS THEY SUSPENDED THE KING FROM DUTY.
THE KINGS AND EMPERORS OF MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES WERE WORRIED BY THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. THEY DID NOT WANT REVOLUTIONS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES. ON 27 AUGUST 1791 LEOPOLD II OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE AUSTRIA FREDERICK WILLIAM II OF PRUSSIA AND LOUIS XVI S BROTHER IN LAW CHARLES PHILIPPE WROTE THE DECLARATION OF PILLNITZ. THE DECLARATION ASKED FOR LOUIS XVI TO BE SET FREE AND THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TO BE ENDED. THEY PROMISED THAT THEY WOULD INVADE FRANCE IF THEIR REQUESTS WERE IGNORED. THE DECLARATION WAS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY AMONG THE REVOLUTIONARIES.
WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IN PLACE THE PROBLEMS DID NOT GO AWAY. THE GIRONDINS WANTED WAR BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO TAKE THE REVOLUTION TO OTHER COUNTRIES. THE KING AND MANY OF HIS SUPPORTERS THE FEUILLANTS WANTED WAR BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE THE KING MORE POPULAR. MANY FRENCH WERE WORRIED THAT THE MIGR S WOULD CAUSE TROUBLE IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AGAINST FRANCE.
ON 20 APRIL 1792 THE ASSEMBLY VOTED TO DECLARE WAR ON AUSTRIA HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE. THEY PLANNED TO INVADE THE AUSTRIAN NETHERLANDS BUT THE REVOLUTION HAD MADE THE ARMY WEAK. MANY SOLDIERS DESERTED. SOON PRUSSIA JOINED ON THE AUSTRIAN SIDE. THEY BOTH PLANNED TO INVADE. TOGETHER ON 25 JULY THEY WROTE THE BRUNSWICK MANIFESTO PROMISING THAT IF THE ROYAL FAMILY WAS NOT HURT NO CIVILIANS WOULD BE HURT IN THE INVASION. THE FRENCH BELIEVED THAT THIS MEANT THE KING LOUIS XVI WAS WORKING WITH THE FOREIGN KINGS. PRUSSIA INVADED FRANCE ON 1 AUGUST 1792. THIS FIRST STAGE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY WARS CONTINUED UNTIL 1797.
IN SEPTEMBER THINGS GOT WORSE. THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY HAD ALMOST NO POWER. NO SINGLE GROUP WAS CONTROLLING PARIS OR FRANCE. THE COUNTRY WAS BEING INVADED BY THE PRUSSIAN ARMY. THE REVOLUTIONARIES WERE VERY ANGRY AND VIOLENT. THEY BEGAN TO GO INTO PRISONS AND KILL PEOPLE THEY THOUGHT WERE TRAITORS TO FRANCE. THEY HATED THE PRIESTS OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH THE MOST BUT THEY ALSO KILLED MANY NOBLES AND ORDINARY PEOPLE. BY 7 SEPTEMBER 1 400 PEOPLE WERE DEAD.
THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY HAD LOST ALL ITS POWER. FRANCE NEEDED A NEW GOVERNMENT. ON 20 SEPTEMBER 1792 THE NATIONAL CONVENTION WAS FORMED. THE CONVENTION HAD BOTH GIRONDINS AND RADICAL JACOBINS.
THE BRUNSWICK MANIFESTO HAD MADE MANY PEOPLE SUSPICIOUS OF THE KING. THEY THOUGHT HE WAS PLOTTING WITH THE PRUSSIAN AND AUSTRIAN RULERS TO INVADE FRANCE. IN JANUARY 1793 THE NATIONAL CONVENTION VOTED AND FOUND LOUIS XVI GUILTY OF CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE PUBLIC LIBERTY AND THE GENERAL SAFETY. ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF JANUARY THE KING WAS EXECUTED USING THE GUILLOTINE. MARIE ANTOINETTE THE QUEEN WAS ALSO EXECUTED ON THE SIXTEENTH OF OCTOBER.
PEOPLE IN THE AREA OF VEND E DID NOT LIKE THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT. THEY DID NOT LIKE THE RULES ABOUT THE CHURCH IN THE CIVIL CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH 1790 AND NEW TAXES PUT IN PLACE IN 1793. THEY ALSO DISLIKED BEING FORCED TO JOIN THE FRENCH ARMY. IN MARCH THEY ROSE UP AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT IN A REVOLT. THE WAR LASTED UNTIL 1796. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM VEND E VENDEANS WERE KILLED BY THE REVOLUTIONARY FRENCH ARMY.
NOW THAT THE KING WAS DEAD THE NATIONAL CONVENTION MADE A NEW REPUBLICAN CONSTITUTION THAT BEGAN ON 24 JUNE. IT WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT DID NOT INCLUDE THE KING AND GAVE EVERY MAN IN FRANCE A VOTE. HOWEVER IT NEVER CAME INTO POWER BECAUSE OF THE TROUBLE BETWEEN THE JACOBINS AND GIRONDINS. THE WAR WITH AUSTRIA AND PRUSSIA WAS CAUSING THE STATE TO HAVE MONEY PROBLEMS. BREAD WAS VERY EXPENSIVE AND MANY PEOPLE WANTED THINGS TO CHANGE. IN JUNE 1793 THE JACOBINS BEGAN TO TAKE POWER. THEY WANTED TO ARREST MANY GIRONDIN MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL CONVENTION. IN JULY THEY BECAME ANGRIER WHEN CHARLOTTE CORDAY A GIRONDIN KILLED JEAN PAUL MARAT A JACOBIN.
BY JULY THE COUP WAS COMPLETE. THE JACOBINS HAD TAKEN POWER. THEY PUT IN NEW RADICAL LAWS INCLUDING A NEW REPUBLICAN CALENDAR WITH NEW MONTHS AND NEW TEN DAY WEEKS. THEY MADE THE ARMY BIGGER AND CHANGED THE OFFICERS TO PEOPLE WHO WERE BETTER SOLDIERS. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THIS HELPED THE REPUBLICAN ARMY PUSH BACK THE ATTACKING AUSTRIANS PRUSSIANS BRITISH AND SPANISH.
IN JULY 1793 A JACOBIN CALLED MAXIMILIEN DE ROBESPIERRE AND EIGHT OTHER LEADING JACOBINS SET UP THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY. IT WAS THE MOST POWERFUL GROUP IN FRANCE. THIS GROUP AND ROBESPIERRE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REIGN OF TERROR. ROBESPIERRE BELIEVED THAT IF PEOPLE WERE AFRAID THE REVOLUTION WOULD GO BETTER. THE REIGN OF TERROR LASTED FROM THE SPRING OF 1793 TO THE SPRING OF 1794.
IT WAS NOT ONLY THE NOBILITY WHO DIED IN THE REIGN OF TERROR. ANYONE WHO BROKE THE JACOBINS LAWS OR WAS EVEN SUSPECTED OF BREAKING THEIR LAWS OR WORKING AGAINST THEM COULD BE ARRESTED AND SENT TO THE GUILLOTINE MOST WITHOUT A TRIAL. EVEN POWERFUL PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THE JACOBIN COUP WERE EXECUTED. PRISONERS WERE TAKEN FROM THE PRISONS TO MADAME GUILLOTINE A NICKNAME FOR THE GUILLOTINE IN AN OPEN WOODEN CART CALLED THE TUMBREL.
ACCORDING TO RECORDS 16 594 PEOPLE WERE EXECUTED WITH THE GUILLOTINE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UP TO 40 000 PEOPLE DIED IN PRISON OR WERE KILLED DURING THE REIGN OF TERROR.
BY JULY 1794 PEOPLE BEGAN TO TURN AGAINST MAXIMILIEN DE ROBESPIERRE. HE AND HIS REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL HAD KILLED 1 300 PEOPLE IN SIX WEEKS. ON 27 JULY THE NATIONAL CONVENTION AND THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY TURNED AGAINST HIM. ROBESPIERRE TRIED TO GET HELP FROM THE CONVENTION S RIGHT WING MEMBERS BUT HE FAILED.
A DAY LATER ROBESPIERRE AND MANY OF HIS SUPPORTERS IN THE PARIS COMMUNE WERE SENTENCED TO DEATH BY GUILLOTINE WITHOUT ANY KIND OF TRIAL. THIS REACTION AGAINST ROBESPIERRE IS CALLED THE THERMIDORIAN REACTION.
NOW THAT THE TERROR WAS OVER THE NATIONAL CONVENTION STARTED TO MAKE A NEW CONSTITUTION CALLED THE CONSTITUTION OF THE YEAR III. ON 27 SEPTEMBER 1794 THE CONSTITUTION CAME INTO EFFECT.
THE NEW CONSTITUTION HAD CREATED THE DIRECTOIRE DIRECTORY WHICH WAS THE FIRST GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE TO BE BICAMERAL SPLIT INTO TWO HOUSES. THE LOWER HOUSE THE PARLIAMENT HAD 500 MEMBERS. IT WAS CALLED THE CONSEIL DE CINQ CENT COUNCIL OF FIVE HUNDRED. THE UPPER HOUSE THE SENATE HAD 250 MEMBERS AND WAS CALLED THE CONSEIL DES ANCIENS COUNCIL OF ELDERS. THERE WERE FIVE DIRECTORS CHOSEN EVERY YEAR BY THE CONSEIL DES ANCIENS FROM A LIST MADE UP BY THE CONSEIL DE CINQ CENT. THIS GROUP WAS IN CHARGE AND WAS CALLED THE DIRECTORY.
ALTHOUGH THE CONSTITUTION OF 1793 HAD GIVEN ALL MEN IN FRANCE A VOTE IN THIS CONSTITUTION ONLY PEOPLE WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PROPERTY COULD VOTE.
THE DIRECTORY WAS MUCH MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN THE GOVERNMENTS IN FRANCE SINCE 1789. THE PEOPLE WERE TIRED OF RADICAL CHANGES AND THE UNSTABLE GOVERNMENTS. THINGS WERE MUCH MORE STABLE UNDER THE DIRECTORY THAN THEY HAD BEEN BEFORE.
HOWEVER THE DIRECTORS WERE DISLIKED BY THE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE JACOBINS WHO WANTED A REPUBLIC AND THE ROYALISTS WHO WANTED A NEW KING. FRANCE S MONEY PROBLEMS DID NOT GO AWAY. THE DIRECTORS IGNORED ELECTIONS THAT DID NOT GO THE WAY THEY WANTED. THEY IGNORED THE CONSTITUTION IN ORDER TO DO THINGS TO CONTROL THE PEOPLE. THEY USED THE ONGOING WAR AND THE ARMY TO KEEP THEIR POWER.
PEOPLE RIOTED AGAINST THE DIRECTORY BUT THE DIRECTORY USED THE ARMY TO STOP THEM. THE ARMY UNDER THE CORSICAN GENERAL NAPOLEON BONAPARTE BECAME MUCH MORE POWERFUL. ON 9 NOVEMBER 1799 18 BRUMAIRE YEAR VIII BONAPARTE TOOK POWER. THIS EVENT IS CALLED 18 BRUMAIRE. NAPOLEON BONAPARTE SET UP A NEW GOVERNMENT CALLED THE CONSULATE WITH HIM IN POWER. THIS LED TO HIM BECOMING THE DICTATOR AND IN 1804 THE EMPEROR OF FRANCE.
THE 18 BRUMAIRE MARKS THE END OF THE REPUBLICAN PART OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.
FRUIT
IN BOTANY A FRUIT IS A PLANT STRUCTURE THAT CONTAINS THE PLANT S SEEDS. TO A BOTANIST THE WORD FRUIT IS USED ONLY IF IT COMES FROM THE PART OF THE FLOWER WHICH WAS AN OVARY. IT IS AN EXTRA LAYER ROUND THE SEEDS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE FLESHY. HOWEVER EVEN IN THE FIELD OF BOTANY THERE IS NO GENERAL AGREEMENT ON HOW FRUITS SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED. MANY DO HAVE EXTRA LAYERS FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE FLOWER.
IN GENERAL SPEECH AND ESPECIALLY IN COOKING FRUITS ARE A SWEET PRODUCT AND MANY BOTANICAL FRUITS ARE KNOWN AS VEGETABLES. THIS IS HOW ORDINARY PEOPLE USE THE WORDS. ON THIS PAGE WE DESCRIBE WHAT BOTANISTS CALL A FRUIT.
THE FLESHY PART OF A FRUIT IS CALLED THE MESOCARP. IT IS BETWEEN THE FRUIT S SKIN EXOCARP AND THE SEEDS. THE WHITE PART OF AN APPLE FOR EXAMPLE IS THE FLESHY PART OF THE APPLE. USUALLY WHEN WE EAT A FRUIT WE EAT THE FLESHY PART.
IF THE ENTIRE FRUIT IS FLESHY EXCEPT FOR MAYBE A THIN SKIN WE CALL THE FRUIT A BERRY. A BERRY MIGHT CONTAIN ONE SEED OR MANY. GRAPES AVOCADOS AND BLUEBERRIES ARE BERRIES. THEY ALL HAVE A THIN SKIN BUT MOST OF THE FRUIT IS FLESHY. STRAWBERRIES HOWEVER ARE ACTUALLY NOT BERRIES BECAUSE THE SEEDS ARE ON THE OUTSIDE ON A REAL BERRY THE SEED OR SEEDS MUST BE INSIDE.
A PEPO PRONOUNCED PEE PO IS A MODIFIED BERRY. ITS SKIN IS HARD AND THICK AND IS USUALLY CALLED A RIND. PUMPKINS AND WATERMELONS FOR INSTANCE ARE PEPOS.
A HESPERIDIUM IS ANOTHER MODIFIED BERRY. IT HAS A LEATHERY SKIN THAT IS NOT AS HARD AS THE SKIN OF A PEPO. ALL CITRUS FRUIT LIKE ORANGES AND LEMON ARE HESPERIDIUMS.
A POME POHM IS A FRUIT THAT HAS A CORE SURROUNDED BY FLESHY TISSUE THAT WE CAN EAT. THE CORE IS USUALLY NOT EATEN. BERRIES ARE DIFFERENT THE SEEDS ARE INSIDE THE FLESHY PART NOT SEPARATED FROM IT BY A CORE. APPLES AND PEARS ARE POMES.
DRUPES ARE ALSO CALLED STONE FRUIT. A DRUPE IS A FLESHY FRUIT WITH A HARD STONE AROUND THE SEED. WE USUALLY CALL THIS STONE THE PIT OF THE FRUIT. PEACHES AND OLIVES ARE DRUPES. ACTUALLY THE ALMOND FRUIT IS A DRUPE TOO THOUGH WE EAT THE SEED THAT IS INSIDE THE PIT OF THE ALMOND FRUIT.
SINCE FRUITS ARE PRODUCED FROM FERTILISED OVARIES IN FLOWERS ONLY FLOWERING PLANTS PRODUCE FRUITS. FRUITS ARE AN EVOLUTIONARY INVENTION WHICH HELP SEEDS GET DISPERSED BY ANIMALS.
THE BOTANICAL TERM INCLUDES MANY THAT ARE NOT FRUITS IN THE COMMON SENSE OF THE TERM. SUCH AS THE VEGETABLES SQUASH PUMPKINS CUCUMBERS TOMATO PEAS BEANS CORN EGGPLANT AND SWEET PEPPER AND SOME SPICES SUCH AS ALLSPICE AND CHILLIES.
AN ACCESSORY FRUIT OR FALSE FRUIT PSEUDOCARP IS A FRUIT IN WHICH SOME OF THE FLESH IS DERIVED NOT FROM THE OVARY BUT FROM SOME ADJACENT TISSUE.
A FIG IS A TYPE OF ACCESSORY FRUIT CALLED A SYCONIUM. POMES SUCH AS APPLES AND PEARS ARE ALSO ACCESSORY FRUITS THE CORE IS THE TRUE FRUIT.
STRICTLY SPEAKING THESE ARE NOT BOTANICAL FRUITS 
THESE ARE FRUITS WHICH YOU CAN BUY IN SHOPS AND WHICH ARE ALSO ACCEPTABLE AS BOTANICAL FRUITS 
MANY FRUITS COME FROM TREES OR BUSHES. FOR PLANTS FRUITS ARE A MEANS OF DISPERSAL USUALLY BY ANIMALS. WHEN THE FRUIT BREAKS APART THE SEEDS CAN GO INTO THE GROUND AND BEGIN TO GROW. MOST FRUITS WE EAT CONTAIN A LOT OF WATER AND NATURAL SUGARS AND MANY ARE HIGH IN VITAMIN C. THEY HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF DIETARY FIBRE. FRUITS ARE USUALLY LOW IN PROTEIN AND FAT CONTENT BUT AVOCADOS AND SOME NUTS ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS. NOT ONLY HUMANS BUT OUR CLOSEST LIVING RELATIVES PRIMATES ARE KEEN FRUIT EATERS. SO ARE MANY OTHER GROUPS OF HERBIVOROUS MAMMALS AND MANY BIRDS.
SEEDLESSNESS IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF SOME FRUITS OF COMMERCE. COMMERCIAL BANANAS PINEAPPLE AND WATERMELONS ARE EXAMPLES OF SEEDLESS FRUITS. SOME CITRUS FRUITS ESPECIALLY ORANGES SATSUMAS MANDARIN ORANGES AND GRAPEFRUIT ARE VALUED FOR THEIR SEEDLESSNESS.
SEEDLESS BANANAS AND GRAPES ARE TRIPLOIDS AND SEEDLESSNESS RESULTS FROM THE ABORTION OF THE EMBRYONIC PLANT WHICH IS PRODUCED BY FERTILISATION. THE METHOD REQUIRES NORMAL POLLINATION AND FERTILISATION.
FUNGUS
A FUNGUS PLURAL FUNGI IS A KIND OF LIVING ORGANISM YEASTS MOULDS AND MUSHROOMS ARE TYPES OF FUNGI. THE FUNGI ARE A SEPARATE KINGDOM OF LIVING THINGS DIFFERENT FROM ANIMALS AND PLANTS.
FUNGI HAVE CELLS WITH NUCLEI. THEIR CELL WALLS CONTAIN CHITIN UNLIKE THE CELL WALLS OF PLANTS WHICH CONTAIN CELLULOSE. THESE AND OTHER DIFFERENCES SHOW THAT THE FUNGI FORM A SINGLE GROUP OF RELATED ORGANISMS CALLED THE EUMYCOTA OR EUMYCETES. THEY SHARE A COMMON ANCESTOR AND ARE MONOPHYLETIC GROUP.
THEIR BASIC MODE OF LIFE IS SAPROPHYTIC A FUNGUS BREAKS DOWN DEAD ORGANIC MATTER AROUND IT AND USES IT AS FOOD.
FUNGI REPRODUCE BOTH SEXUALLY AND ASEXUALLY. SOME FUNGI GROW MUSHROOMS THESE ARE FRUITING BODIES. UNDER THE CAP THERE ARE GILLS THE GILLS BEAR SPORES THAT WILL DISPERSE AND MAY DEVELOP INTO NEW FUNGI. OTHERWISE FUNGI USE A SPORANGIUM TO BEAR ASEXUAL SPORES BY MITOSIS OR SEXUAL SPORES BY MEIOSIS. THE SPORES ARE HAPLOID.
FUNGI MAY BE SINGLE CELLED OR MULTICELLULAR. YEAST IS SINGLE CELLED AND REPRODUCES EITHER SEXUALLY OR ASEXUALLY. ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION OCCURS BY SIMPLE BUDDING BINARY FISSION.
THE MYCELIUM IS THE VEGETATIVE NON REPRODUCTIVE PART OF A FUNGUS. IT IS USUALLY UNDERGROUND OR INSIDE SOME OTHER SUBSTANCE AND MADE OF FILAMENTS CALLED HYPHAE.
HYPHAE LOOK LIKE THREADS OR ROOTLETS. THE MAT OF HYPHAE MAY BE VERY THICKLY WOVEN. THE FUNGUS USES THEM TO EXTRACT NUTRIENTS.
HYPHAE ARE USUALLY SYNCYTIA. THIS MEANS THE CELL WALLS SEPTA ARE MOSTLY NOT COMPLETE AND THE CELL NUCLEI ARE NOT SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER AS IN NORMAL CELLS. DETAILS DIFFER BETWEEN SPECIES.
SYMBIOSIS MEANS LIVING TOGETHER. LICHENS ARE A SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN A FUNGUS AND AN ALGA OR BACTERIUM. IN THIS PARTNERSHIP THE ALGAL CELLS LIVE INSIDE THE FUNGUS TISSUE. THE END RESULT IS A NEW MAT LIKE LIFE FORM WHICH CLINGS TO ROCK AND OTHER SURFACES. ABOUT 20 OF ALL FUNGI ARE LICHENIZED.
ANOTHER IMPORTANT KIND OF SYMBIOSIS IS MYCORRHIZA. THIS IS WHEN A FUNGUS LIVES INSIDE PLANT ROOTS MOST TREES HAVE MYCORRHIZAL ROOTS AND SO DO MANY CROP PLANTS. BOTH SIDES BENEFIT IN THIS ARRANGEMENT.
SOME FUNGI CAUSE CROP DISEASES OTHERS CAUSE SERIOUS DISEASE IN HUMANS. SOME ARE HIGHLY POISONOUS NEVER EAT A MUSHROOM PICKED IN THE WILD UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
GREAT BARRIER REEF
THE GREAT BARRIER REEF IS THE WORLD S LARGEST CORAL REEF. IT IS CLOSE TO THE COAST OF QUEENSLAND AUSTRALIA. IT IS MADE UP OF NEARLY 3000 CORAL REEFS AND OVER 600 ISLANDS. IT IS 327 800 KM BIG AND 2600 KM LONG. IT HAS BEEN LISTED AN IMPORTANT WORLD HERITAGE SITE BY UNESCO. THE GREAT BARRIER REEF IS THE LARGEST STRUCTURE MADE BY LIVING THINGS. IT CAN BE SEEN FROM OUTER SPACE. THE REEFS ARE THREATENED.
THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE GREAT BARRIER REEF TODAY IS CORAL BLEACHING CAUSED BY HIGH SEA WATER TEMPERATURES AS A RESULT OF GLOBAL WARMING. DURING 2016 THE WORST DIE OFF EVER RECORDED OCCURED DUE TO SEAS WARMING AROUND THE GREAT BARRIER REEF. TWO THIRDS OF A 700 KM 435 MILES STRETCH OF CORAL IN NINE MONTHS WERE KILLED.
THE REEF RESEARCH CENTRE HAS FOUND THE REMAINS OF CORAL THAT ARE HALF A MILLION YEARS OLD. CORALS HAVE BEEN GROWING IN THE REGION FOR AS LONG AS 25 MILLION YEARS. THE CORALS HAVE NOT ALWAYS FORMED CORAL REEFS.
IT IS DIFFICULT TO WORK OUT THE AGE OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF. THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY A REEF CAN GROW AND SHRINK AS THE SEA LEVEL CHANGES. A CORAL REEF CAN GROW IN DIAMETER THAT IS HOW WIDE THEY ARE FROM 1 TO 2 CM PER YEAR. THEY CAN ALSO GROW UPWARDS FROM 1 TO 15 CM PER YEAR. CORAL CAN NOT GROW IF THE WATER IS TOO DEEP 150 METRES OR MORE BECAUSE IT NEEDS LIGHT FROM THE SUN. THEY CANNOT GROW OUT OF THE WATER ABOVE SEA LEVEL.
THE GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AUTHORITY AND AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF MARINE SCIENCE SAY THE CURRENT LIVING REEF STARTED GROWING ABOUT 20 000 YEARS AGO. IT STARTED TO GROW ON AN OLDER REEF. THIS MAKES THE BEGINNING OF THE REEF DURINGAY. THE LAND THAT FORMS THE BOTTOM OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF WAS A COASTAL PLAIN. THE PLAIN HAD SOME LARGE HILLS. SOME OF THESE HILLS WERE PARTS OF OLDER REEFS.
FROM 20 000 YEARS AGO UNTIL 6 000 YEARS THE SEA LEVEL BEGAN TO RISE. AS IT ROSE THE CORALS COULD GROW HIGHER ON THE HILLS OF THE COASTAL PLAIN. 13 000 YEARS AGO THE SEA LEVEL WAS 60 METRES LOWER THAN THE PRESENT DAY. CORALS BEGAN TO GROW AROUND THE HILLS OF THE COASTAL PLAIN. THESE BECAME CONTINENTAL ISLANDS. AS THE SEA LEVEL ROSE HIGHER MOST OF THESE CONTINENTAL ISLANDS WERE COVERED BY WATER. THE CORALS COULD THEN GROW OVER THE HILLS. THIS FORMED THE PRESENT CAYS AND REEFS. SEA LEVEL ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF HAS NOT RISEN MUCH IN THE LAST 6 000 YEARS. THE CRC REEF RESEARCH CENTRE HAS WORKED OUT THAT THE PRESENT LIVING REEF IS 6 000 TO 8 000 YEARS OLD.
THE REMAINS OF A VERY OLD BARRIER REEF HAS BEEN FOUND IN THE KIMBERLEY AREA. THIS IS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
THE GREAT BARRIER REEF WORLD HERITAGE AREA HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO 70 DIFFERENT AREAS. THESE ARE CALLED BIOREGIONS. EACH BIOREGION HAS ITS OWN SPECIAL PLANTS AND ANIMALS. THERE ARE 30 REEF BIOREGIONS AND 40 ARE NON REEF BIOREGIONS. IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF THERE ARE RIBBON REEFS AND DELTAIC REEFS. THESE KINDS OF REEF DO NOT EXIST IN THE REST OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF SYSTEM.
THE GREAT BARRIER REEF HAS 1 500 SPECIES OF FISH AND MANY OTHER ANIMALS ALGAE AND CORALS. THIS INCLUDES MANY VULNERABLE OR ENDANGERED SPECIES. SOME OF THESE EXIST ONLY ON THIS REEF SYSTEM.
THIRTY SPECIES OF WHALES DOLPHINS AND PORPOISES HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THE GREAT BARRIER REEF. THIS INCLUDES THE DWARF MINKE WHALE INDO PACIFIC HUMPBACK DOLPHIN AND THE HUMPBACK WHALE. MOST OF THE POPULATION OF THE DUGONGS LIVE THERE.
SIX SPECIES OF SEA TURTLES COME TO THE REEF TO BREED. THESE ARE THE GREEN SEA TURTLE LEATHERBACK SEA TURTLE HAWKSBILL TURTLE LOGGERHEAD SEA TURTLE FLATBACK TURTLE AND THE OLIVE RIDLEY. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS OF GREEN SEA TURTLES ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF. ONE GROUP LIVES IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE REEF AND THE OTHER IN THE SOUTH. FIFTEEN SPECIES OF SEAGRASS ATTRACT THE DUGONGS AND TURTLES. THEY ALSO PROVIDE A FOOD AND SHELTER FOR FISH. THE MOST COMMON KINDS OF SEAGRASSES ARE HALOPHILA AND HALODULE.
SALTWATER CROCODILES LIVE IN MANGROVE AND SALT MARSHES ON THE COAST NEAR THE REEF. NO CROCODILE NESTS HAVE BEEN FOUND ON THE REEF. THE SALT WATER CROCODILES ON THE REEF TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES. THERE ARE NOT MANY LIVING AROUND THE REEF. AROUND 125 SPECIES OF SHARK STINGRAY SKATES OR CHIMAERA LIVE ON THE REEF. ABOUT 5 000 SPECIES OF MOLLUSC LIVE ON THE REEF. THESE INCLUDE THE GIANT CLAM NUDIBRANCHS AND CONE SNAILS. FORTY NINE SPECIES OF PIPEFISH AND NINE SPECIES OF SEAHORSE HAVE BEEN FOUND. SEVEN SPECIES OF FROGS LIVE ON THE ISLANDS.ALSO THE MORAY EEL LIVES ON THE BOTTOM PREYING ON FISH.
215 SPECIES OF BIRDS COME TO THE REEF OR NEST OR ROOST ON THE ISLANDS. THIS INCLUDES 22 SPECIES OF SEABIRDS AND 32 SPECIES OF SHOREBIRDS. THESE INCLUDE THE WHITE BELLIED SEA EAGLE AND ROSEATE TERN. MOST NESTING SITES ARE ON ISLANDS IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN REGIONS OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF. ABOUT 1.7 MILLION BIRDS USE THE SITES TO BREED.
THE ISLANDS OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF HAVE 2 195 KNOWN PLANT SPECIES. THREE OF THESE DO NOT LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE. THE NORTHERN ISLANDS HAVE 300 350 PLANTS WHICH ARE WOODY. THE SOUTHERN ISLANDS HAVE 200 PLANTS WHICH ARE HERBACEOUS. THE WHITSUNDAY REGION HAS THE MOST PLANT SPECIES PLACING AT 1 141. THE PLANT SPECIES ARE MOSTLY SPREAD BY FISH
SEVENTEEN TYPES OF SEA SNAKE LIVE ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF. THEY TAKE ABOUT 4 YEARS TO BECOME OLD ENOUGH TO BREED. THEY USUALLY LIVE ON THE SEA FLOOR. THEY LIVE IN WARM WATERS UP TO DEEP. THEY ARE MORE COMMON IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE REEF.
MORE THAN 1 500 SPECIES OF FISH LIVE ON THE REEF. THESE INCLUDE THE CLOWNFISH RED BASS RED THROAT EMPEROR AND SEVERAL TYPES OF SNAPPER AND CORAL TROUT. THERE ARE AT LEAST 330 SPECIES OF SEA SQUIRTS ASCIDIANS ON THE REEF. THESE VARY IN SIZE FROM 1 MM 10 CM IN DIAMETER. BETWEEN 300 500 SPECIES OF BRYOZOANS LIVE ON THE REEF SYSTEM. THESE ARE SMALL WATER ANIMALS THAT LOOK LIKE MOSS OR
BRANCHES
FOUR HUNDRED SPECIES OF CORALS BOTH HARD CORALS AND SOFT CORALS LIVE ON THE REEF. MOST OF THESE SPAWN RELEASING THOUSANDS OF EGGS IN HUGE EVENTS. THIS SPAWNING IS CONTROLLED BY THE RISING SEA TEMPERATURES. THIS HAPPENS IN SPRING SUMMER AND SOME PARTS OF AUTUMN AS PART OF THE MOONS LUNAR CYCLE AND THE DAY NIGHT DIURNAL CYCLE. REEFS IN THE INNER GREAT BARRIER REEF SPAWN DURING THE WEEK AFTER THE FULL MOON IN OCTOBER. OUTER REEFS SPAWN IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER. THE COMMON SOFT CORALS ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF BELONG TO 36 DIFFERENT TYPES. FIVE HUNDRED SPECIES OF MARINE ALGAE OR SEAWEED LIVE ON THE REEF. THIS INCLUDES THIRTEEN TYPES OF HALIMEDA. THESE DEPOSIT CHALKY CALCAREOUS MOUNDS UP TO 100 METRES WIDE. THEY HAVE MINI ECOSYSTEMS ON THEIR SURFACE WHICH HAVE BEEN COMPARED TO RAINFOREST COVER.
A NEW REPORT THE REEF OUTLOOK REPORT SAYS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE WILL CAUSE HUGE DAMAGE TO THE REEF. THE REPORT WAS WRITTEN BY THE GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AUTHORITY. WARMER AND MORE ACIDIC WATER AROUND THE CORAL REEF WILL SLOW DOWN CALCIFICATION WHICH IS HOW THE CORAL GROWS AND BECOMES STRONG. THE CORALS WILL BECOME BLEACHED LOSE THEIR COLOURS AND MANY SPECIES THAT LIVE ON AND AROUND THE REEF WILL BE IN DANGER. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY SPENT AU 325 MILLION TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE REEF IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.
THE REEF OUTLOOK REPORT ALSO WARNED OF OTHER DANGERS TO THE REEF. THESE INCLUDED POOR QUALITY WATER RUNNING INTO THE SEA FROM THE MAINLAND. THIS WATER IS POLLUTED WITH FARM INSECTICIDES AND RUBBISH FROM NEARBY TOWNS. THE INCREASING AMOUNT OF DEVELOPMENT ON THE COAST IS DESTROYING NATURAL MARINE AND COASTAL HABITATS. THERE IS ALSO SOME DAMAGE FROM FISHING.
GUITAR
THE GUITAR IS A STRING INSTRUMENT WHICH IS PLAYED BY PLUCKING THE STRINGS. THE MAIN PARTS OF A GUITAR ARE THE BODY THE FRETBOARD THE HEADSTOCK AND THE STRINGS. GUITARS ARE USUALLY MADE FROM WOOD OR PLASTIC. THEIR STRINGS ARE MADE OF STEEL OR NYLON.
THE GUITAR STRINGS ARE PLUCKED WITH THE FINGERS AND FINGERNAILS OF THE RIGHT HAND OR LEFT HAND FOR LEFT HANDED PLAYERS OR A SMALL PICK MADE OF THIN PLASTIC. THIS TYPE OF PICK IS CALLED A PLECTRUM OR GUITAR PICK. THE LEFT HAND HOLDS THE NECK OF THE GUITAR WHILE THE FINGERS PLUCK THE STRINGS. DIFFERENT FINGER POSITIONS ON THE FRETBOARD MAKE DIFFERENT NOTES.
GUITAR LIKE PLUCKED STRING INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN USED FOR MANY YEARS. IN MANY COUNTRIES AND AT MANY DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS GUITARS AND OTHER PLUCKED STRING INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN VERY POPULAR BECAUSE THEY ARE LIGHT TO CARRY FROM PLACE TO PLACE THEY ARE EASIER TO LEARN TO PLAY THAN MANY OTHER INSTRUMENTS. GUITARS ARE USED FOR MANY TYPES OF MUSIC FROM CLASSICAL TO ROCK. MOST PIECES OF POPULAR MUSIC THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN SINCE THE 1950S ARE WRITTEN WITH GUITARS.
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF GUITARS CLASSIFIED ON HOW THEY ARE MADE AND THE TYPE OF MUSIC THEY ARE USED FOR. ALL TRADITIONAL TYPES OF GUITAR HAVE A BODY WHICH IS HOLLOW. THIS MAKES THE SOUND OF THE STRINGS LOUDER AND GIVES THE GUITAR ITS QUALITY. THIS TYPE OF GUITAR IS CALLED ACOUSTIC. AN ACOUSTIC INSTRUMENT IS ONE THAT MAKES ITS OWN DYNAMICS. 
FROM THE 1930S PEOPLE STARTED MAKING AND PLAYING GUITARS THAT USED ELECTRICITY AND AMPLIFIERS TO CONTROL THE LOUDNESS. THESE GUITARS WHICH ARE OFTEN USED IN POPULAR MUSIC ARE CALLED ELECTRIC GUITARS. THEY DO NOT NEED TO HAVE A HOLLOW BODY. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT USE ACOUSTICS TO AMPLIFY THE SOUND.
MOST GUITARS HAVE SIX STRINGS BUT THERE ARE ALSO GUITARS WITH FOUR SEVEN EIGHT TEN OR TWELVE STRINGS. MORE STRINGS MAKE THE INSTRUMENT SOUND FULLER. THE NECK OF A GUITAR HAS BARS OR MARKS CALLED FRETS. FRETS HELP A GUITARIST KNOW WHERE TO PUT HIS OR HER FINGERS TO GET THE RIGHT PITCH WHEN PLAYING.
THE WORD GUITAR WAS ADOPTED INTO ENGLISH FROM SPANISH WORD GUITARRA IN THE 1600S. IN THE MIDDLE AGES THE WORD GITTER OR GITTERN WAS USED IN ENGLAND. BOTH GUITARRA AND GITTER CAME FROM THE LATIN WORD CITHARA. THE WORD CITHARA CAME FROM THE EARLIER GREEK WORD KITHARA. KITHARA COULD HAVE COME FROM THE PERSIAN WORD SEHT R. SEH MEANING THREE AND T R MEANING STRING. THERE IS ALSO A SIMILAR BUT TWO STRINGED PERSIAN INSTRUMENT NAMED DOT R. DO MEANS TWO IN PERSIAN. THE INDIAN SITAR INSTRUMENT WAS NAMED AFTER THE PERSIAN SEHT R. THE SIHTAR ITSELF IS RELATED TO THE INDIAN INSTRUMENT THE SITAR.
A PERSON WHO PLAYS A GUITAR IS CALLED A GUITARIST. A PERSON WHO MAKES OR FIXES GUITARS IS A LUTHIER WHICH COMES FROM THE WORD LUTE. THE WORD LUTE COMES FROM THE ARABIC AL UUD A STRINGED INSTRUMENT FROM THE MIDDLE EAST.
THE GUITAR APPEARS TO BE DERIVED FROM EARLIER INSTRUMENTS KNOWN IN ANCIENT CENTRAL ASIA AS THE SITARA. INSTRUMENTS VERY SIMILAR TO THE GUITAR APPEAR IN ANCIENT CARVINGS AND STATUES RECOVERED FROM THE OLD IRANIAN CAPITOL OF SUSA. THE MODERN WORD GUITAR WAS ADOPTED INTO ENGLISH FROM THE SPANISH WORD GUITARRA WHICH CAME FROM THE OLDER GREEK WORD KITHARA. POSSIBLE SOURCES FOR VARIOUS NAMES OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS THAT GUITAR COULD BE DERIVED FROM APPEAR TO BE A COMBINATION OF TWO INDO EUROPEAN ROOTS GUIT SIMILAR TO SANSKRIT SANGEET MEANING MUSIC AND TAR A WIDELY FOUND ROOT MEANING CORD OR STRING.
THE WORD GUITAR IS A WORD THAT THE IBERIAN ARABIC LANGUAGE TOOK FROM THE PERSIAN LANGUAGE. THE WORD QITARA IS AN ARABIC NAME FOR VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE LUTE FAMILY THAT PRECEDED THE WESTERN GUITAR. THE WORD GUITARRA WAS INTRODUCED INTO SPANISH WHEN SUCH INSTRUMENTS WERE BROUGHT INTO IBERIA BY THE MOORS AFTER THE 10TH CENTURY.
THERE HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTS LIKE THE GUITAR FOR AT LEAST 5 000 YEARS. THE GUITAR MAY HAVE COME FROM OLDER INSTRUMENTS KNOWN AS THE SITARA FROM ANCIENT INDIA AND CENTRAL ASIA. THE OLDEST KNOWN PICTURE OF A GUITAR LIKE INSTRUMENT IS A 3300 YEAR OLD STONE CARVING OF A HITTITE BARD. THE OLDEST GUITAR LIKE INSTRUMENT THAT IS STILL COMPLETE IS THE WARWICK GITTERN IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM. IT BELONGED TO ELIZABETH I OF ENGLAND AND PROBABLY TO HER FATHER HENRY VIII BEFORE IT WAS GIVEN TO HER. IT IS ABOUT 500 YEARS OLD.
THE DESIGN OF THE MODERN GUITAR BEGAN WITH THE ROMAN CITHARA. THE CITHARA WAS BROUGHT BY THE ROMANS TO HISPANIA SPAIN AROUND 40 AD. IN THE 8TH CENTURY THE MOORS BROUGHT THE FOUR STRINGED OUD INTO SPAIN. THE INTRODUCTION TO THE OUD CAUSED CHANGES TO THE DESIGN OF THE CITHARA. IN OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE THE SIX STRING SCANDINAVIAN LUT LUTE BECAME POPULAR WHEREVER THE VIKINGS HAD BEEN. BY 1200 AD THERE WERE TWO TYPES OF THE FOUR STRING GUITAR THE GUITARRA MORISCA MOORISH GUITAR FROM SPAIN WHICH HAD A ROUNDED BACK WIDE FINGERBOARD AND SEVERAL SOUNDHOLES AND THE GUITARRA LATINA LATIN GUITAR WHICH WAS MORE LIKE THE MODERN GUITAR WITH ONE SOUND HOLE AND A NARROWER NECK.
THE SPANISH VIHUELA OF THE 16TH CENTURY WAS ANOTHER INSTRUMENT SIMILAR TO THE GUITAR. IT HAD LUTE STYLE TUNING AND A BODY THAT WAS LIKE A GUITAR. THE VIHUELA WAS ONLY POPULAR FOR A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER IT WAS SIMPLY A DESIGN THAT COMBINED FEATURES OF THE OUD AND LUTE OR A TRANSITION FROM THE RENAISSANCE INSTRUMENT TO THE MODERN GUITAR.
THE VINACCIA FAMILY FROM NAPLES ITALY WERE FAMOUS MANDOLIN MAKERS. IT IS THOUGHT THAT THEY ALSO MADE THE OLDEST SIX STRING GUITAR THAT STILL EXISTS. THERE IS A GUITAR BUILT THAT WAS SIGNED AND DATED 1779 ON THE LABEL BY GAETANO VINACCIA 1759 AFTER 1831 ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY FAKES THAT HAVE DATES ON THEM FROM THAT TIME THIS GUITAR IS BELIEVED BY EXPERTS TO BE GENUINE REAL.
THE GUITAR S DESIGN WAS IMPROVED MADE BETTER BY THE FAMOUS SPANISH LUTHIER ANTONIO TORRES JURADO 1817 1892 AND BY LOUIS PANORMO OF LONDON.
THE ELECTRIC GUITAR WAS MADE BY GEORGE BEAUCHAMP IN 1936. BEAUCHAMP CO FOUNDED A COMPANY CALLED RICKENBACHER TO MAKE GUITARS. HOWEVER DANELECTRO WAS THE FIRST TO PRODUCE ELECTRIC GUITARS FOR THE PUBLIC TO USE.
A GUITAR WAS DESCRIBED BY DR. MICHAEL KASHA AS AN INSTRUMENT THAT HAD A LONG FRETTED NECK FLAT WOODEN SOUNDBOARD RIBS AND A FLAT BACK MOST OFTEN WITH INCURVED SIDES.
MODERN GUITARS COME IN FOUR MAIN TYPES. THE CLASSICAL GUITAR IS USED FOR CLASSICAL MUSIC. THE TERM ACOUSTIC GUITAR IS GENERALLY USED FOR A GUITAR USED FOR POPULAR MUSIC EVEN THOUGH A CLASSICAL GUITAR IS ALSO AN ACOUSTIC INSTRUMENT. THERE ARE MANY OTHER DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACOUSTIC GUITARS FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD.
A ELECTRIC GUITAR CAN BE FLAT HOLLOW OR SEMI HOLLOW SOLID WITH HOLLOW POCKETS ON THE SIDES AND PRODUCES SOUND THROUGH ITS PICKUPS WHICH ARE WIRE WOUND MAGNETS THAT ARE SCREWED ONTO THE GUITAR. SOME GUITARS COMBINE THE HOLLOW ACOUSTIC BODY WITH AMPLIFIED SOUND. BASS GUITARS ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE A LOW BASS RHYTHM.
A SPECIAL ELECTRIC FOLDING TRAVEL GUITAR CALLED THE FOLDAXE BRIEFLY MANUFACTURED BY HOYER IN 1977 WAS INVENTED FOR CHET ATKINS IN ATKINS BOOK ME AND MY GUITARS BY INVENTOR AND GUITARIST ROGER FIELD FEATURING A BUILT IN WAY TO KEEP THE STRING TENSION AND TUNING THE SAME EVEN WHEN FOLDED AND READY TO PLAY WHEN UNFOLDED. ATKINS DEMONSTRATED HIS SEVERAL TIMES ON US TELEVISION AND ALSO ON THE TODAY SHOW WITH LES PAUL WHO WAS WITH HIM AS A GUEST.
GUITARS ARE USED IN MANY DIFFERENT GENRES OF MUSIC SUCH AS TRADITIONAL REGIONAL AND FOLK TO MODERN PUNK ROCK METAL OR POP. GUITARS ARE USED AS RHYTHM INSTRUMENTS LEAD INSTRUMENTS AND SOMETIMES BOTH.
A CAPO IS A DEVICE WHICH CAN BE PLACED ON ANY OF THE GUITAR S FRETS WHICH DON T LIE ON THE BODY ITSELF. THIS ENABLES THE USER TO CHANGE KEY WITHOUT CHANGING THE TUNING OF THE GUITAR STRINGS. THEIR ARE MULTIPLE TYPES OF CAPOS SOME LATCH AROUND THE WHOLE GUITAR NECK AND SOME JUST CLAMP ONTO THE BACK AND FRET BOARD. 
HISPANIOLA
HISPANIOLA IS AN ISLAND IN THE CARIBBEAN SEA. IT IS THE SECOND LARGEST ISLAND AFTER CUBA OF THE WEST INDIES EAST OF CUBA AND WEST OF PUERTO RICO.
THE REPUBLIC OF HAITI OCCUPIES THE WESTERN THREE EIGHTHS THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC THE REST. HISPANIOLA IS ONE OF TWO CARIBBEAN ISLANDS IN WHICH THERE ARE TWO COUNTRIES THE OTHER IS SAINT MARTIN.
WHEN COLUMBUS ARRIVED TO AMERICA SOME GROUPS OF NATIVE PEOPLE COMING FROM NORTHERN SOUTH AMERICA HAD LIVED IN THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS SINCE A VERY LONG TIME. THAT MOVEMENT FROM SOUTH AMERICA TO THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS WAS NOT CONTINUOUS BUT IT HAPPENED IN SEVERAL WAVES DURING ALMOST TWELVE CENTURIES.
ARCHEOLOGICAL STUDIES SUGGESTS THAT THOSE PEOPLE FROM SOUTH AMERICA CAME TO THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS DURING FOUR PERIODS.
THE FIRST PERIOD BEGAN AROUND 5000 B.C. FOR MOST CARIBBEAN ISLANDS THIS PERIOD ENDED AROUND 2000 YEARS AGO EXCEPT IN CUBA AND HISPANIOLA WHERE THERE WERE SOME SMALL POPULATIONS IN WESTERN CUBA AND SOUTHWESTERN HISPANIOLA WHEN THE EUROPEANS ARRIVED TO THESE ISLANDS. THEY WERE CALLED CIBONEY OR SIBONEY BY THE TA NOS MEANING MAN THAT LIVES AMONG ROCKS CIBA MEANS STONE AND EYERI MAN.
THE SECOND GROUP WAS THE IGNERI THE FIRST ARAWAK INDIANS TO COME TO THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS. THEY DISPLACED THE CIBONEY PEOPLE AND LATER THEY WERE DISPLACED BY ANOTHER GROUP OF ARAWAK INDIANS THE TA NOS. TA NOS OCCUPIED ALL THE GREATER ANTILLES CUBA JAMAICA HISPANIOLA AND PUERTO RICO AND THEY DEVELOPED A CULTURE DIFFERENT FROM THE CULTURE OF THE ARAWAKS OF SOUTH AMERICA. THEY WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT THE SPANISH MET IN THE AMERICAS.
THE FOURTH AND LAST GROUP WAS THE CARIB. THE CARIB WERE ALSO ARAWAKS BUT WITH A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. EVEN IF THEY USED TO GO TO PUERTO RICO AND THE HISPANIOLA TO FIGHT AGAINST THE TA NOS THEY LIVED ONLY IN THE LESSER ANTILLES WHEN COLUMBUS GOT TO AMERICA.
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE SPANISH CAME TO THE HISPANIOLA MOST OF THE ISLAND WAS OCCUPIED BY TA NOS ONLY IN THE WESTERN TIP OF THE SOUTHERN PENINSULA IN MODERN HAITI THERE WERE SOME SMALL GROUPS OF CIBONEY IN THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE ISLAND SAMAN PENINSULA AND NORTH OF THE NORTHERN MOUNTAIN RANGE THERE WAS A GROUP CALLED CIGUAYOS AND SOMETIMES MACORIX WITH THE SAME CULTURE OF THE TA NOS BUT A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. IT SEEMS THAT THEY WERE CARIB THAT TOOK THE TA NO CULTURE. THEY WERE THE FIRST INDIANS THAT FOUGHT AGAINST THE EUROPEANS.
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS ARRIVED TO THE ISLAND ON DECEMBER 5 1492 NAMING IT AS LA ESPA OLA MEANING THE SPANISH ISLAND. WHEN PETER MARTYR D ANGHIERA WROTE IN LATIN ABOUT THIS ISLAND HE WROTE HISPANIOLA MEANING SMALL SPAIN THAT WAS NOT CORRECT. BECAUSE THE BOOK OF ANGHIERA WAS TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH VERY SOON THE NAME HISPANIOLA IS THE MOST USED IN ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES AND IN SCIENTIFIC WORKS.
FOR CENTURIES OTHER NAMES WERE USED FOR THE ISLAND. THE MOST COMMON WERE SANTO DOMINGO ISLAND THE DOMINICAN CONSTITUTION STILL USES THAT NAME AND HAITI.
HISPANIOLA WAS THE ONLY ISLAND THAT COLUMBUS VISITED IN ALL HIS FOUR TRAVELS TO THE AMERICAS. HE SAW THE ISLAND FOR THE FIRST TIME ON DECEMBER 5 1492 BUT HE STAYED ON HIS SHIP DURING THE NIGHT THE NEXT DAY HE WENT TO LAND. THE SPANIARDS SPENT THE REST OF DECEMBER TRAVELING ALONG THE NORTH COAST OF HAITI ON DECEMBER 12 COLUMBUS TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ISLAND IN THE NAME OF THE KING AND QUEEN OF SPAIN AND NAMED THE ISLAND AS LA ESPA OLA.
ON CHRISTMAS EVE DECEMBER 24 THE MAIN SHIP SANTA MAR A WAS BADLY DAMAGED. THE NEXT DAY CHRISTMAS DAY COLUMBUS GAVE ORDERS TO USE THE WOOD OF THE SHIP TO BUILD A SMALL FORT ON WHAT IS NOW M LE SAINT NICOLAS HAITI. THAT FORT WAS NAMED LA NAVIDAD NAVIDAD MEANS CHRISTMAS AND WAS THE FIRST EUROPEAN BUILDING ON AMERICAN SOIL. COLUMBUS LEFT 39 MEN THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT SPACE IN THE OTHER TWO SHIPS FOR ALL THE PEOPLE.
FROM LA NAVIDAD THEY TRAVELED EAST ALONG THE NORTH COAST OF THE ISLAND AND IN SAMAN THEY HAD A SMALL FIGHT WITH SOME NATIVES CIGUAYOS NOT TA NO INDIANS AND NAMED THE BAY AS GOLFO DE LAS FLECHAS GULF OF THE ARROWS BUT NOW IS CALLED SAMAN BAY. FROM THERE THEY WENT BACK TO SPAIN.
IN 1493 COLUMBUS FOUND WHEN HE RETURNED IN HIS SECOND TRIP THAT LA NAVIDAD WAS DESTROYED BY THE INDIANS AND ALL SPANIARDS KILLED. THEN HE WENT TO THE EAST FOUNDING THE FIRST EUROPEAN CITY IN THE AMERICAN CONTINENT NEAR THE PRESENT CITY OF PUERTO PLATA HE NAMED THE CITY LA ISABELA IN HONOR OF QUEEN ISABELLA OF CASTILE. THE FIRST CATHOLIC MASS IN AMERICA WAS CELEBRATED AT LA ISABELA ON JANUARY 6 1494. FROM LA ISABELA COLUMBUS SENT GROUPS OF PERSONS TO EXPLORE AND TAKE CONTROL OF THE ISLAND.
BECAUSE LA ISABELA WAS AN UNHEALTHY SITE BARTHOLOMEW COLUMBUS BROTHER OF CHRISTOPHER ESTABLISHED A NEW CITY LA NUEVA ISABELA THE NEW ISABELA ON THE SOUTH COAST OF THE ISLAND ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE OZAMA RIVER. BECAUSE A HURRICANE DESTROYED THE CITY IT WAS BUILT AGAIN BUT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE RIVER AND WITH THE NEW NAME OF SANTO DOMINGO. IT IS THE OLDEST PERMANENT EUROPEAN CITY IN THE AMERICAS.
THE TA NO POPULATION OF THE ISLAND DECREASED VERY FAST BECAUSE A COMBINATION OF NEW DISEASES LIKE SMALLPOX AND ABUSES BY THE SPANIARDS. EVEN IF SOME BLACK SLAVES WERE BROUGHT FROM SPAIN SINCE 1501 THE COLONY BEGAN TO IMPORT AFRICAN SLAVES WHEN THE COLONY BEGAN TO GROW SUGAR CANE AROUND 1516 TO PRODUCE SUGAR.
SPAIN KEPT CONQUERING NEW REGIONS OF THE AMERICAS AND FOR THE SPANISH PEOPLE THOSE NEW REGIONS WERE MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE WAS MORE GOLD THE POPULATION OF THE ISLAND GREW VERY SLOWLY. BY THE EARLY 17TH CENTURY THE ISLAND AND ITS SMALLER NEIGHBORS ABOVE ALL THE TORTUGA ISLAND BECAME PLACES OFTEN VISITED BY CARIBBEAN PIRATES. IN 1606 THE KING OF SPAIN GAVE THE ORDER THAT ALL INHABITANTS OF HISPANIOLA HAD TO MOVE CLOSE TO THE CITY OF SANTO DOMINGO TO AVOID INTERACTION WITH PIRATES AND PROTESTANT PEOPLE. THIS RESULTED IN FRENCH BRITISH AND DUTCH PIRATES ESTABLISHING BASES ON THE ABANDONED NORTH AND WEST COASTS OF THE ISLAND.
IN 1665 THE PRESENCE OF FRENCH PEOPLE ON THE ISLAND HAD THE OFFICIAL APPROVAL OF THE FRENCH KING LOUIS XIV AND HE NAMED BERTRAND D OGERON AS THE GOVERNOR OF THE WESTERN PART OF HISPANIOLA IN FRENCH SAINT DOMINGUE. BY THE TREATY OF RYSWICK SPAIN GAVE THE WESTERN THIRD OF THE ISLAND TO FRANCE AND KEPT THE EASTERN PART. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FRENCH SAINT DOMINGUE WAS VERY FAST BOTH IN WEALTH AND POPULATION AND IT BECAME THE RICHEST COLONY IN THE CARIBBEAN. THE EASTERN SPANISH COLONY OF SANTO DOMINGO REMAINED POOR AND WITH A VERY LOW POPULATION.
THE ISLAND OF HISPANIOLA HAS AN AREA OF 76 480 KM. THERE ARE TWO COUNTRIES THE REPUBLIC OF HAITI IS IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE ISLAND AND THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC IN THE EASTERN PART. THESE TWO COUNTRIES ARE SEPARATED BY AN ARTIFICIAL BORDER EXCEPT IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN EXTREMES WHERE THEY ARE SEPARATED BY THE RIVERS DAJAB N AND PEDERNALES RESPECTIVELY.
THE ISLAND IS SEPARATED FROM CUBA BY THE WINDWARD PASSAGE 81 KM FROM PUNTA MAIS IN CUBA TO CAPE SAINT NICOLAS IN HAITI FROM JAMAICA BY THE JAMAICA CHANNEL 186 KM FROM POINT MORANTE IN JAMAICA TO CAPE IROIS IN HAITI AND FROM PUERTO RICO BY THE MONA CHANNEL 112 KM FROM PUNTA HIG ERO IN PUERTO RICO TO PUNTA DE AGUA IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.
THE MAXIMUN LENGTH EAST TO WEST IS 650 KM FROM CAPE ENGA O TO CAPE IROIS. THE MAXIMUM WIDTH NORTH TO SOUTH IS 265 KM FROM CAPE ISABELA TO CAPE BEATA. THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE ISLAND AND OF THE CARIBBEAN IS DUARTE PEAK PICO DUARTE IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC WITH 3 087 M THE LOWEST POINT IS IN THE ENRIQUILLO LAKE WHICH IS ABOUT 46 METERS UNDER SEA LEVEL.
THERE ARE MANY SMALLER ISLANDS AROUND THE HISPANIOLA. THE LARGEST ARE 
THE HISPANIOLA IS AN ISLAND WITH MANY MOUNTAINS AND THE HIGHEST PEAKS OF THE WEST INDIES ARE HERE. THE CHAINS OF MOUNTAINS SHOW A DIRECTION NORTHWEST SOUTHEAST EXCEPT IN THE SOUTHERN PENINSULA IN HAITI WHERE THEY HAVE A DIRECTION WEST EAST. THE MOUNTAINS ARE SEPARATED BY VALLEYS WITH THE SAME GENERAL DIRECTION.
FROM NORTH TO SOUTH THE MOUNTAIN RANGES AND VALLEYS ARE 
THE SOURCES OF THE LONGEST RIVERS OF HISPANIOLA ARE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF THE CORDILLERA CENTRAL DOMINICAN REPUBLIC MASSIF DU NORD HAITI.
THE 10 LONGEST RIVERS OF THE ISLAND ARE 
THE LARGEST LAKE OF THE HISPANIOLA AND OF THE WEST INDIES IS THE LAKE ENRIQUILLO. IT IS IN THE HOYA DE ENRIQUILLO WITH AN AREA OF 265 KM. THERE ARE THREE SMALL ISLANDS WITHIN THE LAKE. IT IS AROUND 40 METERS BELOW SEA LEVEL AND IS A SALINE LAKE WITH A HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF SALT THAN THE SEA WATER.
THE SECOND LARGEST LAKE TANG SAUM TRE ALSO KNOWN AS LAKE AZUEI IS CLOSE TO LAKE ENRIQUILLO BUT IN HAITI IN THE CUL DE SAC. IT IS ALSO A SALINE LAKE WITH AN AREA OF AROUND 170 KM.
OTHERS LAKES ARE RINC N FRESH WATER AREA OF 28.2 KM OVIEDO BRACKISH WATER AREA OF 28 KM REDONDA LIM N TANG DE MIRAGO NE.
HISPANIOLA HAS A TROPICAL CLIMATE BUT MODIFIED BY ELEVATION AND THE TRADE WINDS WINDS THAT COME FROM THE NORTHEAST FROM THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. AT SEA LEVEL THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE IS 25 C WITH SMALL CHANGES FROM ONE SEASON TO ANOTHER. IN THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS THE TEMPERATURE IN WINTER CAN BE AS LOW AS 0 C.
THERE ARE TWO WET SEASONS APRIL JUNE AND SEPTEMBER NOVEMBER. THE MOST DRY PERIOD IS FROM DECEMBER TO MARCH.
RAINFALL VARIES GREATLY EASTERN REGIONS LIKE THE SAMAN PENINSULA GET AN AVERAGE OF OVER 2 000 MM IN A YEAR BUT LESS THAN 500 MM FALL IN THE SOUTHWEST HOYA DE ENRIQUILLO CUL DE SAC.
FROM JUNE TO NOVEMBER HURRICANES ARE FREQUENT AND CAN DO MUCH DAMAGE IN THE ISLAND.
HISPANIOLA HAS A TOTAL POPULATION ESTIMATED FOR JULY 2013 OF 20 113 564 INHABITANTS FOR A DENSITY OF 263 INHABITANTS PER KM.
IN HAITI 95 OF THE POPULATION BELONGS TO THE BLACK ETHNIC GROUP IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 11 BELONGS TO THE BLACK ETHNIC GROUP AS WELL.
IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC ONLY SPANISH IS SPOKEN EXCEPT FOR GROUPS OF IMMIGRANTS EVEN IF HAITIAN CREOLE IS GAINING IMPORTANCE BECAUSE THE MASSIVE IMMIGRATION FROM HAITI. BOTH FRENCH AND HAITIAN CREOLE ARE SPOKEN IN HAITI AND BOTH ARE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES.
IN BOTH COUNTRIES THE MAIN RELIGION IS ROMAN CATHOLICISM. PROTESTANT GROUPS ARE IMPORTANT MORE IN HAITI 15 OF THE POPULATION THAN IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 5.
THE MOST IMPORTANT CITIES IN THE ISLAND ARE SANTO DOMINGO CAPITAL OF DOMINICAN REPUBLIC PORT AU PRINCE CAPITAL OF HAITI SANTIAGO DOMINICAN REPUBLIC CARREFOUR HAITI.
HISTORY OF GRAPHIC DESIGN
GRAPHICS FROM GREEK ARE VISUAL PRESENTATIONS ON SOME SURFACE SUCH AS A WALL CANVAS COMPUTER SCREEN PAPER OR STONE. IT INCLUDES EVERYTHING THAT RELATES TO CREATION OF SIGNS CHARTS LOGOS GRAPHS DRAWINGS SYMBOLS GEOMETRIC DESIGNS AND SO ON.
GRAPHIC DESIGN IS THE ART OR PROFESSION OF COMBINING TEXT AND PICTURES IN ART ADVERTISEMENTS PUBLICATIONS OR WEBSITES. THE AIM OF GRAPHICS IS TO BRAND INFORM AND HAVE A SPECIFIC EFFECT ON ITS AUDIENCE.
HUNDREDS OF GRAPHIC DESIGNS OF ANIMALS WERE MADE BY PRIMITIVE PEOPLE IN CHAUVET CAVE IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE ABOUT 30 000 BC. ALSO SIMILAR ART WAS DONE IN THE LASCAUX CAVE FRANCE ABOUT 14 000 BC. THE ART OF PRIMITIVE HUNTERS IS FOUND IN THE ROCKS OF BHIMBETKA IN INDIA DRAWN EARLIER THAN 7000 BC. ABORIGINAL ROCK ART IN KAKADU NATIONAL PARK OF AUSTRALIA SHOW THAT GRAPHICS HAS A LONG HISTORY IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD. THIS HISTORY WITH WRITING WHICH EMERGED IN 3000 4000 BC ARE THE FOUNDATION OF GRAPHIC ART.
RELIGIOUS BOOKS HAVE USED GRAPHICS EXTENSIVELY. AMONG THESE BOOKS ARE BIBLES THAT WERE CREATED IN THE MONASTERIES IN IRELAND SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND. SPIRALLING AND INTERLOCKING PATTERNS OFTEN INCLUDING SMALL FIGURES WERE PART OF THE ANCIENT GRAPHIC TRADITION OF THE BRITISH ISLES. FROM THE 6TH CENTURY ONWARDS THESE WERE APPLIED TO THE DECORATION OF ILLUMINATED GOSPELS.
IN ISLAMIC COUNTRIES THE GRAPHIC DESIGNS CAN BE FOUND IN THEIR HOLY BOOK THE QURAN. THE QURAN WAS FIRST WRIITEN AN ANGLED STYLE CALLED KUFI. THIS APPEARED IN THE 8TH CENTURY AND REACHED ITS PEAK IN THE 10TH CENTURY. LATER ON DECORATION OF MARGIN PAGE AND OTHER GRAPHIC TECHNIQUES WERE ADDED TO BEAUTIFY THE BOOK. IN THE 12TH CENTURY THE NASKH SCRIPT WAS INVENTED IT USED CURVES INSTEAD OF ANGLED LINES. OTHER STYLES WERE ADDED LATER ON.
FROM ANCIENT TIMES GRAPHIC DESIGN HAS BEEN USED FOR DECORATION OF POTTERY AND CERAMICS.
WILLIAM MORRIS HAD AN INFLUENCE ON MODERN GRAPHICS. IN THE SECOND HALF OF 19TH CENTURY HIS KELMSCOTT PRESS PRODUCED MANY GRAPHIC DESIGNS AND CREATED A COLLECTOR MARKET FOR THIS KIND OF ART. IN OXFORD HE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ARTISTS LIKE BURNE JONES AND DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI. THEY FORMED THE PRE RAPHAELITES GROUP WHOSE IDEAS INFLUENCED MODERN GRAPHIC DESIGN CONSIDERABLY.
THE DUTCH PAINTER PIET MONDRIAN IN THE YEARS 1920 21 COURAGEOUSLY INTRODUCED THE STYLE OF MINIMALISM IN PAINTING. HIS SIMPLE GEOMETRIC COMPOSITIONS TOGETHER WITH THE USE OF ONLY THREE BASIC COLORS BLUE YELLOW AND RED IN COMBINATION WITH BLACK AND WHITE CREATED
A NEW VENUE FOR THE GRAPHIC DESIGNERS. HE DEMONSTRATED THAT WITH SIMPLE RELOCATION OF THESE COLORS AND EXPERIMENTING WITH THE PROPORTIONALITY OF VARIOUS SQUARE SURFACES ONE CAN ACHIEVE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT AMBIANCES AND VARIOUS FEELINGS. FOR THE GRAPHIC DESIGNERS WHO INTEND TO CONVEY A MESSAGE WITH A MINIMUM INTERFERENCE FROM THE EXTRANEOUS ELEMENTS HIS EXPERIMENT IN MINIMALISM WAS A VALUABLE GIFT.
A TRADEMARK IDENTIFIED BY THE SYMBOLS AND OR MARK IS A DISTINCTIVE SIGN OR INDICATOR USED BY AN INDIVIDUAL COMPANY OR OTHER ENTITY TO IDENTIFY ITS PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AND TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM THOSE OF OTHER PRODUCERS. A TRADEMARK IS A TYPE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TYPICALLY A NAME WORD PHRASE LOGO SYMBOL DESIGN IMAGE OR A COMBINATION OF THESE ELEMENTS.
IN 1921 OTTO NEURATH AN AUSTRIAN SOCIAL SCIENTIST INTRODUCED GRAPHIC DESIGN TO HELP THE UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMICAL DATA. IN 1925 THE MUSEUM OF ECONOMY AND SOCIETY USED SUCH GRAPHICS FOR THE PUBLIC. THIS STYLE OF PRESENTATION AT THE TIME WAS CALLED THE VIENNESE METHOD BUT NOW IT IS KNOWN AS ISOTYPE CHARTS.
PLACARDS AND POSTERS EXISTED FROM ANCIENT TIMES. THE GREEK AXONS AND THE ROMAN ALBUMS WITH THEIR DECORATIVE DESIGNS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE QUITE SIMILAR TO TODAY S POSTERS. IN ANCIENT GREECE THE NAMES OF ATHLETES AND GAMES SCHEDULES WERE WRITTEN ON COLUMNS THAT WERE SLOWLY TURNING ON AN AXIS. ROMANS USED WHITEWASHED WALLS IN THEIR MARKETS IN WHICH SELLERS MONEY LENDERS AND SLAVE TRADERS WROTE THEIR ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ADVERTISED FOR THEIR PRODUCTS AND TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF CUSTOMERS THEY ADDED AN ATTRACTIVE DESIGN.
WITH THE INVENTION OF PRINTING IN 1440 AND PARTICULARLY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LITHOGRAPHIC PROCESS INVENTED BY A CZECH NAMED ALOIS SENEFELDER IN 1798 IN AUSTRIA CREATION OF POSTERS BECAME FEASIBLE. ALTHOUGH HANDMADE POSTERS EXISTED BEFORE THEY WERE MAINLY USED FOR GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENTS. WILLIAM CAXTON WHO IN 1477 STARTED A PRINTING COMPANY IN ENGLAND PRODUCED THE FIRST PRINTED POSTER.
IN 1870 THE ADVERTISING POSTER EMERGED.
AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR WITH THE EMERGENCE OF NEW COLOR PRINTING TECHNOLOGY AND PARTICULARLY APPEARANCE OF COMPUTERS THE ART OF POSTERS UNDERWENT A NEW REVOLUTIONARY PHASE. PEOPLE CAN CREATE COLOR POSTERS ON THEIR LAPTOP COMPUTERS AND CREATE COLOR PRINTS AT A VERY LOW COST. UNFORTUNATELY THE HIGH COST OF SOPHISTICATED PRINTING PROCESSES CAN ONLY BE AFFORDED MOSTLY BY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND LARGE CORPORATIONS. WITH THE EMERGENCE OF THE INTERNET THE ROLE OF POSTERS IN CONVEYING INFORMATION HAS GREATLY DIMINISHED. HOWEVER SOME ARTISTS STILL USE CHROMOLITHOGRAPHY IN ORDER TO CREATE WORKS OF ART IN THE FORM OF PRINT. IN THIS REGARD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAINTING AND PRINT HAS BEEN NARROWED CONSIDERABLY.
TODAY GRAPHIC DESIGN HAS PENETRATED INTO ALL ASPECTS OF MODERN LIFE. IN PARTICULAR MODERN ARCHITECTURE HAS BEEN INFLUENCED BY GRAPHICS.
HISTORY OF THE EARTH
THE HISTORY OF THE EARTH DESCRIBES THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS AND FUNDAMENTAL STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLANET EARTH FROM ITS FORMATION TO THE PRESENT DAY.
THE AGE OF THE EARTH IS ABOUT 4.56 BILLION YEARS. NEARLY ALL BRANCHES OF SCIENCE HAVE HELPED US UNDERSTAND THE MAIN EVENTS OF THE EARTH S PAST. THE EARTH IS ABOUT ONE THIRD THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE.
THE FORMATION OF EARTH OCCURRED AS PART OF THE FORMATION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. IT STARTED AS A LARGE ROTATING CLOUD OF DUST AND GAS. THIS CLOUD THE SOLAR NEBULA WAS COMPOSED OF HYDROGEN AND HELIUM PRODUCED IN THE BIG BANG AS WELL AS HEAVIER ELEMENTS PRODUCED IN SUPERNOVAS. THEN ABOUT 4.68 10 YEARS AGO THE SOLAR NEBULA BEGAN TO CONTRACT ROTATE AND GAIN ANGULAR MOMENTUM. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN TRIGGERED BY A STAR IN THE REGION EXPLODING AS A SUPERNOVA AND SENDING A SHOCK WAVE THROUGH THE SOLAR NEBULA.
AS THE CLOUD ROTATED IT BECAME A FLAT DISC PERPENDICULAR TO ITS AXIS OF ROTATION. MOST OF THE MASS CONCENTRATED IN THE MIDDLE AND BEGAN TO HEAT UP. MEANWHILE THE REST OF THE DISC BEGAN TO BREAK UP INTO RINGS WITH GRAVITY CAUSING MATTER TO CONDENSE AROUND DUST PARTICLES. SMALL FRAGMENTS COLLIDED TO BECOME LARGER FRAGMENTS INCLUDING ONE COLLECTION ABOUT 150 MILLION KILOMETERS FROM THE CENTER THIS WOULD BECOME THE EARTH. AS THE SUN CONDENSED AND HEATED NUCLEAR FUSION STARTED AND THE SOLAR WIND CLEARED OUT MOST OF THE MATERIAL IN THE DISC WHICH HAD NOT YET CONDENSED INTO LARGER BODIES.
THE EARTH S RELATIVELY LARGE NATURAL SATELLITE THE MOON IS UNIQUE. DURING THE APOLLO PROGRAM ROCKS FROM THE MOON S SURFACE WERE BROUGHT TO EARTH. RADIOMETRIC DATING OF THESE ROCKS HAS SHOWN THE MOON TO BE 4527 10 MILLION YEARS OLD ABOUT 30 TO 55 MILLION YEARS YOUNGER THAN OTHER BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. NEW EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE MOON FORMED EVEN LATER 4.48 0.02 GA OR 70 110 MA AFTER THE START OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. ANOTHER NOTABLE FEATURE IS THE RELATIVELY LOW DENSITY OF THE MOON WHICH MUST MEAN IT DOES NOT HAVE A LARGE METALLIC CORE LIKE ALL OTHER TERRESTRIAL BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THE MOON HAS A BULK COMPOSITION CLOSELY RESEMBLING THE EARTH S MANTLE AND CRUST TOGETHER WITHOUT THE EARTH S CORE. THIS HAS LED TO THE GIANT IMPACT HYPOTHESIS THE IDEA THAT THE MOON WAS FORMED DURING A GIANT IMPACT OF THE PROTO EARTH WITH ANOTHER PROTOPLANET.
THE IMPACTOR SOMETIMES NAMED THEIA IS THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THE CURRENT PLANET MARS. THEIA FINALLY COLLIDED WITH EARTH ABOUT 4.533 GA.
MODELS REVEAL THAT WHEN AN IMPACTOR THIS SIZE STRUCK THE PROTO EARTH AT A LOW ANGLE AND RELATIVELY LOW SPEED 8 20 KM SEC MUCH MATERIAL FROM THE MANTLES AND PROTO CRUSTS OF THE PROTO EARTH AND THE IMPACTOR WAS EJECTED INTO SPACE WHERE MUCH OF IT STAYED IN ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH. THIS MATERIAL WOULD EVENTUALLY FORM THE MOON. HOWEVER THE METALLIC CORES OF THE IMPACTOR WOULD HAVE SUNK THROUGH THE EARTH S MANTLE TO FUSE WITH THE EARTH S CORE DEPLETING THE MOON OF METALLIC MATERIAL. THE GIANT IMPACT HYPOTHESIS THUS EXPLAINS THE MOON S ABNORMAL COMPOSITION. THE EJECTA IN ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH COULD HAVE CONDENSED INTO A SINGLE BODY WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ITS OWN GRAVITY THE EJECTED MATERIAL BECAME A MORE SPHERICAL BODY THE MOON.
THE RADIOMETRIC AGES SHOW THE EARTH EXISTED ALREADY FOR AT LEAST 10 MILLION YEARS BEFORE THE IMPACT ENOUGH TIME TO ALLOW FOR DIFFERENTIATION OF THE EARTH S PRIMITIVE MANTLE AND CORE. THEN WHEN THE IMPACT OCCURRED ONLY MATERIAL FROM THE MANTLE WAS EJECTED LEAVING THE EARTH S CORE OF HEAVY ELEMENTS UNTOUCHED.
THE IMPACT HAD SOME IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES FOR THE YOUNG EARTH. IT RELEASED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY CAUSING BOTH THE EARTH AND MOON TO BE COMPLETELY MOLTEN. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE IMPACT THE EARTH S MANTLE WAS VIGOROUSLY CONVECTING THE SURFACE WAS A LARGE MAGMA OCEAN. THE PLANET S FIRST ATMOSPHERE MUST HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY BY THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY RELEASED. THE IMPACT IS ALSO THOUGHT TO HAVE CHANGED EARTH S AXIS TO PRODUCE THE LARGE 23.5 AXIAL TILT THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EARTH S SEASONS A SIMPLE IDEAL MODEL OF THE PLANETS ORIGINS WOULD HAVE AXIAL TILTS OF 0 WITH NO RECOGNIZABLE SEASONS. IT MAY ALSO HAVE SPED UP EARTH S ROTATION.
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ARCHAEAN THE EARTH S HEAT FLOW WAS NEARLY THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN IT IS TODAY AND WAS STILL TWICE THE CURRENT LEVEL BY THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTEROZOIC. THUS PLATES AND VOLCANIC ACTIVITY WERE CONSIDERABLY MORE ACTIVE THAN THEY ARE TODAY THE EARTH S CRUST WAS NOT ONLY THINNER THAN IS TODAY BUT PROBABLY BROKEN UP INTO MANY MORE TECTONIC PLATES WITH NUMEROUS HOT SPOTS RIFT VALLEYS AND TRANSFORM FAULTS. THE EXISTENCE OF PLATE TECTONICS IN THIS EON IS DISPUTED IT IS AN ACTIVE AREA OF MODERN RESEARCH.
THERE WERE NO LARGE CONTINENTS UNTIL LATE IN THE ARCHEAN SMALL PROTOCONTINENTS WERE THE NORM PREVENTED FROM COALESCING INTO LARGER UNITS BY THE HIGH RATE OF GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY. THESE FELSIC PROTOCONTINENTS PROBABLY FORMED AT HOT SPOTS RATHER THAN SUBDUCTION ZONES FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES MAFIC MAGMA MELTING MORE FELSIC ROCKS PARTIAL MELTING OF MAFIC ROCK AND FROM THE METAMORPHIC ALTERATION OF FELSIC SEDIMENTARY ROCKS.
THE ARCHEAN ATMOSPHERE APPARENTLY LACKED FREE OXYGEN. TEMPERATURES APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN NEAR MODERN LEVELS ALTHOUGH ASTRONOMERS THINK THAT THE SUN WAS ABOUT ONE THIRD DIMMER. THIS IS THOUGHT TO REFLECT LARGER AMOUNTS OF GREENHOUSE GASES THAN LATER IN EARTH HISTORY.
THE OLDEST ROCK FORMATIONS EXPOSED ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH ARE ARCHEAN OR SLIGHTLY OLDER. ARCHEAN ROCKS ARE KNOWN FROM GREENLAND THE CANADIAN SHIELD WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND SOUTHERN AFRICA. ALTHOUGH THE FIRST CONTINENTS FORMED DURING THIS EON ROCK THIS AGE MAKES UP ONLY 7 OF THE WORLD S CURRENT CRATONS EVEN ALLOWING FOR EROSION AND DESTRUCTION OF PAST FORMATIONS EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT ONLY 5 40 OF THE PRESENT CONTINENTAL CRUST FORMED DURING THE ARCHEAN.
IN CONTRAST TO THE PROTEROZOIC ARCHEAN ROCKS ARE OFTEN HEAVILY METAMORPHIZED DEEP WATER SEDIMENTS SUCH AS GREYWACKES MUDSTONES VOLCANIC SEDIMENTS AND BANDED IRON FORMATIONS. GREENSTONE BELTS ARE TYPICAL ARCHEAN FORMATIONS CONSISTING OF ALTERNATING HIGH AND LOW GRADE METAMORPHIC ROCKS. THE HIGH GRADE ROCKS WERE DERIVED FROM VOLCANIC ISLAND ARCS WHILE THE LOW GRADE METAMORPHIC ROCKS REPRESENT DEEP SEA SEDIMENTS ERODED FROM THE NEIGHBORING ISLAND ARCS AND DEPOSITED IN A FOREARC BASIN. IN SHORT GREENSTONE BELTS REPRESENT SUTURED PROTOCONTINENTS.
FOSSILS OF CYANOBACTERIAL MATS STROMATOLITES ARE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE ARCHEAN BECOMING ESPECIALLY COMMON LATE IN THE EON WHILE A FEW OTHER PROBABLE BACTERIAL FOSSILS ARE KNOWN FROM CHERT BEDS. IN ADDITION TO BACTERIA MICROFOSSILS OF THE EXTREMOPHILIC ARCHAEA HAVE ALSO BEEN IDENTIFIED.
THERE ARE NO KNOWN EUKARYOTE FOSSILS. NO FOSSIL EVIDENCE YET EXISTS FOR VIRUSES.
THE GEOLOGIC RECORD OF THE PROTEROZOIC IS MUCH BETTER THAN THAT FOR THE PRECEDING ARCHAEAN. IN CONTRAST TO THE DEEP WATER DEPOSITS OF THE ARCHEAN THE PROTEROZOIC FEATURES MANY STRATA THAT WERE LAID DOWN IN EXTENSIVE SHALLOW EPICONTINENTAL SEAS FURTHERMORE MANY OF THESE ROCKS ARE LESS METAMORPHOSED THAN ARCHEAN AGE ONES AND PLENTY ARE IN FACT UNALTERED. STUDY OF THESE ROCKS SHOW THAT THE EON FEATURED RAPID CONTINENTAL ACCRETION UNIQUE TO THE PROTEROZOIC SUPERCONTINENT CYCLES AND WHOLLY MODERN OROGENIC ACTIVITY.
THE FIRST KNOWN GLACIATIONS OCCURRED DURING THE PROTEROZOIC. ONE ICE AGE BEGAN SHORTLY AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE EON. THERE WERE AT LEAST FOUR DURING THE NEOPROTEROZOIC CLIMAXING WITH THE SNOWBALL EARTH OF THE VARANGIAN GLACIATION.
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS OF THE PROTEROZOIC WAS THE ACCUMULATION OF OXYGEN IN THE EARTH S ATMOSPHERE. THOUGH OXYGEN WAS UNDOUBTEDLY RELEASED BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS WELL BACK IN ARCHEAN TIMES IT COULD NOT BUILD UP TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE UNTIL CHEMICAL SINKS UNOXIDIZED SULFUR AND IRON HAD BEEN FILLED UNTIL ROUGHLY 2.3 BILLION YEARS AGO OXYGEN WAS PROBABLY ONLY 1 TO 2 OF ITS CURRENT LEVEL. STANLEY 323 BANDED IRON FORMATIONS WHICH PROVIDE MOST OF THE WORLD S IRON ORE WERE ALSO A PROMINENT CHEMICAL SINK MOST ACCUMULATION CEASED AFTER 1.9 BILLION YEARS AGO EITHER DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OXYGEN OR A MORE THOROUGH MIXING OF THE OCEANIC WATER COLUMN.
RED BEDS WHICH ARE COLOURED BY HAEMATITE INDICATE AN INCREASE IN ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN AFTER 2 BILLION YEARS AGO THEY ARE NOT FOUND IN OLDER ROCKS. STANLEY 324 THE OXYGEN BUILD UP WAS PROBABLY DUE TO TWO FACTORS A FILLING OF THE CHEMICAL SINKS AND AN INCREASE IN CARBON BURIAL WHICH STORED ORGANIC COMPOUNDS WHICH WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN OXIDIZED BY THE ATMOSPHERE.
THE FIRST ADVANCED SINGLE CELLED AND MULTI CELLULAR LIFE ROUGHLY COINCIDES WITH THE OXYGEN ACCUMULATION THIS MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE OXIDIZED NITRATES THAT EUKARYOTES USE AS OPPOSED TO CYANOBACTERIA. STANLEY 325 IT WAS ALSO DURING THE PROTEROZOIC THAT THE FIRST SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MITOCHONDRIA FOR ANIMALS AND PROTISTS AND CHLOROPLASTS FOR PLANTS AND THEIR HOSTS EVOLVED.
EUKARYOTES SUCH AS ACRITARCHS BLOSSOMED AS DID CYANOBACTERIA IN FACT STROMATOLITES REACHED THEIR GREATEST ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY DURING THE PROTEROZOIC PEAKING ROUGHLY 1.2 BILLION YEARS AGO.
CLASSICALLY THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE PROTEROZOIC AND THE PALEOZOIC WAS SET AT THE BASE OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD WHEN THE FIRST FOSSILS OF ANIMALS KNOWN AS TRILOBITES APPEARED. IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY A NUMBER OF FOSSIL FORMS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN PROTEROZOIC ROCKS BUT THE BOUNDARY OF THE PROTEROZOIC HAS REMAINED FIXED AT THE BASE OF THE CAMBRIAN CURRENTLY PLACED AT 542 MA.
THE PALEOZOIC COVERS THE TIME FROM THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF ABUNDANT HARD SHELLED FOSSILS TO THE TIME WHEN THE CONTINENTS WERE BEGINNING TO BE DOMINATED BY LARGE RELATIVELY SOPHISTICATED REPTILES AND RELATIVELY MODERN PLANTS.
THE UPPER YOUNGEST BOUNDARY IS SET AT A MAJOR EXTINCTION EVENT 250 MILLION YEARS LATER KNOWN AS THE PERMIAN TRIASSIC EXTINCTION EVENT. MODERN PRACTICE SETS THE OLDER BOUNDARY AT THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF A DISTINCTIVE TRACE FOSSIL CALLED PHYCODES PEDUM.
GEOLOGICALLY THE PALEOZOIC STARTS SHORTLY AFTER THE BREAKUP OF A SUPERCONTINENT CALLED RODINIA AND AT THE END OF A GLOBAL ICE AGE SNOWBALL EARTH. THROUGHOUT THE EARLY PALAEOZOIC THE EARTH S LANDMASS WAS BROKEN UP INTO A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF RELATIVELY SMALL CONTINENTS. TOWARD THE END OF THE ERA THE CONTINENTS GATHERED TOGETHER INTO A SUPERCONTINENT CALLED PANGAEA WHICH INCLUDED MOST OF THE EARTH S LAND AREA.
AT THE START OF THE ERA LIFE WAS CONFINED TO BACTERIA ALGAE SPONGES AND A VARIETY OF SOMEWHAT ENIGMATIC FORMS KNOWN COLLECTIVELY AS THE EDIACARAN FAUNA. A LARGE NUMBER OF BODY PLANS APPEARED NEARLY SIMULTANEOUSLY AT THE START OF THE ERA A PHENOMENON KNOWN AS THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION.
THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT SIMPLE LIFE MAY ALREADY HAVE INVADED THE LAND AT THE START OF THE PALAEOZOIC BUT SUBSTANTIAL PLANTS AND ANIMALS DID NOT TAKE TO THE LAND UNTIL THE SILURIAN AND DID NOT THRIVE UNTIL THE DEVONIAN. ALTHOUGH PRIMITIVE VERTEBRATES ARE KNOWN NEAR THE START OF THE PALAEOZOIC ANIMAL FORMS WERE DOMINATED BY INVERTEBRATES UNTIL THE MID PALAEOZOIC. FISH POPULATIONS EXPLODED IN THE DEVONIAN. DURING THE LATE PALAEOZOIC GREAT FORESTS OF PRIMITIVE PLANTS THRIVED ON LAND FORMING THE GREAT COAL BEDS OF EUROPE AND EASTERN NORTH AMERICA. BY THE END OF THE ERA THE FIRST LARGE SOPHISTICATED REPTILES AND THE FIRST MODERN PLANTS CONIFERS HAD DEVELOPED.
THE MESOZOIC COVERS THE TIME WHEN LIFE WAS DOMINATED BY LARGE SOPHISTICATED REPTILES. THE LOWER OLDEST BOUNDARY IS SET BY THE P TR EXTINCTION EVENT. THE UPPER YOUNGEST BOUNDARY IS SET AT THE K T EXTINCTION EVENT.
GEOLOGICALLY THE MESOZOIC STARTS WITH ALMOST ALL THE EARTH S LAND COLLECTED INTO A SUPERCONTINENT CALLED PANGAEA. DURING THE ERA PANGAEA SPLIT INTO THE NORTHERN CONTINENT LAURASIA AND THE SOUTHERN CONTINENT GONDWANA. LAURASIA THEN SPLIT INTO NORTH AMERICA AND EURASIA. GONDWANA BROKE UP PROGRESSIVELY INTO CONTINENTS SOUTH AMERICA AFRICA MADAGASCAR INDIA AUSTRALIA AND ANTARCTICA.
THE MESOZOIC IS KNOWN AS THE AGE OF DINOSAURS. IT ALSO SAW THE DEVELOPMENT OF EARLY BIRDS AND MAMMALS AND LATER FLOWERING PLANTS ANGIOSPERMS. AT THE END OF THE MESOZOIC ALL THE MAJOR BODY PLANS OF MODERN LIFE WERE IN PLACE THOUGH IN SOME CASES NOTABLY THE MAMMALS THE FORMS THAT EXISTED AT THE END OF THE CRETACEOUS WERE RELATIVELY PRIMITIVE.
THE CENOZOIC IS THE AGE OF MAMMALS. DURING THE CENOZOIC MAMMALS DIVERGED FROM A FEW SMALL SIMPLE GENERALIZED FORMS INTO A DIVERSE COLLECTION OF TERRESTRIAL MARINE AND FLYING ANIMALS. FLOWERING PLANTS AND BIRDS ALSO EVOLVED SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE CENOZOIC.
GEOLOGICALLY THE CENOZOIC IS THE ERA WHEN CONTINENTS MOVED INTO THEIR CURRENT POSITIONS. AFRICA AND AUSTRALASIA SPLIT FROM GONDWANA TO DRIFT NORTH AND INDIA COLLIDED WITH SOUTHEAST ASIA ANTARCTICA MOVED INTO ITS CURRENT POSITION OVER THE SOUTH POLE THE ATLANTIC OCEAN WIDENED AND LATE IN THE ERA SOUTH AMERICA BECAME ATTACHED TO NORTH AMERICA.
HORMONE
HORMONES ARE THE CHEMICAL MESSENGERS OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM. HORMONES ARE THE SIGNALS WHICH ADJUST THE BODY S INTERNAL WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. EVERY MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM HAS HORMONES. THE CELLS WHICH REACT TO A GIVEN HORMONE HAVE SPECIAL RECEPTORS FOR THAT HORMONE. WHEN A HORMONE ATTACHES TO THE RECEPTOR PROTEIN A MECHANISM FOR SIGNALLING IS STARTED. THE CELL OR TISSUE THAT GETS THE MESSAGE IS CALLED THE TARGET. HORMONES ONLY ACT ON CELLS WHICH HAVE THE RIGHT RECEPTORS.
MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF CELLS CAN SEND A MESSAGE. THERE ARE SOME KINDS OF CELLS WHOSE MAIN JOB IS TO MAKE HORMONES. WHEN MANY OF THESE CELLS ARE TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE IT IS CALLED A GLAND. GLANDS ARE GROUPS OF CELLS THAT MAKE SOMETHING AND RELEASE IT PUT IT OUTSIDE THE CELL. MANY GLANDS MAKE HORMONES.
ENDOCRINE MEANS SECRETING DIRECTLY INTO THE BLOOD. MOST INTERNAL SECRETIONS ARE ENDOCRINE FROM ENDOCRINE GLANDS. THE OPPOSITE WORD IS EXOCRINE WHICH MEANS SECRETING THROUGH A DUCT OR TUBE. SOME HORMONES ARE PRODUCED BY EXOCRINE GLANDS AND SOME EXOCRINE SECRETIONS GO OUTSIDE THE BODY. SWEAT GLANDS AND SALIVARY GLANDS ARE EXAMPLES OF EXOCRINE GLANDS WHOSE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED OUTSIDE THE BODY.
HORMONES DO MANY THINGS. THEY REGULATE METABOLISM. METABOLISM IS ALL OF THE CHEMICAL AND ENERGY REACTIONS THAT HAPPEN IN A LIVING THING. HORMONES CAUSE THE GROWTH AND DEATH OF CELLS AND OF WHOLE ORGANISMS. HORMONES ALSO START AND CONTROL SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE THE HORMONES ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE MAKE GIRLS GO THROUGH PUBERTY. HORMONES HELP KEEP HOMEOSTASIS IN AN ORGANISM. HOMEOSTASIS MEANS TO KEEP A CONSTANT STATE INSIDE THE BODY LIKE TEMPERATURE AMOUNT OF WATER AND SALTS AND AMOUNT OF SUGAR. HORMONES RELEASED BY ONE GLAND CAN ALSO TELL OTHER GLANDS TO MAKE DIFFERENT HORMONES.
THERE ARE FOUR TYPES OF HORMONES IN MOST VERTEBRATES. THEY ARE GROUPED BY THE CHEMICALS FROM WHICH THEY ARE MADE. 
IN BIOLOGY REGULATION MEANS TO CONTROL SOMETHING. SO REGULATING HORMONES MEANS CONTROLLING HOW MUCH HORMONES ARE MADE AND RELEASED FROM CELLS.
HORMONE REGULATION IS MOSTLY DONE BY NEGATIVE FEEDBACK. IN NEGATIVE FEEDBACK A HORMONE CAUSES AN EFFECT. THE CELLS THAT MAKE THE HORMONE DETECT THIS EFFECT AND ITS PRODUCTION CEASES.
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF NEGATIVE FEEDBACK IS WITH THE HORMONE INSULIN. INSULIN IS PRODUCED BY THE PANCREAS. INSULIN IS RELEASED BY THE PANCREAS IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMPTION OF GLUCOSE. THE AMOUNT OF GLUCOSE IN THE BLOOD RISES AND THE PANCREAS DETECTS THIS INCREASE. IT THEN SECRETES INSULIN INTO THE BLOOD. INSULIN INCREASES GLUCOSE UPTAKE IN TARGET CELLS. SOME GLUCOSE IS USED BY THE CELLS BUT SOME IS ALSO CONVERTED TO AND STORED IN THE FORM OF GLYCOGEN. GLUCOSE UPTAKE BY CELLS DECREASES BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS THIS DECREASE IS DETECTED BY THE PANCREAS AND IN RESPONSE IT STOPS SECRETING INSULIN IN TO THE BLOODSTREAM. AS INSULIN LEVELS IN THE BLOOD DECREASE AS DOES GLUCOSE UPTAKE BY CELLS.
THIS NEGATIVE FEEDBACK THEREFORE HELPS TO MAINTAIN NORMAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS AND PREVENTS EXTREME CHANGES.
THERE ARE THREE MAIN TYPES OF HORMONES STEROID HORMONES THESE ARE NON POLAR AND DO NOT NEED A RECEPTOR. THE OTHER IS PEPTIDE HORMONES. THE LAST IS TYROSINE DERIVATIVE HORMONES SUCH AS THE T3 AND T4 HORMONES PRODUCED BY THE THYROID.
SOMETIMES TWO OR MORE HORMONES CONTROL THE SAME THING. FOR EXAMPLE BLOOD GLUCOSE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO AN ORGANISM. SO IT IS NOT CONTROLLED BY JUST ONE HORMONE. OTHER HORMONES ALSO MAKE THE GLUCOSE LEVEL GO UP OR DOWN. IF THE GLUCOSE LEVEL GETS TOO LOW THE BODY RELEASES HORMONES THAT DO THE OPPOSITE OF INSULIN. THEY DO NOT TELL THE CELLS IN THE BODY TO TAKE UP GLUCOSE FROM THE BLOOD. THEY TELL THE CELLS TO PUT GLUCOSE BACK INTO THE BLOOD. THESE KIND OF HORMONES THAT WORK OPPOSITE OF OTHER HORMONES ARE CALLED COUNTER REGULATORY HORMONES. COUNTER REGULATORY HORMONES FOR INSULIN ARE GLUCAGON AND EPINEPHRINE.
MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN AN ORGANISM ARE KEPT IN HOMEOSTASIS BY NEGATIVE FEEDBACK AND COUNTER REGULATORY HORMONES. HOWEVER A FEW THINGS ARE CONTROLLED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. ONE RARE WAY IS POSITIVE FEEDBACK. IN NEGATIVE FEEDBACK THE HORMONE S EFFECT MAKES A GLAND STOP MAKING HORMONES. IN POSITIVE FEEDBACK THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS. THE EFFECT OF THE HORMONE TELLS THE GLAND TO MAKE EVEN MORE HORMONES.
AN EXAMPLE OF POSITIVE FEEDBACK IS THE HORMONE THAT CAUSES CHILDBIRTH WHEN BABIES ARE BORN. THE HORMONE THAT CAUSES THIS IS OXYTOCIN. THIS HORMONE IS MADE BY THE PITUITARY GLAND. WHEN THE BABY STARTS COMING OUT IT STRETCHES THE MUSCLE IN THE CERVIX THE BOTTOM OF THE UTERUS. NERVES IN THE CERVIX SEND A MESSAGE TO THE PITUITARY. THIS MESSAGE MAKES THE PITUITARY RELEASE MORE OXYTOCIN. THE OXYTOCIN THEN CAUSES THE MUSCLES OF THE UTERUS TO CONTRACT OR SQUEEZE. THIS CAUSES MORE STRETCHING IN THE CERVIX. THIS STRETCHING THEN TELLS THE PITUITARY TO MAKE EVEN MORE OXYTOCIN. SO LEVELS OF OXYTOCIN KEEP RISING UNTIL THE SQUEEZING OR CONTRACTIONS OF THE UTERUS FORCE THE BABY OUT.
THERE ARE CLEAR DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN HORMONES AND NEUROTRANSMITTERS 
MOST HORMONES START A CELLULAR RESPONSE BY BINDING TO CELL MEMBRANES OR RECEPTORS INSIDE THE CELL. A CELL MAY HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT RECEPTOR TYPES THAT RECOGNIZE THE SAME HORMONE BUT ACTIVATE DIFFERENT SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS OR A CELL MAY HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT RECEPTORS THAT RECOGNIZE DIFFERENT HORMONES AND ACTIVATE THE SAME BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAY.
HORMONES ARE DEFINED FUNCTIONALLY NOT STRUCTURALLY. THEY MAY HAVE VARIOUS CHEMICAL STRUCTURES. HORMONES OCCUR IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS PLANTS ANIMALS FUNGI BROWN ALGAE AND RED ALGAE. THESE COMPOUNDS OCCUR ALSO IN UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS AND MAY ACT AS SIGNALLING MOLECULES 
HYDROGEN
HYDROGEN IS A CHEMICAL ELEMENT. ITS ATOMIC NUMBER IS 1 WHICH MAKES IT THE SIMPLEST KNOWN ELEMENT IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. HYDROGEN IS THE TRUE PRIMORDIAL SUBSTANCE THE FIRST ATOM PRODUCED AFTER THE BIG BANG. ALL CHEMICAL ELEMENTS WERE FORMED FROM HYDROGEN BY THE PROCESSES OF NUCLEAR FUSION.
HYDROGEN GLOWS PURPLE WHEN IT IS IN PLASMA STATE.
IN ITS PURE FORM ON EARTH HYDROGEN IS USUALLY A GAS. HYDROGEN IS ALSO ONE OF THE PARTS THAT MAKE UP A WATER MOLECULE. HYDROGEN IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS THE FUEL THAT POWERS THE SUN AND OTHER STARS. 
HYDROGEN MAKES UP ABOUT 74 OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. HYDROGEN S SYMBOL ON THE PERIODIC TABLE OF ELEMENTS IS H.
PURE HYDROGEN IS NORMALLY MADE OF TWO HYDROGEN ATOMS CONNECTED TOGETHER. SCIENTISTS CALL THESE DIATOMIC MOLECULES. HYDROGEN WILL HAVE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHEN MIXED WITH MOST OTHER ELEMENTS. IT HAS NO COLOR OR SMELL. 
PURE HYDROGEN IS VERY UNCOMMON IN THE EARTH S ATMOSPHERE. IN NATURE IT IS USUALLY IN WATER. HYDROGEN IS ALSO IN ALL LIVING THINGS AS A PART OF THE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS THAT LIVING THINGS ARE MADE OF. IN ADDITION HYDROGEN ATOMS CAN COMBINE WITH CARBON ATOMS TO FORM HYDROCARBONS. PETROLEUM AND OTHER FOSSIL FUELS ARE MADE OF THESE HYDROCARBONS AND COMMONLY USED TO CREATE ENERGY FOR HUMAN USE.
HYDROGEN HAS TWO DIFFERENT ISOTOPES CALLED DEUTERIUM AND TRITIUM. LIKE REGULAR HYDROGEN THEY BOTH HAVE ONLY ONE PROTON AND ONE ELECTRON BUT DEUTERIUM ALSO HAS ONE NEUTRON AND TRITIUM HAS TWO. THESE OTHER TYPES OF HYDROGEN ARE IMPORTANT IN NUCLEAR ENERGY AND ORGANIC CHEMISTRY REACTIONS. 
SOME OTHER FACTS ABOUT HYDROGEN 
HYDROGEN WAS DISCOVERED IN 1671 BY ROBERT BOYLE EVEN THOUGH MANY PEOPLE THINK IT WAS DISCOVERED BY HENRY CAVENDISH IN 1776.
THE NAME HYDROGEN COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD FOR WATER PRONOUNCED HEEW DOR AND GENNEN MEANING TO GENERATE AS IT FORMS WATER IN A CHEMICAL REACTION WITH OXYGEN.
THE MAIN USES OF HYDROGEN ARE IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY AND IN MAKING AMMONIA BY THE HABER PROCESS. SOME IS USED ELSEWHERE IN THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY. A LITTLE OF IT IS USED AS FUEL FOR EXAMPLE IN ROCKETS FOR SPACECRAFT. MOST OF THE HYDROGEN THAT PEOPLE USE COMES FROM A CHEMICAL REACTION BETWEEN NATURAL GAS AND STEAM. 
NUCLEAR FUSION IS A VERY POWERFUL SOURCE OF ENERGY. IT RELIES ON FORCING ATOMS TOGETHER TO MAKE HELIUM AND ENERGY EXACTLY AS HAPPENS IN A STAR LIKE THE SUN OR IN A HYDROGEN BOMB. THIS NEEDS A LARGE AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO GET STARTED AND IS NOT EASY TO DO YET. A BIG ADVANTAGE OVER NUCLEAR FISSION WHICH IS USED IN TODAY S NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS IS THAT IT MAKES LESS NUCLEAR WASTE AND DOES NOT USE A TOXIC AND RARE FUEL LIKE URANIUM. MORE THAN 600 MILLION TONS OF HYDROGEN UNDERGO FUSION EVERY SECOND ON THE SUN.
THE ELECTROLYSIS OF WATER EASILY BREAKS WATER INTO HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN USING A LARGE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY. BURNING HYDROGEN COMBINES WITH OXYGEN MOLECULES TO MAKE STEAM PURE WATER VAPOR. A FUEL CELL COMBINES HYDROGEN WITH AN OXYGEN MOLECULE RELEASING AN ELECTRON AS ELECTRICITY. FOR THESE REASONS MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE HYDROGEN POWER WILL EVENTUALLY REPLACE TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS DIESEL ELECTRIC ENGINES AND BIODIESEL FUEL.
SOME PEOPLE THINK IT IS NOT CORRECT TO SEE HYDROGEN AS A FUEL IF IT IS USED IN A FUEL CELL. BECAUSE IT IS NOT FOUND NATURALLY ON EARTH IT IS MORE OF A REPLACEMENT FOR THE POWER GRID. SUCH A GRID AND INFRASTRUCTURE WITH NEW VEHICLES MIGHT BE FIRST MADE SOMEWHERE LIKE ICELAND A COUNTRY THAT HAS MUCH FREE GEOTHERMAL ENERGY AND IS QUITE SMALL. BECAUSE IT IMPORTS ALL FOSSIL FUEL IT WOULD HELP ICELAND TO COMPLETELY STOP USING IT. THE HUGE ADVANTAGE OF HYDROGEN IS THAT WHEN BURNT IN AN ENGINE OR IN A FUEL CELL THERE IS NO POLLUTION. ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER FORMS.
ILLEGAL DRUGS
ILLEGAL DRUGS ARE DRUGS WHICH HAVE LIMITATIONS ON THEIR OWNERSHIP OR USE BY A GOVERNMENT AND ARE ILLEGAL IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS MEANING A PERSON IS NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM. A DRUG IS ANY CHEMICAL THAT AFFECTS THE HUMAN BODY OR MIND WHEN IT IS SWALLOWED BREATHED IN OR CONSUMED IN ANOTHER WAY. A PSYCHOACTIVE DRUG IS A DRUG THAT AFFECTS THE BRAIN. MOST LAWS AGAINST DRUGS ARE AGAINST PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS.
SOME CONTROLLED DRUGS ARE ALLOWED IF YOU HAVE PERMISSION CALLED A PRESCRIPTION FROM DOCTOR. OTHER DRUGS ARE ILLEGAL MEANING YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM. INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES AND PLACES HAVE DIFFERENT LAWS ABOUT DIFFERENT DRUGS AND THERE ARE ALSO INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AGAINST SOME DRUGS. THE MOST USED DRUGS ARE NOT ILLEGAL FOR EXAMPLE TOBACCO.
THERE ARE MANY CATEGORIES TYPES OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS. THESE CATEGORIES HAVE SUBCATEGORIES CATEGORIES WITHIN CATEGORIES. FOR EXAMPLE BENZODIAZEPINES AND OPIATES ARE BOTH SUBCATEGORIES OF DEPRESSANTS. SOME DRUGS SUCH AS KETAMINE HAVE ELEMENTS OF TWO CATEGORIES HALLUCINOGENS AND DEPRESSANTS. EVERY DRUG IS DIFFERENT SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE EFFECTS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL DRUG NOT JUST THE GENERAL GROUP.
HALLUCINOGENS CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE SEE HEAR FEEL OR THINK. THE THREE MAIN GROUPS OF HALLUCINOGENS ARE PSYCHEDELICS DISSOCIATIVES AND DELIRIANTS. EACH GROUP HAS DIFFERENT EFFECTS. THEY MAY CAUSE HALLUCINATIONS WHEN A PERSON IMAGINES SOMETHING THAT IS NOT REALLY THERE.
STIMULANTS SPEED UP THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. PEOPLE USING STIMULANTS MAY FEEL HAPPY AND EXCITED AND HAVE MORE ENERGY CONCENTRATION OR MOTIVATION. STIMULANTS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SLEEP.
DEPRESSANTS ARE DRUGS WHICH SLOW DOWN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. PEOPLE USING DEPRESSANTS MAY FEEL HAPPY AND CONTENT AS WELL AS SLEEPY AND RELAXED. DEPRESSANTS OFTEN SLOW DOWN BODILY FUNCTIONS SUCH AS BREATHING AND HEART RATE AND MAY MAKE IT HARD TO SPEAK SLURRED SPEECH OR MOVE PROPERLY IN LARGE ENOUGH DOSES IN WHICH CASE THEY MAY BE HARMFUL. 
ANTIPSYCHOTICS ARE DRUGS WHICH BALANCE PEOPLE S MOODS OR STOP HALLUCINATIONS. MANY ANTI PSYCHOTICS ARE LEGAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG SUCH AS ANTI DEPRESSANTS WHICH ARE USED TO HELP TO STOP PEOPLE FEELING DEPRESSED.
PEOPLE MIGHT USE DRUGS AS MEDICINE IF THEY ARE SICK AND THE DRUGS HELP MAKE THEM BETTER. PEOPLE MIGHT ALSO USE DRUGS RECREATIONALLY TO HAVE FUN. THESE USUALLY ARE ILLEGAL DRUGS. SOME PEOPLE USE DRUGS TO MAKE THEMSELVES MORE PRODUCTIVE OR TO HELP THEMSELVES STAY AWAKE IN THIS CASE THEY WOULD USE A STIMULANT SUCH AS AMPHETAMINES OR CAFFEINE.
SOME PEOPLE USE DRUGS FOR SPIRITUAL OR RELIGIOUS REASONS SOME CHRISTIANS USE SMALL DOSES OF WINE ALCOHOL AS PART OF THEIR RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES AND MEMBERS OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN CHURCH USE PEYOTE A TYPE OF CACTUS THAT CONTAINS THE DRUG MESCALINE. SOME HINDUS USE CANNABIS A PLANT THAT CONTAINS TWO MAIN CHEMICALS CALLED THC AND CBD AS PART OF THEIR RELIGIOUS RITES.
SOME PEOPLE ALSO USE DRUGS BECAUSE THEY ARE ADDICTED. THIS WILL BE EXPLAINED FURTHER BELOW.
THE LAW IS DIFFERENT IN EACH COUNTRY. A DRUG CAN BE LEGAL IN ONE COUNTRY AND ILLEGAL IN ANOTHER. FOR INSTANCE IN ECUADOR CANNABIS IS LEGAL TO HAVE AND IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IT IS ILLEGAL TO HAVE CANNABIS IN MOST STATES. IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO HAVE ALCOHOL BUT IN THE UNITED STATES ADULTS ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE ALCOHOL. SOME DRUGS ARE ONLY LEGAL IF YOU HAVE PERMISSION CALLED A PRESCRIPTION OR RECOMMENDATION FROM A DOCTOR TO HAVE THEM AS MEDICINE. IF A PERSON IS CAUGHT BY THE POLICE WITH CONTROLLED DRUGS THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEY MAY BE TAKEN TO COURT AND GET FINED THEY HAVE TO PAY MONEY TO THE GOVERNMENT OR EVEN GO TO JAIL OR IN SOME COUNTRIES THEY MAY BE EXECUTED. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT THE LAW SAYS ABOUT DRUGS IN YOUR COUNTRY OR RELIGION STATE.
DRUGS CAN HAVE MANY DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON A PERSON S HEALTH. SOME DRUGS SUCH AS TOBACCO A PLANT THAT CONTAINS A DRUG CALLED NICOTINE AND ALCOHOL DIRECTLY CAUSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO DIE EVERY YEAR. OTHER DRUGS SUCH AS CANNABIS OR PSILOCYBIN MUSHROOMS SOMETIMES CALLED MAGIC MUSHROOMS CAUSE NO DEATHS. HOWEVER EVEN IF A DRUG DOESN T CAUSE ANY DEATHS DIRECTLY THERE ARE OTHER HEALTH EFFECTS TO BE AWARE OF. SOMEONE WHO HAS TAKEN A DRUG AND IS EXPERIENCING ITS EFFECTS IS SAID TO BE INTOXICATED. PEOPLE WHO ARE INTOXICATED MAY DO THINGS THEY OTHERWISE WOULD NOT DO AND THEY MAY BE UNABLE TO SAFELY DRIVE OR OPERATE MACHINERY. IF AN INTOXICATED PERSON DOES DRIVE A CAR VEHICLE OR OPERATE MACHINERY IT MAY CAUSE ACCIDENTS DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH OF THE DRUG THEY HAVE HAD AND HOW AFFECTED THEY ARE.
OVERDOSING IS WHEN A PERSON TAKES TOO MUCH OF A DRUG AT ONCE AND IT BECOMES VERY DANGEROUS FOR THEIR HEALTH THEY MIGHT EVEN DIE. SOME DRUGS SUCH AS HEROIN ALCOHOL AND ASPIRIN ARE EASY TO OVERDOSE ON WHILE OTHERS ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERDOSE ON LSD CANNABIS. MANY DRUGS CAN CAUSE LONG TERM HEALTH EFFECTS SEPARATE FROM JUST THEIR SHORT TERM EFFECTS FOR INSTANCE SMOKING TOBACCO CAN CAUSE CANCER AND ABUSING ALCOHOL CAN CAUSE LIVER DAMAGE.
MANY DRUGS ARE USED AS MEDICINE TO HELP MAKE SICK PEOPLE BETTER. FOR INSTANCE OPIATES LIKE MORPHINE HEROIN AND CODEINE ARE ANALGESICS PAIN KILLERS. NITROUS OXIDE AND KETAMINE ARE USED AS ANAESTHETICS TO PUT PEOPLE AND ANIMALS TO SLEEP DURING A SURGICAL OPERATION. AMPHETAMINES CAN EVEN BE LEGALLY PRESCRIBED BY A DOCTOR FOR ATTENTION DISORDERS IN SOME COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES.
USING TWO DRUGS TOGETHER CAN SOMETIMES CAUSE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE REACTIONS INCLUDING LIFE THREATENING ONES. GENERALLY IT IS BEST TO ASK A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL SUCH AS A DOCTOR BEFORE COMBINING TWO DRUGS.
ADDICTION IS WHEN A PERSON TAKES A DRUG CONSTANTLY BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY NEED IT AND FIND IT VERY HARD TO STOP. DEPENDENCE IS WHEN A PERSON S BODY ADAPTS TO A DRUG SO THAT THE BODY IS MORE RESISTANT AND STARTS CRAVING THE DRUG ALL THE TIME IF A DEPENDENT PERSON STOPS TAKING THAT DRUG THEY MAY FEEL VERY SICK OR RARELY EVEN DIE WITHOUT MEDICAL HELP. ADDICTION AND DEPENDENCE CAN HAPPEN SEPARATELY TO EACH OTHER AND PEOPLE CAN BE COME ADDICTED TO THINGS THAT ARE NOT DRUGS SUCH AS GAMBLING SEX OR JUST ABOUT ANY ACTIVITY. ADDICTION AND DEPENDENCE CAN SOMETIMES MAKE IT VERY HARD FOR A PERSON TO LIVE A NORMAL LIFE. SOME PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS ARE KNOWN TO BE VERY ADDICTIVE THEY OFTEN CAUSE ADDICTION SUCH AS ALCOHOL HEROIN TOBACCO METHAMPHETAMINE AND COCAINE WHEREAS OTHER DRUGS ARE KNOWN TO BE SLIGHTLY LESS ADDICTIVE SUCH AS KHAT CANNABIS AND CAFFEINE OR NOT ADDICTIVE AT ALL SUCH AS LSD AND PSILOCYBIN MUSHROOMS.
DRUGS LEGAL OR NOT MAY BE TAKEN MANY WAYS. DIFFERENT DRUGS CAN BE USED IN DIFFERENT WAYS DEPENDING ON THE DRUG. SOME DRUGS ARE AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT FORMS AND EACH FORM CAN ONLY BE USED A CERTAIN WAY FOR INSTANCE CRACK COCAINE COCAINE IN A BASE FORM IS MORE POWERFUL WHEN SMOKED OR VAPORIZED AND POWDER COCAINE COCAINE IN A SALT FORM IS USUALLY SNORTED. DRUGS CAN BE TAKEN 
ORALLY IS THE SLOWEST METHOD OF USING A DRUG AS IT MUST BE DIGESTED IN THE STOMACH FIRST. INJECTING A DRUG IV IS THE FASTEST AND THE MOST LIKELY TO LEAD TO AN OVERDOSE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS USE CLEAN NEEDLES WHEN INJECTING INJECTING WITH USED OR DIRTY NEEDLES CAN SPREAD DEADLY INFECTIONS SUCH AS HEPATITIS C OR HIV.
DEPENDING ON THE DRUG SMOKING CAN LEAD TO CANCER FOR INSTANCE SMOKING CAN CAUSE CANCER. SMOKING CAN ALSO SOMETIMES LEAD TO EMPHYSEMA A DISEASE OF THE LUNGS DEPENDING ON WHAT IS BEING SMOKED. INSUFFLATING A DRUG CAN LEAD TO EAR NOSE AND THROAT CONDITIONS DEPENDING ON THE DRUG BEING USED. EATING A DRUG CAN SOMETIMES CAUSE MOUTH RELATED PROBLEMS SUCH AS TOOTH DECAY.
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IS THE NAME HISTORIANS HAVE GIVEN TO THE PERIOD IN HISTORY WHEN THERE WAS A LARGE AND RAPID CHANGE IN THE WAY THINGS WERE MADE. THIS MEANT THAT INSTEAD OF THINGS BEING HAND MADE IN SMALL WORKSHOPS THEY WERE MADE IN LARGE QUANTITIES BY MACHINES IN FACTORIES. PRODUCTS BEING MADE IN LARGE QUANTITY NOW MEANT THAT THEY WERE SOLD FOR LESS.
MANY PEOPLE BEGAN TO MOVE FROM AN AGRICULTURAL BASED LIFE IN THE COUNTRY TO THE TOWNS WHERE THE FACTORIES OFFERED MORE AND BETTER PAID WORK.
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN GREAT BRITAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 18TH CENTURY. IN PARTICULAR THE COUNTY OF SHROPSHIRE WAS IMPORTANT FOR IT HAD BOTH MINERALS E.G. IRON ORE AND COAL AND TRANSPORT ON THE RIVER SEVERN. THIS LED TO THE GROUP OF INDUSTRIES NEAR THE IRONBRIDGE GORGE AND THE TOWN OF COALBROOKDALE.
THE REVOLUTION SPREAD TO EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS ESPECIALLY THE UNITED STATES BY THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY. SAMUEL SLATER WHO HAD BEEN AN APPRENTICE IN AN ENGLISH COTTON FACTORY DISGUISED HIMSELF AND CAME TO AMERICA. HE RECONSTRUCTED A SPINNING MACHINE FROM MEMORY AND BUILT A FACTORY OF HIS OWN. 
NEW IDEAS AND INVENTIONS WERE ALSO TAKEN UP AND USED IN MINING THE WORKING OF METALS AND IN THE TRANSPORT OF GOODS. AROUND THE SAME TIME NEW IDEAS IN FARMING WERE LEAVING SOME FARM WORKERS WITHOUT JOBS. THEY ADDED TO THE MOVE TO THE INDUSTRIAL TOWNS WHERE THEY SOUGHT OUT WORK IN FACTORIES. 
THE MOST IMPORTANT NEW INVENTION OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WAS THE STEAM ENGINE. THE STEAM ENGINE IMPROVED BY JAMES WATT AROUND 1776 WAS USED TO POWER THE FACTORIES AND PUMP OUT MINES. IT WAS ALSO USED IN LOCOMOTIVES AND STEAMBOATS. THE HEAT FROM BURNING COAL BECAME THE MAIN SOURCE OF POWER.
HISTORIANS STILL DISAGREE ON WHY THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION HAPPENED WHEN IT DID AND WHY IT HAPPENED IN ENGLAND FIRST. IT BUILT ON A NEW SPIRIT OF STUDYING THINGS THROUGH SCIENCE. THE 17TH CENTURY BEGAN A PERIOD NOW CALLED THE ENLIGHTENMENT DURING WHICH PEOPLE ASKED MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WAY THE WORLD WORKED. ENGLAND ALSO WAS A POLITICALLY STABLE COUNTRY THROUGHOUT THE 18TH CENTURY WITH NO WARS AT HOME ALTHOUGH IT HAD MANY ABROAD. ENGLAND ALSO HAD MANY OF THE RAW MATERIALS NEEDED TO MAKE AND POWER THE NEW MACHINES. IT ALSO HAD AN OVERSEAS EMPIRE THAT WOULD BUY THE GOODS IT MADE AND PROVIDE IT WITH A CHEAP SOURCE OF OTHER RAW MATERIALS SUCH AS COTTON AND SUGAR. AT THE TIME OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THE SLAVE TRADE WAS ABOLISHED BUT SLAVERY WAS STILL PRACTICED IN MANY BRITISH EMPIRE LANDS. THIS SUPPLIED A SOURCE FOR SOME OF THE MONEY WHICH COULD BE SPENT ON BUILDING THE NEW INDUSTRIES. ALSO ENGLAND HAD MUCH LESS LAND THAT COULD BE FARMED COMPARED TO OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
LIVING STANDARDS ROSE AND PEOPLE GENERALLY BECAME RICHER AND HEALTHIER AND HAD MORE CHILDREN WHO SURVIVED TO BE ADULTS INSTEAD OF STARVING. THE RESULTING POPULATION GROWTH IN ENGLAND CAUSED NEW PROBLEMS. THE ENVIRONMENT WAS DAMAGED. WHERE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE HAD BEEN RICH BECAUSE THEY OWNED LAND NOW MORE BECAME VERY RICH THANKS TO INDUSTRY. AS BEFORE HOWEVER MOST PEOPLE WERE POOR AND LIVED IN POOR CONDITIONS. CHILDREN AND WOMEN HAD TO WORK FOR A LONG TIME FOR LITTLE PAY. OFTEN SEVERAL FAMILIES CROWDED INTO VERY SMALL APARTMENTS. WORKING AT DIFFERENT TIMES FAMILY MEMBERS WOULD TAKE TURNS SLEEPING WHEN THEY WERE NOT WORKING. FAMILIES WERE USUALLY UNABLE TO GET TOGETHER. 12 14 OR EVEN 18 HOUR WORKDAYS WERE COMMON. THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BROUGHT PROBLEMS OF ITS OWN.
DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION NEW TECHNOLOGY BROUGHT MANY CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE 
INFINITY
INFINITY IS ABOUT THINGS WHICH NEVER END. SOMETIMES IT IS ALSO WRITTEN FORMULA 1. INFINITY MEANS MANY DIFFERENT THINGS DEPENDING ON WHEN IT IS USED. THE WORD IS FROM A LATIN WORD WHICH MEANS WITHOUT END. INFINITY GOES ON FOREVER SO SOMETIMES SPACE NUMBERS AND OTHER THINGS ARE SAID TO BE INFINITE BECAUSE THEY NEVER COME TO A STOP.
INFINITY IS NOT REALLY AN ORDINARY NUMBER BUT IT IS SOMETIMES USED AS ONE. INFINITY OFTEN SAYS HOW MANY THERE IS OF SOMETHING INSTEAD OF HOW BIG SOMETHING IS. FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE INFINITELY MANY WHOLE NUMBERS CALLED INTEGERS BUT THERE IS NO INTEGER WHICH IS INFINITELY BIG. BUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF MATH HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF INFINITY. SO ITS MEANING OFTEN CHANGES.
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF INFINITY POTENTIAL INFINITY AND ACTUAL INFINITY. POTENTIAL INFINITY IS A PROCESS THAT NEVER STOPS. FOR EXAMPLE ADDING 10 TO A NUMBER. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES 10 IS ADDED 10 MORE CAN STILL BE ADDED. ACTUAL INFINITY IS A MORE ABSTRACT IDEA. FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE INFINITELY MANY NUMBERS AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WRITE THEM ALL DOWN.
MATHEMATICIANS HAVE DIFFERENT SIZES OF INFINITY AND THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF INFINITY.
THE NUMBER OF THINGS BEGINNING WITH 0 1 2 3... TO INCLUDE INFINITE CARDINAL NUMBERS. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT CARDINAL NUMBERS. INFINITY CAN BE DEFINED IN ONE OF TWO WAYS INFINITY IS A NUMBER SO BIG THAT A PART OF IT CAN BE OF THE SAME SIZE INFINITY IS LARGER THAN ALL OF THE NATURAL NUMBERS. THERE IS A SMALLEST INFINITE NUMBER COUNTABLE INFINITY. IT IS THE COUNTING NUMBER FOR ALL OF THE WHOLE NUMBERS. IT IS ALSO THE COUNTING NUMBER OF THE RATIONAL NUMBERS. THE MATHEMATICAL NOTATION IS THE HEBREW LETTER ALEPH WITH A SUBSCRPT ZERO FORMULA 2. IT IS SPOKEN ALEPH NULL. 
IT WAS A SURPRISE TO LEARN THAT THERE ARE LARGER INFINITE NUMBERS. THE NUMBER OF REAL NUMBERS THAT IS ALL NUMBERS WITH DECIMALS IS LARGER THAN THE NUMBER OF RATIONAL NUMBERS THE NUMBER OF FRACTIONS. THIS SHOWS THAT THERE ARE REAL NUMBERS WHICH ARE NOT FRACTIONS. THE SMALLEST INFINITE NUMBER GREATER THAN FORMULA 2 IS FORMULA 4. 
THE NUMBER OF MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS IS THE NEXT INFINITE CARDINAL NUMBER FORMULA 5.
AND THESE NUMBERS GO ON WITHOUT END.
A DIFFERENT TYPE OF INFINITY ARE THE ORDINAL NUMBERS BEGINNING FIRST SECOND THIRD.... THE ORDER FIRST SECOND THIRD... AND SO ON TO INFINITY IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ORDER ENDING... THIRD SECOND FIRST. THE DIFFERENCE IS IMPORTANT FOR MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION. THE SIMPLE FIRST SECOND THIRD... HAS THE MATHEMATICAL NAME THE GREEK LETTER OMEGA WITH SUBSCRIPT ZERO FORMULA 6. OR SIMPLY OMEGA FORMULA 7. THE INFINITE SERIES ENDING... THIRD SECOND FIRST IS FORMULA 8.
THE THIRD TYPE OF INFINITY HAS THE SYMBOL FORMULA 1. THIS IS TREATED AS ADDITION TO THE REAL NUMBERS OR THE COMPLEX NUMBERS. IT IS THE RESULT OF DIVISION BY ZERO OR TO INDICATE THAT A SERIES IS INCREASING OR DECREASING WITHOUT BOUND. THE SERIES 1 2 3... INCREASES WITHOUT UPPER BOUND. THIS IS WRITTEN THE LIMIT IS FORMULA 10. IN CALCULUS THE INTEGRAL OVER ALL REAL NUMBERS IS WRITTEN FORMULA 11
EACH KIND OF INFINITY HAS DIFFERENT RULES.
FORMULA 12 ADDITION WITH ALEPHS IS COMMUTATIVE.
FORMULA 13 MULTIPLICATION WITH ALEPHS IS COMMUTATIVE.
FORMULA 14
FORMULA 15.
FORMULA 16. ADDITION WITH OMEGAS IS NOT COMMUTATIVE.
FORMULA 17. MULTIPLICATION WITH OMEGAS IS NOT COMMUTATIVE.
FORMULA 18
FORMULA 19
FORMULA 20 OTHERWISE DIVISION BY INFINITY IS NOT MEANINGFUL. SUBTRACTION WITH INFINITY IS NOT MEANINGFUL.
INSECT
INSECTS ARE A CLASS IN THE PHYLUM ARTHROPODA. THEY ARE SMALL TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES WHICH HAVE A HARD EXOSKELETON. 
INSECTS ARE THE LARGEST GROUP OF ANIMALS ON EARTH BY FAR ABOUT 926 400 DIFFERENT SPECIES HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED. THEY ARE MORE THAN HALF OF ALL KNOWN LIVING SPECIES. THEY MAY BE OVER 90 OF ANIMAL SPECIES ON EARTH.
NEW SPECIES OF INSECTS ARE CONTINUALLY BEING FOUND. ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SPECIES RANGE FROM 2 MILLION TO 30 MILLION.
INSECTS HAVE SIX LEGS AND MOST HAVE WINGS. INSECTS WERE THE FIRST ANIMALS CAPABLE OF FLIGHT. 
AS THEY DEVELOP FROM EGGS INSECTS UNDERGO METAMORPHOSIS. INSECTS LIVE ALL OVER THE PLANET ALMOST ALL ARE TERRESTRIAL LIVE ON LAND. FEW INSECTS LIVE IN THE OCEANS OR IN VERY COLD PLACES SUCH AS ANTARCTICA. THE MOST SPECIES LIVE IN TROPICAL AREAS.
SOME PEOPLE CALL ALL INSECTS BUGS BUT THIS IS NOT CORRECT. ONLY SOME INSECTS ARE TRUE BUGS WHICH IS A PARTICULAR ORDER OF INSECTS. PEOPLE WHO STUDY INSECTS ARE CALLED ENTOMOLOGISTS.
INSECTS HAVE EXOSKELETONS SKELETONS ON THE OUTSIDE. THEIR SKELETONS ARE MADE OUT OF THIN HARD PIECES OR PLATES LIKE ARMOUR MADE OF CHITIN. ALL TOGETHER THESE PIECES MAKE A HARD LAYER AROUND THE INSECT S BODY. THE EXOSKELETON PROTECTS THE INSECT. 
THE BODY OF AN INSECT HAS THREE MAIN PARTS A HEAD A THORAX AND AN ABDOMEN. ON THE HEAD ARE AN INSECT S COMPOUND EYES ITS TWO ANTENNAE THEY FEEL AND SMELL THINGS AND ITS MOUTH. 
ON THE THORAX INSECTS HAVE WINGS AND LEGS. ALL INSECTS HAVE SIX LEGS THREE PAIRS OF JOINTED LEGS AND USUALLY FOUR WINGS TWO PAIRS. 
THE ABDOMEN IS THE BACK PART OF THE INSECT. INSIDE THE ABDOMEN IS THE STOMACH THE HEART AND THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM WHERE BODY WASTES PASS OUT OF THE INSECT. BEES ALSO HAVE A STINGER AT THE BACK OF THE ABDOMEN.
JUST LIKE OUR MUSCLES CONNECT TO OUR BONES TO MAKE US WALK AND STAND UP THE MUSCLES OF AN INSECT CONNECT TO THE EXOSKELETON TO MAKE IT WALK AND MOVE. THEIR MUSCLES ARE ON THE INSIDE OF THEIR SKELETON.
INSECTS ARE COLD BLOODED WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CANNOT CONTROL THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE. THIS MEANS THAT INSECTS ARE NOT GOOD AT SURVIVING THE COLD AT ANY RATE OUT IN THE OPEN. IN THE WINTER MANY INSECTS GO INTO SOMETHING CALLED DIAPAUSE WHICH IS THE INSECT VERSION OF HIBERNATION. SOME INSECTS LIKE COCKROACHES CANNOT GO INTO DIAPAUSE AND THEY WILL DIE IF IT GETS TOO COLD OUTSIDE. THIS IS WHY COCKROACHES LOVE LIVING IN PEOPLE S WARM HOUSES.
INSECT RESPIRATION HAPPENS WITHOUT LUNGS. THERE IS A SYSTEM OF INTERNAL TUBES AND SACS THROUGH WHICH GASES DIFFUSE OR ARE ACTIVELY PUMPED. AIR IS TAKEN IN THROUGH OPENINGS ON THE SIDES OF THE ABDOMEN CALLED SPIRACLES. OXYGEN GETS TO TISSUES THAT NEED IT THROUGH THEIR TRACHEA ELEMENT 8 IN DIAGRAM. 
MANY INSECT LARVAE LIVE IN WATER. MANY OF THOSE HAVE GILLS THAT CAN EXTRACT OXYGEN DISSOLVED IN WATER. OTHERS MUST RISE TO THE WATER SURFACE TO GET AIR WHICH MAY BE HELD OR TRAPPED IN SPECIAL PARTS OF THEIR BODY.
ADULT INSECTS USE OXYGEN AT A HIGH RATE WHEN THEY FLY. THEY NEED IT FOR THE FLIGHT MUSCLES THE MOST ACTIVE TISSUE KNOWN IN BIOLOGY. THE FLIGHT MUSCLES USE OXYGEN AT A HUGE RATE 100 CCS OF OXYGEN FOR EVERY SINGLE CC OF TISSUE PER HOUR. WITH THIS SYSTEM THE GREATEST DIAMETER A MUSCLE COULD HAVE AND STILL CONSUME OXYGEN AT THIS RATE IS ABOUT 0.5CM. EVEN WITH SPECIAL EXTRA ARRANGEMENTS INSECTS CANNOT GET LARGER THAN ABOUT 11CM LONG. THE LARGEST INSECT BODIES ARE ABOUT AS BIG AS A MOUSE.
SOME INSECTS ALSO USE A MOLECULE CALLED HAEMOCYANIN WHICH DOES THE SAME JOB AS HAEMOGLOBIN DOES IN VERTEBRATES BUT LESS EFFICIENTLY. THE INSECT CIRCULATORY SYSTEM HAS NO VEINS OR ARTERIES. THE BLOOD IS CALLED HAEMOLYMPH AND MOVES AROUND IN THE SPACE CALLED THE HAEMOCOEL. THE ORGANS SIT IN THE HAEMOCOEL AND ARE BATHED IN THE HAEMOLYMPH. THE HEART IS LITTLE MORE THAN A SINGLE TUBE WHICH PULSES SQUEEZES.
INSECTS START LIFE AS AN EGG. USUALLY A FEMALE MOTHER INSECT LAYS EGGS BUT A FEW SPECIES HAVE LIVE BIRTH THE EGGS DEVELOP INSIDE THE MOTHER. THE EGGS ARE SMALL BUT THEY CAN USUALLY BE SEEN WITH THE NAKED EYE. 
ALTHOUGH THE ADULTS ARE LARGER THEY DO NEED A MAGNIFYING GLASS OR A BINOCULAR MICROSCOPE TO SEE THE DETAILS. A PROFESSIONAL ENTOMOLOGIST USES A BINOCULAR MICROSCOPE TO IDENTIFY INSECTS PLUS A PRINTED REFERENCE WORK. THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY INSECTS FOR ANYONE TO REMEMBER THEM ALL AND MOST ENTOMOLOGISTS SPECIALISE IN JUST ONE OR TWO ORDERS.
AFTER THE EGGS HATCH TWO KINDS OF DEVELOPMENT MAY OCCUR. SOME INSECTS HAVE WHAT IS CALLED INCOMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS. THIS MEANS THAT A SMALL INSECT CALLED A NYMPH COMES OUT OF THE EGG AND THE NYMPH LOOKS ALMOST THE SAME AS THE ADULT INSECT. AS THE NYMPH GROWS IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE WAY IT LOOKS BUT ONLY HOW BIG IT IS. IT GOES THROUGH A NUMBER OF STAGES CALLED INSTARS. GRASSHOPPERS GROW IN THIS WAY.
OTHER INSECTS HAVE COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS WHICH MEANS THAT THE SMALL LARVA WHICH COMES OUT OF THE EGG LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ADULT INSECT. INSECTS THAT HAVE COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS USUALLY COME OUT OF THE EGG AS A LARVA WHICH USUALLY LOOKS LIKE A WORM. THE LARVA EATS FOOD AND GETS BIGGER UNTIL IT TURNS INTO A PUPA. BUTTERFLY PUPAE PLURAL FOR PUPA ARE OFTEN INSIDE COCOONS. INSIDE THE COCOON THE INSECT CHANGES THE WAY IT LOOKS AND OFTEN GROWS WINGS. WHEN THE COCOON OPENS THE ADULT INSECT COMES OUT. MANY INSECTS HAVE COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS FOR EXAMPLE BEETLES BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS AND FLIES. THE ADULT STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT IS CALLED THE IMAGO.
THE OLDEST KNOWN INSECT FOSSIL IS THE DEVONIAN RHYNIOGNATHA FROM THE 396 MILLION YEAR OLD RHYNIE CHERT. IT MAY HAVE SUPERFICIALLY RESEMBLED A MODERN DAY SILVERFISH INSECT. THIS SPECIES ALREADY POSSESSED MANDIBLES OF A TYPE ASSOCIATED WITH WINGED INSECTS SUGGESTING THAT WINGS MAY ALREADY HAVE EVOLVED AT THIS TIME. THUS THE FIRST INSECTS PROBABLY APPEARED EARLIER IN THE SILURIAN PERIOD.
IN 2008 RESEARCHERS UNCOVERED WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS THE WORLD S OLDEST KNOWN FULL BODY IMPRESSION OF A PRIMITIVE FLYING INSECT A 300 MILLION YEAR OLD SPECIMEN FROM THE CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD.
THE ORIGINS OF INSECT FLIGHT REMAIN OBSCURE SINCE THE EARLIEST WINGED INSECTS CURRENTLY KNOWN APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CAPABLE FLIERS. SOME EXTINCT INSECTS HAD AN ADDITIONAL PAIR OF WINGLETS ATTACHING TO THE FIRST SEGMENT OF THE THORAX FOR A TOTAL OF THREE PAIRS. IT SEEMS THE INSECTS WERE NOT A PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL GROUP OF ANIMALS BEFORE THEY EVOLVED WINGS.
UPPER CARBONIFEROUS AND LOWER PERMIAN INSECT ORDERS INCLUDE BOTH LIVING GROUPS AND A NUMBER OF PALAEOZOIC GROUPS NOW EXTINCT. DURING THIS ERA SOME GIANT DRAGONFLY LIKE FORMS REACHED WINGSPANS OF MAKING THEM FAR LARGER THAN ANY LIVING INSECT. 
THIS GIGANTISM MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO HIGHER ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN LEVELS WHICH ALLOWED INCREASED RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY. THE LACK OF FLYING VERTEBRATES COULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER FACTOR. MANY OF THE EARLY GROUPS BECAME EXTINCT DURING THE PERMIAN TRIASSIC EXTINCTION EVENT THE LARGEST MASS EXTINCTION IN THE HISTORY OF THE EARTH AROUND 252 MILLION YEARS AGO.
DIFFERENT KINDS OF INSECTS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO GROUPS CALLED ORDERS. THERE ARE MANY INSECT ORDERS. THE BIGGEST INSECT ORDERS ARE LISTED BELOW 
SPIDERS SCORPIONS AND SIMILAR ANIMALS ARE NOT INSECTS THEY ARE ARACHNIDS. ARACHNIDS ARE ARTHROPODS THAT HAVE FOUR PAIRS OF LEGS. CENTIPEDES ARE ALSO ARTHROPODS BUT NOT INSECTS THEY ARE IN A SUBPHYLUM CALLED THE MYRIAPODA.
THIS TAXONOMY LISTS SOME OF THE BETTER KNOWN GROUPS OF INSECTS.
PESTS CAN BE HARMFUL TO PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. SOME ARE PARASITES SUCH AS LICE AND BED BUGS. SOME OF THESE PARASITE INSECTS CAN SPREAD DISEASES SUCH AS MOSQUITOES SPREADING MALARIA. 
OTHER PEST INSECTS DO NOT DIRECTLY HURT PEOPLE. TERMITES AND SOME BEETLES EAT WOOD AND SOMETIMES EAT BUILDINGS SUCH AS HOUSES. HOWEVER TERMITES ALSO HELP BREAK DOWN THE TREES AND BRANCHES THAT FALL ON THE FOREST FLOOR. MANY INSECTS EAT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS PLANTS MEANT FOR PEOPLE TO EAT. GRASSHOPPERS ARE ONE EXAMPLE OF PEST INSECTS THAT EAT PLANTS IN AGRICULTURE.
SOME INSECTS ARE USEFUL TO US. BEES MAKE HONEY. THE LARVAE OF SOME MOTHS MAKE SILK WHICH PEOPLE USE TO MAKE CLOTHING. IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD PEOPLE ACTUALLY EAT INSECTS. EATING INSECTS FOR FOOD IS CALLED ENTOMOPHAGY.
MANY BEES AND FLIES POLLINATE PLANTS. THIS MEANS THE INSECTS HELP THE PLANTS MAKE SEEDS BY MOVING POLLEN FROM ONE FLOWER TO ANOTHER. SOME GOOD INSECTS EAT PEST INSECTS SUCH AS LADY BEETLES OR LADYBIRDS OR LADYBUGS EATING APHIDS. MANY INSECTS EAT DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS. 
PEOPLE OFTEN USE POISONS CALLED INSECTICIDES TO KILL PEST INSECTS. INSECTICIDES DO NOT ALWAYS WORK. SOMETIMES THE PEST INSECTS BECOME RESISTANT TO THE INSECTICIDES WHICH MEANS THE INSECTICIDES DO NOT HURT THEM ANYMORE. BOTH THE COLORADO POTATO BEETLE AND THE DIAMONDBACK MOTH ARE INSECTS THAT ARE RESISTANT TO MANY INSECTICIDES. 
INSECTICIDES DO NOT ONLY KILL PEST INSECTS SOMETIMES MANY HELPFUL INSECTS ARE KILLED TOO. WHEN HELPFUL INSECTS ARE KILLED SUCH AS THOSE THAT EAT PEST INSECTS THE PEST INSECTS MAY COME BACK IN LARGER NUMBERS THAN BEFORE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT BEING EATEN BY HELPFUL INSECTS ANYMORE.
JULIUS CAESAR
GAIUS JULIUS CAESAR JULY 100 BC 15 MARCH 44 BC WAS A MILITARY COMMANDER POLITICIAN AND AUTHOR AT THE END OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC.
CAESAR BECAME A MEMBER OF THE FIRST TRIUMVIRATE AND WHEN THAT BROKE UP HE FOUGHT A CIVIL WAR AGAINST POMPEY THE GREAT. WINNING THE WAR CAESAR BECAME DICTATOR FOR LIFE OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC. HE WAS KILLED BY HIS ENEMIES IN ROME.
JULIUS CAESAR WAS BORN IN ITALY AROUND 13 JULY 100 BC. THE EXACT DATE IS NOT KNOWN. HE WAS BORN GAIUS JULIUS CAESARIUS.
AT SIXTEEN HE WAS THE HEAD OF HIS FAMILY AND SOON CAME UNDER THREAT AS LUCIUS CORNELIUS SULLA BECAME DICTATOR. 
SULLA SET ABOUT PURGING ROME OF HIS ENEMIES. HUNDREDS WERE KILLED OR EXILED AND CAESAR WAS ON THE LIST. HIS MOTHER S FAMILY PLEADED FOR HIS LIFE SULLA RELUCTANTLY GAVE IN BUT STRIPPED CAESAR OF HIS INHERITANCE. FROM THEN ON LACK OF MONEY WAS ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS IN HIS LIFE. CAESAR JOINED THE ARMY AND LEFT ROME.
ON THE WAY ACROSS THE AEGEAN SEA CAESAR WAS KIDNAPPED BY PIRATES AND HELD PRISONER. HE MAINTAINED AN ATTITUDE OF SUPERIORITY THROUGHOUT HIS CAPTIVITY. WHEN THE PIRATES THOUGHT TO DEMAND A RANSOM OF TWENTY TALENTS OF SILVER HE INSISTED THEY ASK FOR FIFTY. AFTER THE RANSOM WAS PAID CAESAR RAISED A FLEET PURSUED AND CAPTURED THE PIRATES AND IMPRISONED THEM. HE HAD THEM CRUCIFIED ON HIS OWN AUTHORITY AS HE HAD PROMISED WHILE IN CAPTIVITY A PROMISE THE PIRATES HAD TAKEN AS A JOKE. AS A SIGN OF LENIENCY HE FIRST HAD THEIR THROATS CUT. HE WAS SOON CALLED BACK INTO MILITARY ACTION. 
ON HIS RETURN TO ROME HE WAS ELECTED MILITARY TRIBUNE A FIRST STEP IN A POLITICAL CAREER. HE WAS ELECTED QUAESTOR FOR 69 BC. HIS WIFE CORNELIA DIED THAT YEAR. AFTER HER FUNERAL CAESAR WENT TO SERVE HIS QUAESTORSHIP IN SPAIN. ON HIS RETURN IN 67 BC HE MARRIED POMPEIA A GRANDDAUGHTER OF SULLA WHOM HE LATER DIVORCED. IN 63 BC HE RAN FOR ELECTION TO THE POST OF PONTIFEX MAXIMUS HIGH PRIEST OF THE ROMAN STATE RELIGION. HE RAN AGAINST TWO POWERFUL SENATORS THERE WERE ACCUSATIONS OF BRIBERY BY ALL SIDES. CAESAR WON COMFORTABLY DESPITE HIS OPPONENTS GREATER EXPERIENCE AND STANDING. 
AFTER HIS PRAETORSHIP CAESAR WAS APPOINTED TO GOVERN ROMAN SPAIN BUT HE WAS STILL IN CONSIDERABLE DEBT AND NEEDED TO SATISFY HIS CREDITORS. HE TURNED TO MARCUS LICINIUS CRASSUS ONE OF ROME S RICHEST MEN. IN RETURN FOR POLITICAL SUPPORT CRASSUS PAID SOME OF CAESAR S DEBTS AND ACTED AS GUARANTOR FOR OTHERS. CAESAR LEFT FOR HIS PROVINCE BEFORE HIS PRAETORSHIP HAD ENDED. IN SPAIN HE CONQUERED TWO LOCAL TRIBES WAS HAILED AS IMPERATOR BY HIS TROOPS AND COMPLETED HIS GOVERNORSHIP IN HIGH ESTEEM. THOUGH HE WAS DUE A TRIUMPH IN ROME HE ALSO WANTED TO STAND FOR CONSUL THE MOST SENIOR MAGISTRACY IN THE REPUBLIC. FACED WITH THE CHOICE BETWEEN A TRIUMPH AND THE CONSULSHIP CAESAR CHOSE THE CONSULSHIP. AFTER ELECTION HE WAS A CONSUL IN 59 BC.
CAESAR TOOK POWER WITH GNAEUS POMPEIUS MAGNUS POMPEY THE GREAT AND MARCUS LICINIUS CRASSUS. THESE THREE MEN RULED ROME AND WERE CALLED THE TRIUMVIRATE. 
CAESAR WAS THE GO BETWEEN FOR CRASSUS AND POMPEY. THEY HAD BEEN AT ODDS FOR YEARS BUT CAESAR TRIED TO RECONCILE THEM. BETWEEN THE THREE OF THEM THEY HAD ENOUGH MONEY AND POLITICAL INFLUENCE TO CONTROL PUBLIC BUSINESS. THIS INFORMAL ALLIANCE KNOWN AS THE FIRST TRIUMVIRATE RULE OF THREE MEN WAS CEMENTED BY THE MARRIAGE OF POMPEY TO CAESAR S DAUGHTER JULIA. CAESAR ALSO MARRIED AGAIN THIS TIME TO CALPURNIA WHO WAS THE DAUGHTER OF ANOTHER POWERFUL SENATOR. 
CAESAR PROPOSED A LAW FOR THE REDISTRIBUTION OF PUBLIC LANDS TO THE POOR A PROPOSAL SUPPORTED BY POMPEY BY FORCE OF ARMS IF NEED BE AND BY CRASSUS MAKING THE TRIUMVIRATE PUBLIC. POMPEY FILLED THE CITY WITH SOLDIERS AND THE TRIUMVIRATE S OPPONENTS WERE FRIGHTENED.
WITH THE AGREEMENT OF HIS PARTNERS CAESAR BECAME THE GOVERNOR OF GALLIA GAUL. GAUL IS THE AREA WHICH IS TODAY S NORTHERN ITALY SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. 
CAESAR WAS THE COMMANDER OF THE ROMAN LEGIONS DURING THE GALLIC WAR. THE WAR WAS FOUGHT ON THE SIDE OF ROME S GALLIC CLIENTS AGAINST THE GERMANS WHO WANTED TO INVADE GAUL. IT WAS ALSO TO EXTEND ROME S CONTROL OF GAUL. CAESAR S CONQUEST OF GAUL EXTENDED ROME S TERRITORY TO THE NORTH SEA. IN 55 BC HE CONDUCTED THE FIRST ROMAN INVASION OF BRITAIN. CAESAR WROTE ABOUT THIS EIGHT YEAR WAR IN HIS BOOK DE BELLO GALLICO ABOUT THE GALLIC WARS. THIS BOOK WRITTEN IN LATIN IS AN IMPORTANT HISTORICAL ACCOUNT. 
THESE ACHIEVEMENTS GOT HIM GREAT MILITARY POWER AND THREATENED TO ECLIPSE POMPEY. THE BALANCE OF POWER WAS FURTHER UPSET BY THE DEATH OF CRASSUS IN 53 BC.
IN 50 BC THE SENATE LED BY POMPEY ORDERED CAESAR TO DISBAND HIS ARMY AND RETURN TO ROME BECAUSE HIS TERM AS GOVERNOR HAD FINISHED. CAESAR THOUGHT HE WOULD BE PROSECUTED IF HE ENTERED ROME WITHOUT THE IMMUNITY ENJOYED BY A MAGISTRATE. POMPEY ACCUSED CAESAR OF INSUBORDINATION AND TREASON. 
CAESAR AND HIS ARMY APPROACHED ROME AND CROSSED THE RUBICON A SHALLOW RIVER IN NORTH EAST ITALY IN 49 BC. IT WAS THE POINT BEYOND WHICH NO ARMY WAS SUPPOSED TO GO. THE RIVER MARKED THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN CISALPINE GAUL TO THE NORTH AND ITALY PROPER TO THE SOUTH. CROSSING THE RUBICON CAUSED A CIVIL WAR. POMPEY THE LAWFUL CONSUL AND HIS FRIENDS FLED FROM ROME AS CAESAR S ARMY APPROACHED.
POMPEY MANAGED TO ESCAPE BEFORE CAESAR COULD CAPTURE HIM. CAESAR DECIDED TO HEAD FOR SPAIN WHILE LEAVING ITALY UNDER THE CONTROL OF MARK ANTONY. CAESAR MADE AN ASTONISHING 27 DAY ROUTE MARCH TO SPAIN WHERE HE DEFEATED POMPEY S LIEUTENANTS. HE THEN RETURNED EAST TO CHALLENGE POMPEY IN GREECE. THERE IN JULY 48 BC AT DYRRHACHIUM CAESAR BARELY AVOIDED A CATASTROPHIC DEFEAT. HE THEN DECISIVELY DEFEATED POMPEY AT THE BATTLE OF PHARSALUS LATER THAT YEAR.
IN ROME CAESAR WAS APPOINTED DICTATOR WITH MARK ANTONY AS HIS MASTER OF THE HORSE SECOND IN COMMAND. CAESAR PRESIDED OVER HIS OWN ELECTION TO A SECOND CONSULSHIP AND THEN AFTER ELEVEN DAYS RESIGNED THIS DICTATORSHIP.
LATE IN 48 BC HE WAS APPOINTED DICTATOR AGAIN WITH A TERM OF ONE YEAR. CAESAR THEN PURSUED POMPEY TO EGYPT WHERE POMPEY WAS SOON MURDERED. CAESAR THEN BECAME INVOLVED IN AN EGYPTIAN CIVIL WAR BETWEEN THE CHILD PHARAOH AND HIS SISTER WIFE AND CO REGENT QUEEN CLEOPATRA. PERHAPS AS A RESULT OF THE PHARAOH S ROLE IN POMPEY S MURDER CAESAR SIDED WITH CLEOPATRA. HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE WEPT AT THE SIGHT OF POMPEY S HEAD WHICH WAS OFFERED TO HIM BY THE PHARAOH AS A GIFT. IN ANY EVENT CAESAR DEFEATED THE PHARAOH S FORCES IN 47 BC AND INSTALLED CLEOPATRA AS RULER. 
CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA CELEBRATED THEIR VICTORY WITH A TRIUMPHANT PROCESSION ON THE NILE IN THE SPRING OF 47 B.C. THE ROYAL BARGE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY 400 ADDITIONAL SHIPS INTRODUCING CAESAR TO THE LUXURIOUS LIFESTYLE OF THE EGYPTIAN PHARAOHS. CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA NEVER MARRIED ROMAN LAW ONLY RECOGNIZED MARRIAGES BETWEEN TWO ROMAN CITIZENS. CAESAR CONTINUED HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH CLEOPATRA THROUGHOUT HIS LAST MARRIAGE WHICH LASTED 14 YEARS IN ROMAN EYES THIS DID NOT CONSTITUTE ADULTERY AND MAY HAVE FATHERED A SON CALLED CAESARION. CLEOPATRA VISITED ROME ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION STAYING IN CAESAR S VILLA OUTSIDE ROME ACROSS THE RIVER TIBER.
IN 46 BC CAESAR DEFEATED CATO AND THE REMNANTS OF POMPEY S SUPPORTERS IN AFRICA. HE WAS THEN APPOINTED DICTATOR FOR TEN YEARS. IN TWO YEARS HE MADE NUMEROUS CHANGES IN ROMAN ADMINISTRATION TO IMPROVE THE REPUBLIC. MANY OF THESE CHANGES WERE MEANT TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE. ONE EXAMPLE WHICH HAS LASTED WAS HIS REFORM OF THE CALENDAR INTO THE PRESENT FORMAT WITH A LEAP DAY EVERY FOUR YEARS. IN FEBRUARY OF 44 BC ONE MONTH BEFORE HIS ASSASSINATION HE WAS APPOINTED DICTATOR FOR LIFE.
ON THE IDES OF MARCH 15 MARCH OF 44 BC CAESAR WAS DUE TO APPEAR AT A SESSION OF THE SENATE. MARK ANTONY FEARING THE WORST WENT TO HEAD CAESAR OFF. THE PLOTTERS EXPECTED THIS AND ARRANGED FOR SOMEONE TO INTERCEPT HIM.
ACCORDING TO EUTROPIUS AROUND SIXTY OR MORE MEN PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSASSINATION. HE WAS STABBED 23 TIMES. ACCORDING TO SUETONIUS A PHYSICIAN LATER ESTABLISHED THAT ONLY ONE WOUND THE SECOND ONE TO HIS CHEST HAD BEEN LETHAL.
THE DICTATOR S LAST WORDS ARE NOT KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY AND ARE A CONTESTED SUBJECT AMONG SCHOLARS AND HISTORIANS ALIKE. THE VERSION BEST KNOWN IN THE ENGLISH SPEAKING WORLD IS THE LATIN PHRASE ET TU BRUTE YOU TOO BRUTUS. IN SHAKESPEARE S JULIUS CAESAR THIS IS THE FIRST HALF OF THE LINE ET TU BRUTE THEN FALL CAESAR.
ACCORDING TO PLUTARCH AFTER THE ASSASSINATION BRUTUS STEPPED FORWARD AS IF TO SAY SOMETHING TO HIS FELLOW SENATORS THEY HOWEVER FLED THE BUILDING. BRUTUS AND HIS COMPANIONS THEN MARCHED TO THE CAPITOL WHILE CRYING OUT TO THEIR BELOVED CITY PEOPLE OF ROME WE ARE ONCE AGAIN FREE. THEY WERE MET WITH SILENCE AS THE CITIZENS OF ROME HAD LOCKED THEMSELVES INSIDE THEIR HOUSES AS SOON AS THE RUMOUR OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE HAD BEGUN TO SPREAD. HE HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN MANY MANY MOVIES.
A WAX STATUE OF CAESAR WAS ERECTED IN THE FORUM DISPLAYING THE 23 STAB WOUNDS. A CROWD WHO HAD GATHERED THERE STARTED A FIRE WHICH BADLY DAMAGED THE FORUM AND NEIGHBOURING BUILDINGS. IN THE ENSUING CHAOS MARK ANTONY OCTAVIAN LATER AUGUSTUS CAESAR AND OTHERS FOUGHT A SERIES OF FIVE CIVIL WARS WHICH WOULD END IN THE FORMATION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.
THE ROMAN EMPIRE AND ITS EMPERORS WERE SO IMPORTANT IN HISTORY THAT THE WORD CAESAR WAS USED AS A TITLE IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO MEAN EMPEROR EVEN LONG AFTER THE ROMAN EMPIRE WAS GONE. FOR EXAMPLE GERMANY S EMPEROR WAS CALLED A KAISER UP TO THE YEAR 1919 CE AND RUSSIA S EMPEROR WAS CALLED A TSAR UNTIL THE YEAR 1917 CE.
CAESAR WAS A SIGNIFICANT AUTHOR. 
OTHER WORKS HISTORICALLY ATTRIBUTED TO CAESAR BUT WHOSE AUTHORSHIP IS DOUBTED ARE 
THESE NARRATIVES WERE WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED ON A YEARLY BASIS DURING OR JUST AFTER THE ACTUAL CAMPAIGNS AS A SORT OF DISPATCHES FROM THE FRONT. APPARENTLY SIMPLE AND DIRECT IN STYLE TO THE POINT THAT CAESAR S COMMENTARII ARE COMMONLY STUDIED BY FIRST AND SECOND YEAR LATIN STUDENTS THEY ARE IN FACT HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED TRACTS AIMED PARTICULARLY AT THE MIDDLE BROW READERSHIP OF MINOR ARISTOCRATS IN ROME ITALY AND THE PROVINCES.
BASED ON REMARKS BY PLUTARCH CAESAR IS SOMETIMES THOUGHT TO HAVE SUFFERED FROM EPILEPSY. MODERN SCHOLARSHIP IS DIVIDED ON THE SUBJECT. IT IS MORE CERTAIN THAT HE WAS PLAGUED BY MALARIA PARTICULARLY DURING THE SULLAN PROSCRIPTIONS OF THE 80S.
CAESAR HAD FOUR DOCUMENTED EPISODES OF WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN COMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURES. HE MAY ADDITIONALLY HAVE HAD ABSENCE SEIZURES PETIT MAL IN HIS YOUTH. THE EARLIEST ACCOUNTS OF THESE SEIZURES WERE MADE BY THE BIOGRAPHER SUETONIUS WHO WAS BORN AFTER CAESAR DIED. THE CLAIM OF EPILEPSY IS COUNTERED AMONG SOME MEDICAL HISTORIANS BY A CLAIM OF HYPOGLYCEMIA. THIS CAN CAUSE SEIZURES WHICH ARE A BIT LIKE EPILEPSY.
IN 2003 PSYCHIATRIST HARBOUR F. HODDER PUBLISHED WHAT HE TERMED AS THE CAESAR COMPLEX THEORY ARGUING THAT CAESAR WAS A SUFFERER OF TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY AND THAT THE SYMPTOMS WERE A FACTOR IN CAESAR S DECISION TO FORGO PERSONAL SAFETY IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO HIS ASSASSINATION.
LANGUAGE
LANGUAGE IS THE NORMAL WAY HUMANS COMMUNICATE. ONLY HUMANS USE LANGUAGE THOUGH OTHER ANIMALS COMMUNICATE THROUGH OTHER MEANS.
HUMAN LANGUAGE HAS SYNTAX A SET OF RULES FOR CONNECTING WORDS TOGETHER TO MAKE STATEMENTS AND QUESTIONS. LANGUAGE CAN ALSO BE CHANGED BY ADDING NEW WORDS FOR EXAMPLE TO DESCRIBE NEW THINGS. OTHER ANIMALS MAY INHERIT A SET OF CALLS WHICH HAVE PRE SET FUNCTIONS. 
LANGUAGE MAY BE DONE BY SPEECH OR BY WRITING OR BY MOVING THE HANDS TO MAKE SIGNS. IT FOLLOWS THAT LANGUAGE IS NOT JUST ANY WAY OF COMMUNICATING. EVEN SOME HUMAN COMMUNICATION IS NOT LANGUAGE SEE NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION. HUMANS ALSO USE LANGUAGE FOR THINKING.
LANGUAGE IS A WORD THAT MAY BE USED BY EXTENSION 
UNESCO SAYS THAT 2 500 LANGUAGES ARE AT RISK OF BECOMING EXTINCT.
ALL LANGUAGES SHARE CERTAIN THINGS WHICH SEPARATE THEM FROM ALL OTHER KINDS OF COMMUNICATION.
THERE ARE MANY MORE THINGS IN COMMON BETWEEN LANGUAGES.
THE CAPACITY TO LEARN AND USE LANGUAGE IS INHERITED. NORMALLY ALL HUMANS ARE BORN WITH THIS CAPABILITY. WHICH LANGUAGE IS LEARNED BY A CHILD DEPENDS ON WHICH LANGUAGE IS SPOKEN BY THE CHILD S COMMUNITY. THE CAPACITY IS INHERITED BUT THE PARTICULAR LANGUAGE IS LEARNED.
CHILDREN HAVE A SPECIAL PERIOD FROM ABOUT 18 MONTHS TO ABOUT FOUR YEARS WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR LEARNING THE LANGUAGE. IF THIS IS SERIOUSLY DISRUPTED THEN THEIR LANGUAGE SKILLS WILL BE DAMAGED. OLDER PEOPLE LEARN DIFFERENTLY SO THEY SELDOM LEARN A SECOND LANGUAGE AS WELL AS THEY LEARN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE.
MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE USE CREATED LANGUAGES CALLED FORMAL LANGUAGES LIKE COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES BUT THESE MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE LANGUAGES. MATHEMATICS ITSELF IS SEEN AS A LANGUAGE BY MANY. SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER MUSICAL NOTATION TO BE A WAY OF WRITING THE MUSICAL LANGUAGE.
CHINESE IS THE LANGUAGE WITH THE MOST NATIVE SPEAKERS IN THE WORLD BUT CHINESE IS NOT REALLY A LANGUAGE. IT IS A CLOSE FAMILY OF DIALECTS SOME OF WHICH ARE AS DIFFERENT AS ROMANCE LANGUAGES ARE FROM ONE ANOTHER.
ENGLISH IS OFTEN CALLED THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE OR LINGUA FRANCA. IT IS THE MAIN SECOND LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD AND THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE OF SCIENCE TRAVEL TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS DIPLOMACY AND ENTERTAINMENT. FRENCH HAD A SIMILAR STATUS UNTIL THE 20TH CENTURY AND OTHER LANGUAGES HAD IT AT OTHER TIMES.
SOME LANGUAGES ARE MADE UP SO THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD CAN LEARN THEM WITHOUT THE NEW LANGUAGES BEING TIED TO ANY SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR PLACE. THESE ARE CALLED CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGES. ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OF THESE LANGUAGES IS ESPERANTO WHICH IS SOMETIMES CALLED LA INTERNACIA LINGVO OR THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE. ANOTHER OF THESE LANGUAGES IS CALLED VOLAPUK WHICH WAS POPULAR ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO BUT IS MUCH LESS POPULAR NOW. IT HAS MOSTLY BEEN REPLACED BY LANGUAGES LIKE ESPERANTO INTERLINGUA AND IDO.
PART OF THE REASON THAT VOLAPUK BECAME UNPOPULAR IS THAT SOME SOUNDS ARE HARD TO SAY FOR PEOPLE WHO SPEAK SPANISH OR ENGLISH TWO OF THE MOST WIDELY SPOKEN LANGUAGES IN THE WORLD.
LAW
LAW IS A SET OF RULES DECIDED BY A PARTICULAR STATE MEANT FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING THE PEACE AND SECURITY OF SOCIETY. COURTS OR POLICE MAY ENFORCE THIS SYSTEM OF RULES AND PUNISH PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE LAWS SUCH AS BY PAYING A FINE OR OTHER PENALTY INCLUDING JAIL. IN ANCIENT SOCIETIES LAWS WERE WRITTEN BY LEADERS TO SET OUT RULES ON HOW PEOPLE CAN LIVE WORK AND DO BUSINESS WITH EACH OTHER. BUT MANY TIMES IN HISTORY WHEN LAWS HAVE BEEN ON A FALSE BASIS TO BENEFIT FEW AT THE EXPENSE OF SOCIETY THEY HAVE RESULTED IN CONFLICT. TO PREVENT THIS IN MOST COUNTRIES TODAY LAWS ARE WRITTEN AND VOTED ON BY GROUPS OF POLITICIANS IN A LEGISLATURE SUCH AS A PARLIAMENT OR CONGRESS ELECTED CHOSEN BY THE GOVERNED PEOPLES. COUNTRIES TODAY HAVE A CONSTITUTION FOR THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK OF SOCIETY AND MAKE FURTHER LAWS AS NEEDED FOR MATTERS OF DETAIL. MEMBERS OF SOCIETY GENERALLY HAVE ENOUGH FREEDOM WITHIN ALL THE LEGAL THINGS THEY CAN CHOOSE TO DO. AN ACTIVITY IS ILLEGAL IF IT BREAKS A LAW OR DOES NOT FOLLOW THE LAWS.
A LEGAL CODE IS A WRITTEN CODE OF LAWS THAT ARE ENFORCED. THIS MAY DEAL WITH THINGS LIKE POLICE COURTS OR PUNISHMENTS. A LAWYER JURIST OR ATTORNEY IS A PROFESSIONAL WHO STUDIES AND ARGUES THE RULES OF LAW. IN THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF ATTORNEYS TRANSACTIONAL ATTORNEYS WHO WRITE CONTRACTS AND LITIGATORS WHO GO TO COURT. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM THESE PROFESSIONALS ARE CALLED SOLICITORS AND BARRISTERS RESPECTIVELY. 
THE RULE OF LAW IS THE LAW WHICH SAYS THAT GOVERNMENT CAN ONLY LEGALLY USE ITS POWER IN A WAY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE AGREE ON. IT LIMITS THE POWERS A GOVERNMENT HAS AS AGREED IN A COUNTRY S CONSTITUTION. THE RULE OF LAW PREVENTS DICTATORSHIP AND PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE. WHEN LEADERS ENFORCE THE LEGAL CODE HONESTLY EVEN ON THEMSELVES AND THEIR FRIENDS THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW BEING FOLLOWED. THE RULE OF LAW WROTE THE ANCIENT GREEK PHILOSOPHER ARISTOTLE IN 350 BC IS BETTER THAN THE RULE OF ANY INDIVIDUAL. 
CULTURE IS USUALLY A MAJOR SOURCE OF THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND MANY LAWS AND PEOPLE ALSO TEND TO TRUST THE IDEAS BASED ON FAMILY AND SOCIAL HABITS. IN MANY COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT HISTORY RELIGION AND RELIGIOUS BOOKS LIKE THE VEDAS BIBLE OR THE KORAN HAVE BEEN A MAJOR SOURCE OF LAW.
CIVIL LAW IS THE LEGAL SYSTEM USED IN MOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD TODAY. CIVIL LAW IS BASED ON LEGISLATION THAT IS FOUND IN CONSTITUTIONS OR STATUTES PASSED BY GOVERNMENT. THE SECONDARY PART OF CIVIL LAW IS THE LEGAL APPROACHES THAT ARE PART OF CUSTOM. IN CIVIL LAW GOVERNMENTS JUDGES DO NOT GENERALLY HAVE MUCH POWER AND MOST OF THE LAWS AND LEGAL PRECEDENT ARE CREATED BY MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.
COMMON LAW IS BASED ON THE DECISIONS MADE BY JUDGES IN PAST COURT CASES. IT COMES FROM ENGLAND AND IT BECAME PART OF ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY THAT ONCE BELONGED TO THE BRITISH EMPIRE EXCEPT MALTA SCOTLAND THE U.S. STATE OF LOUISIANA AND THE CANADIAN PROVINCE OF QUEBEC. IT IS ALSO THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF LAW IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE MANY LAWS CALLED STATUTES ARE WRITTEN BY CONGRESS BUT MANY MORE LEGAL RULES EXIST FROM THE DECISIONS OF THE COURTS. COMMON LAW HAD ITS BEGINNINGS IN THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN KING JOHN WAS FORCED BY HIS BARONS TO SIGN A DOCUMENT CALLED THE MAGNA CARTA.
RELIGIOUS LAW IS LAW BASED ON RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR BOOKS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE JEWISH HALAKHA ISLAMIC SHARIA AND CHRISTIAN CANON LAW. 
UNTIL THE 1700S SHARIA LAW WAS THE MAIN LEGAL SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE MUSLIM WORLD. IN SOME MUSLIM COUNTRIES SUCH AS SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAN THE WHOLE LEGAL SYSTEMS STILL BASE THEIR LAW ON SHARIA LAW. ISLAMIC LAW IS OFTEN CRITICISED BECAUSE IT OFTEN HAS HARSH PENALTIES FOR CRIMES. A SERIOUS CRITICISM IS THE JUDGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN COURT THAT SHARIA IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY. 
THE TURKISH REFAH PARTY S SHARIA BASED PLURALITY OF LEGAL SYSTEMS GROUNDED ON RELIGION WAS RULED TO CONTRAVENE THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS. THE COURT DECIDED REFAH S PLAN WOULD DO AWAY WITH THE STATE S ROLE AS THE GUARANTOR OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AND INFRINGE THE PRINCIPLE OF NON DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AS REGARDS THEIR ENJOYMENT OF PUBLIC FREEDOMS WHICH IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY.
THE HISTORY OF LAW IS CLOSELY CONNECTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN CIVILIZATIONS. ANCIENT EGYPTIAN LAW DEVELOPED IN 3000 BC. IN 1760 BC KING HAMMURABI TOOK ANCIENT BABYLONIAN LAW AND ORGANIZED IT AND HAD IT CHISELED IN STONE FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE IN THE MARKETPLACE. THESE LAWS BECAME KNOWN AS THE CODE OF HAMMURABI. 
THE TORAH FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT IS AN OLD BODY OF LAW. IT WAS WRITTEN AROUND 1280 BC. IT HAS MORAL RULES SUCH AS THE TEN COMMANDMENTS WHICH TELL PEOPLE WHAT THINGS ARE NOT PERMITTED. SOMETIMES PEOPLE TRY TO CHANGE THE LAW. FOR EXAMPLE IF PROSTITUTION IS ILLEGAL THEY TRY TO MAKE IT LEGAL.
IN DEMOCRACIES THE PEOPLE IN A COUNTRY USUALLY CHOOSE PEOPLE CALLED POLITICIANS TO REPRESENT THEM IN A LEGISLATURE. EXAMPLES OF LEGISLATURES INCLUDE THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT IN LONDON THE CONGRESS IN WASHINGTON D.C. THE BUNDESTAG IN BERLIN THE DUMA IN MOSCOW AND THE ASSEMBL E NATIONALE IN PARIS. MOST LEGISLATURES HAVE TWO CHAMBERS OR HOUSES A LOWER HOUSE AND AN UPPER HOUSE. TO PASS LEGISLATION A MAJORITY OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT MUST VOTE FOR A BILL IN EACH HOUSE. THE LEGISLATURE IS THE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THAT WRITES LAWS AND VOTES ON WHETHER THEY WILL BE APPROVED.
THE JUDICIARY IS A GROUP OF JUDGES WHO RESOLVE PEOPLE S DISPUTES AND DETERMINE WHETHER PEOPLE WHO ARE CHARGED WITH CRIMES ARE GUILTY. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THE JUDGE DOES NOT FIND GUILT OR INNOCENCE BUT INSTEAD DIRECTS A JURY HOW TO INTERPRET FACTS FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE BUT THE JURY DETERMINES THE FACTS BASED ON EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO THEM AND FINDS THE GUILT OR INNOCENCES OF THE CHARGED PERSON. MOST COUNTRIES OF COMMON LAW AND CIVIL LAW SYSTEMS HAVE A SYSTEM OF APPEALS COURTS UP TO A SUPREME AUTHORITY SUCH AS THE SUPREME COURT OR THE HIGH COURT. THE HIGHEST COURTS USUALLY HAVE THE POWER TO REMOVE LAWS THAT ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL WHICH GO AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION.
THE EXECUTIVE IS THE GOVERNING CENTER OF POLITICAL AUTHORITY. IN MOST DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES THE EXECUTIVE IS ELECTED FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE LEGISLATURE. THIS GROUP OF ELECTED PEOPLE IS CALLED THE CABINET. IN FRANCE THE US AND RUSSIA THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS A PRESIDENT WHICH EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE LEGISLATURE. 
THE EXECUTIVE SUGGESTS NEW LAWS AND DEALS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. AS WELL THE EXECUTIVE USUALLY CONTROLS THE MILITARY THE POLICE AND THE BUREAUCRACY. THE EXECUTIVE SELECTS MINISTERS OR SECRETARIES OF STATE TO CONTROL DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 
IN MANY JURISDICTIONS THE HEAD OF STATE DOES NOT TAKE PART IN THE DAY TO DAY GOVERNANCE OF THE JURISDICTION AND TAKES A LARGELY CEREMONIAL ROLE. THIS IS THE CASE IN MANY COMMONWEALTH NATIONS WHERE THE HEAD OF STATE USUALLY A GOVERNOR ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ACTS ON THE ADVICE OF THE HEAD OF THE EXECUTIVE E.G. THE PRIME MINISTER FIRST MINISTER OR PREMIER. THE PRIMARY LEGAL ROLE OF THE HEAD OF STATE IN THESE JURISDICTIONS IS TO ACT AS A CHECK OR BALANCE AGAINST THE EXECUTIVE AS THE HEAD OF STATE HAS THE RARELY EXERCISED POWER TO DISSOLVE THE LEGISLATURE CALL ELECTIONS AND DISMISS MINISTERS.
THE POLICE ENFORCE THE CRIMINAL LAWS BY ARRESTING PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF BREAKING THE LAW. BUREAUCRATS ARE THE GOVERNMENT WORKERS AND GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT. BUREAUCRATS WORK WITHIN A SYSTEM OF RULES AND THEY MAKE THEIR DECISIONS IN WRITING. 
LAWYERS ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEARNED ABOUT LAWS. LAWYERS GIVE PEOPLE ADVICE ABOUT THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES AND REPRESENT PEOPLE IN COURT. TO BECOME A LAWYER A PERSON HAS TO COMPLETE A TWO OR THREE YEAR UNIVERSITY PROGRAM AT A LAW SCHOOL AND PASS AN ENTRANCE EXAMINATION. LAWYERS WORK IN LAW FIRMS FOR THE GOVERNMENT FOR COMPANIES OR BY THEMSELVES. 
CIVIL SOCIETY IS THE PEOPLE AND GROUPS THAT ARE NOT PART OF GOVERNMENT THAT TRY TO PROTECT PEOPLE AGAINST HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND TRY TO PROTECT FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND OTHER INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PART OF CIVIL SOCIETY INCLUDE POLITICAL PARTIES DEBATING CLUBS TRADE UNIONS HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS NEWSPAPERS AND CHARITIES.
CORPORATIONS ARE AMONG THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT USE THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO FURTHER THEIR GOALS. LIKE THE OTHERS THEY USE MEANS SUCH AS CAMPAIGN DONATIONS AND ADVERTISING TO PERSUADE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE RIGHT. CORPORATIONS ALSO ENGAGE IN COMMERCE AND MAKE NEW THINGS SUCH AS AUTOMOBILES VAPORISERS E CIGARETTES AND UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES I.E. DRONES THAT THE OLD LAWS ARE NOT WELL EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH.
LEONARDO DA VINCI
LEONARDO DA VINCI 15. APRIL 1452 2. MAY 1519 WAS AN ITALIAN MAN WHO LIVED IN THE TIME OF THE RENAISSANCE. HE IS FAMOUS FOR HIS PAINTINGS BUT HE WAS ALSO A SCIENTIST MATHEMATICIAN ENGINEER INVENTOR ANATOMIST SCULPTOR ARCHITECT BOTANIST MUSICIAN AND A WRITER. 
LEONARDO WANTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT NATURE. HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW EVERYTHING WORKED. HE WAS VERY GOOD AT STUDYING DESIGNING AND MAKING ALL SORTS OF INTERESTING THINGS.
MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT LEONARDO WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST PAINTERS OF ALL TIME. OTHER PEOPLE THINK THAT HE WAS THE MOST TALENTED PERSON EVER TO HAVE LIVED. THE ART HISTORIAN HELEN GARDNER SAID THAT NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN QUITE LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE WAS INTERESTED IN SO MANY THINGS THAT HE SEEMS TO HAVE HAD THE MIND OF A GIANT AND YET WHAT HE WAS LIKE AS A PERSON IS STILL A MYSTERY.
LEONARDO WAS BORN AT VINCI WHICH IS A SMALL TOWN NEAR FLORENCE ITALY. HE WAS TRAINED TO BE AN ARTIST BY THE SCULPTOR AND PAINTER VERROCCHIO. HE SPENT MOST OF HIS LIFE WORKING FOR RICH ITALIAN NOBLEMEN. IN HIS LAST YEARS HE LIVED IN A BEAUTIFUL HOME GIVEN TO HIM BY THE KING OF FRANCE.
TWO OF HIS PICTURES ARE AMONG THE BEST KNOWN PAINTINGS IN THE WORLD THE MONA LISA AND THE LAST SUPPER. HE DID MANY DRAWINGS. THE BEST KNOWN DRAWING IS VITRUVIAN MAN. LEONARDO WAS OFTEN THINKING OF NEW INVENTIONS. HE KEPT NOTEBOOKS WITH NOTES AND DRAWINGS OF THESE IDEAS. MOST OF HIS INVENTIONS WERE NEVER MADE. SOME OF HIS IDEAS WERE A HELICOPTER A TANK A CALCULATOR A PARACHUTE A ROBOT A TELEPHONE EVOLUTION AND SOLAR POWER.
LEONARDO WAS BORN ON 15 APRIL 1452 IN THE TUSCAN HILL TOWN OF VINCI IN THE VALLEY OF THE ARNO RIVER. HIS GRANDFATHER ANTONIO DA VINCI WROTE DOWN THE DETAILS OF THE BIRTH. LEONARDO S PARENTS WERE NOT MARRIED. HIS FATHER WAS A NOTARY SER PIERO DA VINCI. HIS MOTHER CATERINA WAS A SERVANT. SHE MAY HAVE BEEN A SLAVE FROM THE MIDDLE EAST. OR FROM CHINA. HIS FATHER LATER ON TOOK CUSTODY OF LEONARDO AND HIS MOTHER RE MARRIED AND HAD 5 MORE CHILDREN. LEONARDO S FULL NAME WAS LEONARDO DI SER PIERO DA VINCI WHICH MEANS LEONARDO THE SON OF MESSER MISTER PIERDAOM VINCI.
LEONARDO SPENT HIS FIRST FIVE YEARS LIVING IN A FARM HOUSE WITH HIS MOTHER. THEN HE LIVED AT VINCI WITH HIS FATHER HIS FATHER S NEW WIFE ALBIERA HIS GRANDPARENTS AND UNCLE FRANCESCO. WHEN LEONARDO GREW UP HE ONLY WROTE DOWN TWO MEMORIES FROM HIS CHILDHOOD. HE REMEMBERED THAT WHEN HE WAS LYING OUTSIDE IN HIS CRADLE A LARGE BIRD FLEW FROM THE SKY AND HOVERED OVER HIM. ITS TAIL FEATHERS BRUSHED HIS FACE. LEONARDO S OTHER IMPORTANT MEMORY WAS HOW HE FOUND A CAVE WHILE EXPLORING IN THE MOUNTAINS. HE WAS TERRIFIED THAT SOME GREAT MONSTER MIGHT BE HIDING THERE. BUT HE WAS ALSO VERY EXCITED AND WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS INSIDE.
LEONARDO STARTED PAINTING WHILE HE WAS STILL A BOY. GIORGIO VASARI WROTE ABOUT LEONARDO S LIFE SHORTLY AFTER HIS DEATH. HE TELLS MANY INTERESTING STORIES ABOUT HOW CLEVER LEONARDO WAS. HE SAYS THAT LEONARDO PAINTED A ROUND WOODEN SHIELD WITH A PICTURE OF SNAKES SPITTING FIRE. MESSER PIERO TOOK HIS SON S PAINTING TO FLORENCE AND SOLD IT TO AN ART DEALER.
IN 1466 WHEN LEONARDO WAS FOURTEEN HIS FATHER TOOK HIM TO FLORENCE TO BE AN APPRENTICE TO THE ARTIST VERROCCHIO.
FLORENCE WAS A VERY EXCITING PLACE FOR A YOUNG PERSON WHO WANTED TO BE AN ARTIST. MANY FAMOUS ARTISTS HAD LIVED IN FLORENCE STARTING WITH CIMABUE AND GIOTTO IN THE 1200S. EVERYWHERE A PERSON LOOKED THERE WERE FAMOUS AND BEAUTIFUL ARTWORKS. THE HUGE CATHEDRAL HAD AN ENORMOUS NEW DOME. THE CHURCH OF ST JOHN HAD DOORS THAT GLEAMED WITH GOLD AND WERE SAID TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DOORS IN THE WORLD. ANOTHER CHURCH HAD STATUES ALL AROUND IT BY THE MOST FAMOUS SCULPTORS INCLUDING ONE BY LEONARDO S TEACHER VERROCCHIO.
IF AN ARTIST WAS LUCKY THEY WOULD FIND A RICH PATRON WHO WOULD BUY LOTS OF THEIR PAINTINGS. THE RICHEST FAMILY IN FLORENCE WERE THE MEDICI. THEY HAD BUILT THEMSELVES THE FINEST PALACE IN FLORENCE AND LIKED BUYING PAINTINGS STATUES AND OTHER BEAUTIFUL THINGS. THEY WERE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE STUDY OF LITERATURE AND PHILOSOPHY. MANY YOUNG ARTISTS HOPED TO GET WORK FROM THE MEDICI AND THEIR FRIENDS.
VERROCCHIO HAD A BIG WORKSHOP THAT WAS ONE OF THE BUSIEST IN FLORENCE. LEONARDO WAS LEARNING TO BE AN ARTIST SO HE HAD TO LEARN DRAWING PAINTING SCULPTING AND MODEL MAKING. WHILE HE WAS AT THE WORKSHOP HE WAS ABLE TO LEARN ALL SORTS OF OTHER USEFUL SKILLS CHEMISTRY METALLURGY METAL WORKING PLASTER CASTING LEATHER WORKING MECHANICS AND CARPENTRY.
LEONARDO WAS NOT THE ONLY YOUNG PAINTER AT VERROCCHIO S WORKSHOP. MANY OTHER PAINTERS WERE TRAINED THERE OR OFTEN VISITED. SOME OF THEM LATER BECAME FAMOUS GHIRLANDAIO PERUGINO AND BOTTICELLI. THESE ARTISTS WERE ALL JUST A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN LEONARDO.
GIORGIO VASARI TELLS AN INTERESTING STORY FROM THIS TIME OF LEONARDO S LIFE. VERROCCHIO WAS PAINTING A LARGE PICTURE OF THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST. HE GAVE LEONARDO THE JOB OF PAINTING ONE OF THE ANGELS HOLDING JESUS ROBE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PICTURE. VASARI SAID THAT LEONARDO PAINTED THE ANGEL SO BEAUTIFULLY THAT VERROCCHIO PUT DOWN HIS BRUSH AND NEVER PAINTED AGAIN. WHEN THE PAINTING IS EXAMINED CLOSELY IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE PICTURE SUCH AS THE ROCKS THE BROWN STREAM AND THE BACKGROUND MAY HAVE BEEN PAINTED BY LEONARDO AS WELL. VERROCCHIO MADE A BRONZE STATUE OF DAVID AT THIS TIME. IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE USED LEONARDO AS HIS MODEL.
IN ABOUT 1472 WHEN HE WAS TWENTY LEONARDO JOINED THE GUILD OF ST LUKE AN ORGANISATION OF ARTISTS AND DOCTORS OF MEDICINE. EVEN AFTER HIS FATHER SET HIM UP IN HIS OWN WORKSHOP LEONARDO STILL ENJOYED WORKING AT VERROCCHIO S WORKSHOP. LEONARDO S EARLIEST KNOWN WORK IS A DRAWING IN PEN AND INK OF THE ARNO RIVER VALLEY. IT HAS THE DATE 5 AUGUST 1473. IT IS NOW IN THE UFFIZI GALLERY. 
WHEN VASARI WRITES ABOUT LEONARDO HE USES WORDS LIKE NOBLE GENEROUS GRACEFUL AND BEAUTIFUL. VASARI TELLS US THAT AS AN ADULT LEONARDO WAS A TALL HANDSOME MAN. HE WAS SO STRONG THAT HE COULD BEND HORSESHOES WITH HIS BARE HANDS. HIS VOICE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT IT CHARMED EVERYONE THAT HEARD IT. ALMOST EVERYONE WANTED TO BE HIS FRIEND. HE LOVED ANIMALS WAS A VEGETARIAN AND WOULD BUY BIRDS AT THE MARKET AND SET THEM FREE.
VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT LEONARDO S LIFE AND WORK BETWEEN 1472 AND 1481. HE WAS PROBABLY BUSY IN FLORENCE. IN 1478 HE HAD AN IMPORTANT COMMISSION TO PAINT AN ALTARPIECE FOR THE MONKS OF SAN DONATO A SCOPETO. THE PAINTING WAS TO BE THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI THE THREE WISE MEN. THE PAINTING WAS NEVER FINISHED BECAUSE LEONARDO WAS SENT AWAY TO MILAN.
LEONARDO WAS A VERY TALENTED MUSICIAN. IN 1482 HE MADE A SILVER LYRE A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT IN THE SHAPE OF A HORSE S HEAD. AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A NEW RULER IN THE CITY OF MILAN IN THE NORTH OF ITALY. DUKE LUDOVICO IL MORO WAS MAKING OTHER RULERS NERVOUS. LORENZO MEDICI SENT LEONARDO TO MILAN AS AN AMBASSADOR. LORENZO DE MEDICI WANTED LEONARDO TO GIVE LUDOVICO THE LYRE AS A PRESENT FROM HIM. LEONARDO WROTE A LETTER TO THE DUKE OF MILAN TELLING HIM ABOUT ALL THE CLEVER AND USEFUL THINGS THAT HE COULD DO LIKE MAKING WAR MACHINES. HE WROTE IN THE LETTER THAT HE COULD ALSO PAINT. LEONARDO DID NOT KNOW AT THE TIME THAT IT WAS FOR PAINTING THAT HE WOULD BE MOSTLY REMEMBERED. LEONARDO STAYED IN MILAN AND WORKED FOR THE DUKE BETWEEN 1482 AND 1499. PART OF HIS WORK WAS TO DESIGN FESTIVALS AND CARNIVAL PROCESSIONS. IN LEONARDO S NOTE BOOKS ARE DRAWINGS OF THEATRE COSTUMES AMAZING HELMETS AND SCENES THAT MIGHT BE FOR THE THEATRE. 
LEONARDO LIKE MOST OTHER WELL KNOWN ARTISTS OF HIS TIME HAD SERVANTS YOUNG STUDENTS AND OLDER ASSISTANTS IN HIS WORKSHOP. ONE OF HIS YOUNG STUDENTS WAS A BOY WHOSE NAME WAS GIAN GIACOMO CAPROTTI DA ORENO. HE WAS A HANDSOME BOY WITH BEAUTIFUL LONG GOLDEN CURLS. HE LOOKED PERFECT AS AN ARTIST S MODEL FOR AN ANGEL. BUT HE WAS SUCH A DIFFICULT AND DISHONEST BOY THAT LEONARDO CALLED HIM SALAI OR SALAINO WHICH MEANS THE LITTLE DEVIL. LEONARDO WROTE IN HIS NOTEBOOK THAT SALAI WAS VERY GREEDY THAT HE WAS A LIAR AND THAT HE HAD STOLEN THINGS FROM THE HOUSE AT LEAST FIVE TIMES. SALAI STAYED IN LEONARDO S HOUSEHOLD FOR THIRTY YEARS AS A PUPIL AND A SERVANT.
LEONARDO S MOST IMPORTANT WORK FOR DUKE LUDOVICO WAS TO MAKE A HUGE STATUE OF THE PREVIOUS RULER FRANCESCO SFORZA ON HORSEBACK. HE STARTED WITH THE HORSE. AFTER STUDYING HORSES AND DRAWING DESIGNS HE MADE A HUGE HORSE OF CLAY. IT WAS CALLED THE GRAN CAVALLO. IT WAS GOING TO BE CAST IN BRONZE. IT WAS GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST BRONZE HORSE THAT HAD BEEN MADE FOR MORE THAN A THOUSAND YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY THE BRONZE HORSE WAS NEVER MADE. IN 1494 LUDOVICO GAVE THE BRONZE TO BE MADE INTO CANNONS BECAUSE THE FRENCH ARMY WAS INVADING MILAN. THE HUGE CLAY HORSE WAS STILL STANDING WHEN THE FRENCH ARMY INVADED AGAIN IN 1499. THIS TIME IT WAS USED FOR TARGET PRACTICE AND WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED.
WHILE LEONARDO WAS WORKING FOR DUKE LUDOVICO HE HAD TWO IMPORTANT PAINTING COMMISSIONS. ONE WAS TO DO AN OIL PAINTING TO GO IN A BIG ALTARPIECE FOR THE CONFRATERNITY OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. LEONARDO DID THE PAINTING TWICE. HE LEFT ONE WITH THE MONKS IN MILAN AND TOOK THE OTHER PAINTING TO FRANCE WHERE IT IS NOW IN THE LOUVRE MUSEUM. THE PAINTINGS ARE BOTH CALLED THE VIRGIN OF THE ROCKS. THEY SHOW A SCENE OF THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE CHILD JESUS IN A ROCKY MYSTERIOUS LANDSCAPE. MARY AND JESUS ARE MEETING WITH JOHN THE BAPTIST. THERE IS A STORY WHICH IS NOT IN THE BIBLE BUT IS PART OF CHRISTIAN TRADITION ABOUT HOW THE BABY JOHN AND THE BABY JESUS MET ON THE ROAD TO EGYPT. IN THIS SCENE JOHN IS PRAYING AND THE BABY JESUS RAISES HIS HAND TO BLESS JOHN. THE PAINTINGS HAVE A STRANGE EERIE LIGHT WITH SOFT DEEP SHADOWS. IN THE BACKGROUND IS A LAKE AND MOUNTAINS IN THE MIST. NO PAINTING LIKE THIS HAD EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.
LEONARDO S OTHER IMPORTANT PAINTING IN MILAN IS EVEN MORE FAMOUS. IT IS THE LAST SUPPER. THE PAINTING SHOWS THE LAST MEAL SHARED BY JESUS WITH HIS DISCIPLES BEFORE HIS CAPTURE AND DEATH. LEONARDO CHOSE TO PAINT THE MOMENT WHEN JESUS HAS SAID ONE OF YOU WILL BETRAY ME. LEONARDO TELLS THE STORY OF THE SURPRISE AND UPSET THAT THIS CAUSED TO THE TWELVE FOLLOWERS OF JESUS. HE TELLS THE STORY THROUGH THE ACTIONS AND FACES OF THE PEOPLE IN THE PAINTING. SOME OF THEM ARE TALKING SOME OF THEM HAVE STOOD UP SOME ARE RAISING THEIR HANDS IN HORROR.
THE NOVELIST MATTEO BANDELLO SAW LEONARDO AT WORK. BANDELLO WROTE THAT ON SOME DAYS HE WOULD PAINT FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT WITHOUT STOPPING TO EAT. THEN FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS HE WOULD NOT PAINT AT ALL. HE WOULD OFTEN JUST STAND AND LOOK AT THE PAINTING. VASARI SAID THAT THE PRIOR OF THE CONVENT WAS VERY ANNOYED. HE ASKED LUDOVICO TO TELL LEONARDO TO WORK FASTER. VASARI SAID THAT LEONARDO WAS WORRIED BECAUSE HE DID NOT THINK THAT HE COULD PAINT THE FACE OF JESUS WELL ENOUGH. LEONARDO TOLD THE DUKE THAT HE MIGHT USE THE FACE OF THE PRIOR AS HIS MODEL FOR JUDAS THE TRAITOR.
WHEN IT WAS FINISHED EVERYONE THAT SAW IT SAID THAT THE PAINTING WAS A MASTERPIECE. BUT LEONARDO HAD NOT USED PROPER FRESCO FOR THE PAINTING. HE HAD USED TEMPERA OVER GESSO WHICH IS NOT USUALLY USED FOR WALL PAINTING. SOON THE PAINTING STARTED TO GROW MOLD AND FLAKE OFF THE WALL. IN A HUNDRED YEARS IT WAS COMPLETELY RUINED.
EVEN THOUGH IN SOME PLACES THE PAINT HAS FALLEN RIGHT OFF THE WALL THE PAINTING IS SO POPULAR THAT IT IS PRINTED AND COPIED MORE THAT ANY OTHER RELIGIOUS PAINTING IN THE WORLD.
IN 1499 LUDOVICO IL MORO WAS OVERTHROWN. LEONARDO LEFT MILAN WITH HIS SERVANT SALAI AND A FRIEND LUCA PACIOLI WHO WAS A MATHEMATICIAN. THEY WENT TO VENICE. LEONARDO WORKED AS A MILITARY ARCHITECT AND ENGINEER. BECAUSE VENICE IS A CITY ON MANY ISLANDS LEONARDO TRIED TO THINK OF WAYS TO DEFEND THE CITY FROM A NAVAL ATTACK.
IN 1500 LEONARDO WENT BACK TO FLORENCE TAKING HIS HOUSEHOLD OF SERVANTS AND APPRENTICES WITH HIM. THE MONKS FROM THE MONASTERY OF THE HOLY ANNUNCIATION GAVE LEONARDO A HOME AND A LARGE WORKSHOP. IN 2005 SOME BUILDINGS WHICH WERE USED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MILITARY GEOGRAPHY WERE BEING RESTORED. THE RESTORERS DISCOVERED THAT PART OF THE BUILDING WAS LEONARDO S STUDIO.
LEONARDO STARTED WORK ON A NEW PAINTING. HE DREW A LARGE CARTOON. THIS MEANS A DRAWING THAT IS A PLAN FOR THE PAINTING. THE CARTOON SHOWED THE VIRGIN MARY SITTING ON THE KNEE OF HER MOTHER ST ANNE. MARY HOLDS THE BABY JESUS IN HER ARMS. JESUS STRETCHES OUT HIS HANDS TO HIS YOUNG COUSIN JOHN THE BAPTIST. VASARI SAYS THAT EVERYONE WAS SO AMAZED BY THE BEAUTIFUL DRAWING THAT MEN AND WOMEN YOUNG AND OLD CAME IN LARGE GROUPS TO SEE IT AS IF THEY WERE ATTENDING A GREAT FESTIVAL. THE DRAWING IS NOW IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY LONDON. EVEN THOUGH IT IS OLD AND FADED AND IS KEPT IN A DARK ROOM PEOPLE GO TO THE GALLERY TO SIT IN FRONT OF IT EVERY DAY. LIKE MANY OF LEONARDO S PROJECTS THE PAINTING WAS NEVER DONE.
IN 1502 AND 1503 LEONARDO WORKED FOR CESARE BORGIA A POWERFUL NOBLE WHO WAS THE SON OF POPE ALEXANDER VI. LEONARDO TRAVELLED AROUND ITALY WITH BORGIA AS A MILITARY ARCHITECT AND ENGINEER. LATE IN 1503 LEONARDO RETURNED TO FLORENCE. HE REJOINED THE GUILD OF ST LUKE. 
HE WAS GIVEN A VERY IMPORTANT COMMISSION. THE SIGNORIA TOWN COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FLORENCE WANTED TWO LARGE FRESCOS PAINTED ON THE WALLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ROOM OF THE SIGNORIA PALACE. MICHELANGELO WAS TO PAINT THE BATTLE OF CASCINA AND LEONARDO WAS TO PAINT THE BATTLE OF ANGHIARI. LEONARDO BEGAN THE PROJECT BY STUDYING AND DRAWING THE FACES OF ANGRY MEN AND FIGHTING HORSES. THESE DRAWINGS CAN STILL BE SEEN IN HIS NOTEBOOKS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS WAS TO BE ANOTHER FAILURE FOR LEONARDO. WHEN HE PAINTED THE PICTURE ON THE WALL INSTEAD OF USING FRESCO HE MIXED THE PAINTS WITH OIL. THE PAINT WOULD NOT DRY. LEONARDO LIT SOME FIRES TO DRY IT AND THE PAINTING MELTED. PETER PAUL RUBENS DREW A COPY OF THE MIDDLE PART. AFTER A TIME THE TOWN COUNCIL COVERED IT UP AND GOT SOMEBODY ELSE TO PAINT THE WALL. MICHELANGELO DID NOT FINISH HIS PAINTING EITHER BECAUSE THE POPE CALLED HIM TO ROME.
IN ABOUT 1503 LEONARDO BEGAN PAINTING THE A PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN KNOWN AS MONA LISA THE MOST FAMOUS PORTRAIT THAT HAS EVER BEEN PAINTED. HE CONTINUED WORKING ON IT FOR MANY YEARS. IT IS A SMALL PICTURE PAINTED IN OIL ON A WOODEN PANEL. IT SHOWS THE FACE UPPER BODY AND HANDS OF A WOMAN. SHE IS VERY PLAINLY DRESSED. FOR A PORTRAIT A WOMAN WOULD USUALLY PUT ON HER BEST CLOTHES AND JEWELLERY. MONA LISA HAS A DARK DRESS AND A FINE BLACK VEIL OVER HER HEAD. LEONARDO OFTEN LEFT SYMBOLS IN HIS PAINTINGS THAT GIVE CLUES ABOUT THE PERSON. THE UNUSUAL THING ABOUT THIS PICTURE IS THE SMILE. THE SMILE IS THE CLUE TO HER NAME MONA LISA GIACONDO. GIACONDO MEANS THE JOKING ONE. MONA IS SHORT FOR MADONNA WHICH MEANS MY LADY. 
THE REASON WHY THE PAINTING IS SO FAMOUS IS THAT IT SEEMS TO BE FULL OF MYSTERY. MONA LISA S EYES LOOK OUT AT THE VIEWER. BUT NO ONE CAN GUESS WHAT SHE IS THINKING. HER EYES AND HER MOUTH SEEM TO BE SMILING. THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL IN A PORTRAIT PAINTING. MOST PEOPLE IN PORTRAITS LOOK VERY SERIOUS. IT IS HARD TO TELL WHAT MONA LISA S EXACT EXPRESSION IS. WHEN A PERSON WANTS TO READ ANOTHER PERSON S FEELINGS THEY LOOK AT THE CORNERS OF THEIR MOUTH AND EYES. BUT LEONARDO HAS PAINTED SOFT SHADOWS IN THE CORNERS OF MONA LISA S MOUTH AND EYES TO DISGUISE HER EXPRESSION. THE SOFT SHADOWS ARE ALSO FOUND ON THE SIDES OF HER FACE HER NECK AND HANDS. THE WAY THAT LEONARDO USES SHADOW IS CALLED SFUMATO WHICH IS AN ITALIAN WORD FOR SMOKE. VASARI SAID THAT THE PICTURE WAS SO BEAUTIFULLY PAINTED THAT EVERY OTHER ARTIST WHO LOOKED AT IT THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD NEVER PAINT SO WELL.
IN 1506 LEONARDO WENT BACK TO MILAN WITH HIS PUPILS AND LIVED IN HIS OWN HOUSE IN PORTA ORIENTALE. SOME OF THE PUPILS BECAME PAINTERS BERNARDINO LUINI GIOVANNI ANTONIO BOLTRAFFIO AND MARCO D OGGIONE. D OGGIONE MADE SEVERAL COPIES OF THE LAST SUPPER. LUINI MADE A COPY OF THE VIRGIN OF THE ROCKS. BOLTRAFFIO AND THE OTHERS PAINTED MANY MADONNA AND CHILD PICTURES WHICH CAN STILL BE SEEN IN ART GALLERIES AND CHURCHES. ONE OF PUPILS WAS A YOUNG NOBLEMAN CALLED COUNT FRANCESCO MELZI. MELZI NEVER BECAME A VERY GOOD PAINTER BUT HE LOVED LEONARDO AND STAYED WITH HIM UNTIL THE DAY HE DIED.
IN SEPTEMBER 1513 LEONARDO WENT TO ROME AND LIVED THERE UNTIL 1516. HE LIVED IN THE VATICAN. THE THREE GREATEST PAINTERS OF THE HIGH RENAISSANCE LEONARDO MICHELANGELO AND RAPHAEL WERE ALL WORKING IN ROME AT THE SAME TIME. EVEN THOUGH THEIR NAMES ARE OFTEN SAID TOGETHER AS IF THEY WERE FRIENDS THEY WERE NOT. LEONARDO AT THIS TIME WAS IN HIS SIXTIES MICHELANGELO WAS MIDDLE AGED. HE WAS NOT FRIENDLY TO EITHER LEONARDO OR RAPHAEL. RAPHAEL WAS A VERY CLEVER YOUNG PAINTER WHO LEARNT A LOT BY LOOKING AT THE PICTURES PAINTED BY LEONARDO AND MICHELANGELO. BUT NEITHER OF THEM WAS EVER HIS TEACHER.
IN OCTOBER 1515 KING FRANCIS I OF FRANCE CAPTURED MILAN. ON DECEMBER 19 THERE WAS A MEETING OF FRANCIS I AND POPE LEO X IN BOLOGNA. LEONARDO WENT TO THE MEETING WITH POPE LEO. 
LEONARDO MADE AN AMAZING TOY TO ENTERTAIN KING FRANCIS. IT WAS A LIFE SIZED MECHANICAL LION THAT COULD WALK. IT HAD DOORS IN ITS CHEST WHICH OPENED AND A BUNCH OF LILIES CAME OUT. LILIES WERE THE ROYAL SYMBOL OF THE FRENCH KINGS.
IN 1516 FRANCIS I INVITED LEONARDO TO GO TO FRANCE WITH HIM. HE GAVE LEONARDO A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE CALLED CLOS LUC SOMETIMES CALLED CLOUX. IT IS NEAR THE KING S PALACE CHATEAU AMBOISE. LEONARDO SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS OF HIS LIFE AT CLOS LUC WITH HIS FAITHFUL FRIEND AND APPRENTICE COUNT MELZI. THE KING GAVE LEONARDO A PENSION OF 10 000 SCUDI. ONE OF THE LAST PAINTINGS THAT LEONARDO DID WAS A PICTURE OF JOHN THE BAPTIST. HIS MODEL WAS SALAI WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL LONG CURLING HAIR.
WHEN LEONARDO WAS DYING HE ASKED FOR A PRIEST TO COME SO THAT HE COULD MAKE HIS CONFESSION AND RECEIVE HOLY COMMUNION.
LEONARDO DIED AT CLOS LUC ON MAY 2 1519. KING FRANCIS HAD BECOME A CLOSE FRIEND. VASARI SAYS THAT THE KING HELD LEONARDO S HEAD IN HIS ARMS AS HE DIED. IN HIS WILL HE ASKED THAT SIXTY BEGGARS SHOULD FOLLOW HIS CASKET IN PROCESSION. HE WAS BURIED IN THE CHAPEL OF THE CHATEAU AMBOISE.
LEONARDO HAD NEVER MARRIED AND HAD NO CHILDREN OF HIS OWN. IN HIS WILL HE LEFT HIS MONEY HIS BOOKS AND MOST OF HIS PAINTINGS TO COUNT MELZI. LEONARDO ALSO REMEMBERED HIS OTHER PUPIL SALAI AND HIS SERVANT BATTISTA DI VILUSSIS WHO EACH RECEIVED HALF OF LEONARDO S VINEYARDS NEAR MILAN. LEONARDO S LEFT TO HIS SERVING WOMAN A BLACK CLOAK WITH A FUR EDGE. SALAI WAS THE OWNER OF LEONARDO S MOST FAMOUS OIL PAINTING THE MONA LISA. HE STILL OWNED IT A FEW YEARS LATER WHEN HE DIED AFTER FIGHTING IN A DUEL.
KING FRANCIS SAID THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANOTHER MAN BORN IN THE WORLD WHO KNEW AS MUCH AS LEONARDO NOT SO MUCH ABOUT PAINTING SCULPTURE AND ARCHITECTURE AS THAT HE WAS A VERY GREAT PHILOSOPHER. 
LEONARDO DID NOT PAINT VERY MANY PICTURES. BUT HE DREW HUNDREDS OF QUICK SKETCHES PLANS MAPS AND DETAILED DRAWINGS. THIS IS THE WAY THAT HE RECORDED ALL THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT HE SAW STUDIED AND THOUGHT ABOUT.
SOME OF LEONARDO S DRAWINGS ARE STUDIES FOR PAINTINGS. IN THESE DRAWINGS LEONARDO PLANNED THE THINGS HE WAS GOING TO PAINT. SOME STUDIES ARE PLANS FOR WHOLE PAINTINGS. ONE OF THESE PAINTINGS IS THE LARGE BEAUTIFUL DRAWING OF THE MADONNA AND CHILD WITH ST ANNE AND ST JOHN THE BAPTIST THAT IS NOW IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY LONDON.
MANY OF THE STUDIES SHOW DETAILS THAT LEONARDO WANTED TO GET JUST RIGHT. ONE STUDY SHOWS A VERY DETAILED PERSPECTIVE DRAWING OF THE RUINED BUILDINGS IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE PAINTING OF THE MAGI. OTHER STUDIES SHOW HANDS FACES DRAPERY PLANTS HORSES AND BABIES.
THE EARLIEST DRAWING BY LEONARDO THAT HAS A DATE ON IT IS A LANDSCAPE OF THE ARNO VALLEY 1473 WHICH SHOWS THE RIVER THE MOUNTAINS MONTELUPO CASTLE AND THE FARMLANDS BEYOND IT IN GREAT DETAIL.
LEONARDO STUDIED THINGS ALL HIS LIFE. HE DID NOT GO TO UNIVERSITY TO STUDY. HE STUDIED BY LOOKING AT THINGS IN THE WORLD AROUND HIM. HE LOOKED AT THINGS TO SEE HOW THEY WERE MADE AND HOW THEY WORKED. HE DREW THE THINGS THAT HE SAW AND THE DISCOVERIES THAT HE MADE INTO HIS NOTEBOOKS AND MADE NOTES ABOUT THEM. MANY OF HIS NOTEBOOKS ARE NOW IN MUSEUMS. THERE ARE 13 000 PAGES OF NOTES AND DRAWINGS. MANY OF THESE ARE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES.
LEONARDO S NOTEBOOKS ARE HARD TO READ BECAUSE HE WROTE BACKWARDS IN MIRROR WRITING. SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT PERHAPS HE WAS TRYING TO KEEP HIS WORK SECRET. THIS IS NOT TRUE. LEONARDO WROTE AND SOMETIMES DREW WITH HIS LEFT HAND. IN THOSE DAYS PENS WERE MADE FROM A QUILL A LARGE FEATHER THAT WAS CUT WITH A PEN KNIFE ON THE END. IT IS HARD FOR A LEFT HANDED PERSON TO WRITE WITH A QUILL IN THE ORDINARY WAY BUT QUITE EASY TO WRITE BACKWARDS.
IT IS LIKELY THAT LEONARDO PLANNED TO PUBLISH THE STUDIES IN HIS NOTEBOOKS. HE ORGANIZED MANY PAGES CAREFULLY WITH ONE STUDY TAKING UP THE FRONT AND BACK OF EACH PAGE. THERE IS A PAGE WITH DRAWINGS AND WRITING ABOUT THE HUMAN HEART AND A PAGE ABOUT THE WOMB AND THE FETUS. ONE PAGE SHOWS DRAWINGS OF THE MUSCLES OF A SHOULDER AND ANOTHER PAGE SHOWS HOW AN ARM WORKS.
THE NOTEBOOKS WERE NOT PUBLISHED IN LEONARDO S LIFETIME. AFTER HE DIED THEY WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO HAD KNOWN HIM. THEY ARE NEARLY ALL IN MUSEUMS OR LIBRARIES SUCH AS WINDSOR CASTLE THE LOUVRE AND THE BRITISH LIBRARY. THE BIBLIOTECA AMBROSIANA A LIBRARY IN MILAN HAS THE TWELVE VOLUME CODEX ATLANTICUS.

MANY OF THE DRAWINGS AND NOTES IN LEONARDO S NOTEBOOKS ARE DESIGNS PLANS AND INVENTIONS.

LIFE
LIFE IS A BIOLOGICAL CONCEPT REGARDING THE CHARACTERISTICS STATE OR MODE THAT SEPARATES A LIVING THING FROM DEAD MATTER.
THE WORD ITSELF MAY REFER TO A LIVING BEING OR ONGOING PROCESSES OF WHICH LIVING THINGS ARE A PART OF. IT MAY ALSO REFER TO THE PERIOD DURING WHICH SOMETHING IS FUNCTIONAL AS BETWEEN BIRTH AND DEATH THE CONDITION OF AN ENTITY THAT HAS BEEN BORN BUT YET HAS TO DIE OR THAT WHICH MAKES A LIVING THING ALIVE.
THE STUDY OF LIFE IS CALLED BIOLOGY AND PEOPLE WHO STUDY LIFE ARE CALLED BIOLOGISTS. A LIFESPAN IS THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF LIFE IN A SPECIES. ALL KNOWN LIFE ON EARTH IS POWERED BY SOLAR ENERGY. WITHOUT ENERGY FROM THE SUN NO LIFE COULD EXIST. ALL LIFE ON EARTH IS BASED ON THE CHEMISTRY OF CARBON COMPOUNDS SPECIFICALLY INVOLVING LONG CHAIN MOLECULES SUCH AS PROTEINS AND NUCLEIC ACID. WITH WATER WHICH IS ESSENTIAL THE LONG MOLECULES ARE WRAPPED INSIDE MEMBRANES TO FORM CELLS. THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE OF ALL POSSIBLE FORMS OF LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE IT IS TRUE OF ALL LIFE ON EARTH TODAY.
LIVING ORGANISMS ARE OPEN SYSTEMS. THEY ARE ALWAYS CHANGING BECAUSE THEY EXCHANGE MATERIALS AND INFORMATION WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THEY UNDERGO METABOLISM MAINTAIN HOMEOSTASIS POSSESS A CAPACITY TO GROW RESPOND TO STIMULI AND REPRODUCE.
THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION THEY ADAPT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT IN SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS. MORE COMPLEX LIVING ORGANISMS CAN COMMUNICATE THROUGH VARIOUS MEANS. MANY LIFE FORMS CAN BE FOUND ON EARTH. THE PROPERTIES COMMON TO THESE ORGANISMS PLANTS ANIMALS FUNGI PROTISTS ARCHAEA AND BACTERIA ARE A CARBON AND WATER BASED CELLULAR FORM WITH COMPLEX ORGANIZATION AND HERITABLE GENETIC INFORMATION.
AT PRESENT THE EARTH IS THE ONLY PLANET WE HAVE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER LIFE EXISTS ELSEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE IS OPEN. THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF CLAIMS OF LIFE ELSEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE. NONE OF THESE HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED SO FAR. THE BEST EVIDENCE OF LIFE OUTSIDE OF EARTH IS ARE NUCLEIC ACIDS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND IN CERTAIN TYPES OF METEORITES.
ONE EXPLANATION OF LIFE IS CALLED THE CELL THEORY. THE CELL THEORY HAS THREE BASIC POINTS ALL LIVING THINGS ARE MADE UP OF CELLS. THE CELL IS THE SMALLEST LIVING THING THAT CAN DO ALL THE THINGS NEEDED FOR LIFE. ALL CELLS MUST COME FROM PRE EXISTING CELLS.
SOMETHING IS OFTEN SAID TO BE ALIVE IF IT 
HOWEVER NOT ALL LIVING THINGS FIT EVERY POINT ON THIS LIST.
THEY DO HOWEVER FIT THE BIOCHEMICAL DEFINITIONS THEY ARE MADE OF THE SAME KIND OF CHEMICALS.
THE THERMODYNAMIC DEFINITION OF LIFE IS ANY SYSTEM WHICH CAN KEEP ITS ENTROPY LEVELS BELOW MAXIMUM USUALLY THROUGH ADAPTATION AND MUTATIONS.
A MODERN DEFINITION WAS GIVEN BY HUMBERTO MATURANA AND FRANCISCO VARELA IN 1980 TO WHICH THEY GAVE THE NAME AUTOPOIESIS 
ROTH COMMENTED THAT IN SHORT ORGANISMS ARE SELF REPRODUCING AND SELF MAINTAINING OR AUTOPOIETIC SYSTEMS. THIS APPROACH MAKES USE OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY IDEAS AND SYSTEMS SCIENCE IDEAS.
LOS ANGELES
LOS ANGELES OFFICIALLY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ALSO CALLED L.A. IS A CITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES. THERE ARE 3 847 400 PEOPLE LIVING IN THE CITY AND OVER 18 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE L.A. REGION. THE CITY HAS AN AREA OF 1200 SQUARE KILOMETERS. L.A. HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION OF ANY CITY IN THE UNITED STATES THE FIRST BEING NEW YORK CITY. IT IS ALSO THE LARGEST CITY OF CALIFORNIA.
THE NAME LOS ANGELES COMES FROM THE SPANISH LANGUAGE AND IT MEANS THE ANGELS. THE NAME IS AN ABBREVIATION FROM THE ORIGINAL NAME OF THE PLACE. THE ORIGINAL NAME IS EL PUEBLO DE NUESTRA SE ORA LA REINA DE LOS NGELES DEL R O PORCI NCULA IN ENGLISH TOWN OF OUR LADY THE QUEEN OF ANGELS OF THE RIVER PORCI NCULA. LOS ANGELES WAS FOUNDED IN 1781. THE AREA HAD EARLIER BEEN EXPLORED BY TWO FRANCISCAN PRIESTS NAMED JUNIPERO SERRA AND JUAN CRESPI WHEN CALIFORNIA STILL BELONGED TO SPAIN. ON APRIL 4 1850 CALIFORNIA BECAME A STATE OF THE USA. LOS ANGELES BEGAN TO GROW RAPIDLY FROM WHEN THE RAILROAD CAME IN THE 1870S UP UNTIL THE 1930S. LOS ANGELES WAS HOME TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN 1932 AND 1984. IT WILL HOST THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN 2028. THREE TIMES THE CITY BROKE OUT IN RIOTS IN IN 1965 AND IN 1992 ALL OF WHICH MOTIVATED BY RACE BASED INJUSTICE AGAINST MINORITIES. IN 1994 AN EARTHQUAKE KILLED 72 PEOPLE AND DAMAGED MANY BUILDINGS.
LOS ANGELES IS A VERY LARGE CITY AND THE EDGES OF THE CITY ARE VERY FAR FROM THE CENTER GOING FROM THE BEACHES TO THE MOUNTAINS. THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS RUN THROUGH THE CITY SEPARATING IT INTO THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY TO THE NORTH AND THE LOS ANGELES BASIN TO THE SOUTH. THE LOS ANGELES RIVER ALSO RUNS THROUGH THE CITY SOME. LOS ANGELES MOVES ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH 6.3 MILLIMETERS TO THE EAST EVERY YEAR. IT IS CAUSED BY THE CITIES TECTONIC PLATES AND ROUGH GROUND GEOGRAPHY AND SINCE LOS ANGELES IS AT A CLOSE DISTANCE WITH THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT. THIS BRINGS LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO 2.5 INCHES CLOSER TOGETHER EACH YEAR.
THE CLIMATE IN LOS ANGELES IS A MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE. THE WEATHER IS USUALLY WARM AND DRY DURING THE SUMMER AND IT IS MILD AND MORE RAINY IN THE WINTER. THE WEATHER IS DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON HOW FAR AWAY FROM THE OCEAN YOU ARE SO PLACES NEAR THE BEACH USUALLY DO NOT GET AS HOT IN THE SUMMER. IT IS VERY RARE FOR TEMPERATURES TO GO BELOW FREEZING. THE CITY RECEIVES ABOUT 15 INCHES 386 MM OF RAIN EACH YEAR ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT CAN CHANGE A LOT FROM YEAR TO YEAR.
L.A. HAS MANY FAMOUS SIGHTS. THERE ARE MANY VERY LONG BEACHES SUCH AS VENICE BEACH. MANY VISITORS GO TO HOLLYWOOD HOME TO THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME AND THE MANN S GRAUMAN S CHINESE THEATER A LARGE CINEMA. LOS ANGELES ALSO HAS MANY FINE MUSEUMS SUCH AS THE L.A. COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART AND THE GETTY MUSEUM. ANOTHER SIGHT IS THE LOS ANGELES CITY ZOO. LOS ANGELES IS THE ONLY MAJOR CITY IN THE WORLD WITH AN ACTIVE POPULATION OF WILD MOUNTAIN LIONS.
LOS ANGELES IS KNOWN FOR ITS LARGE MOVIE AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY. MUCH OF THIS IS LOCATED IN HOLLYWOOD. SOME MILITARY AIRCRAFT ARE ALSO MADE THERE. THE MUSIC INDUSTRY IS ALSO CONCENTRATED IN THE AREA. THE CITY IS ALSO A BANKING CENTER. THE SAN PEDRO AREA HAS A BUSY PORT.
LOS ANGELES HAS DOZENS OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND NAMED AREAS INCLUDING 
THE CURRENT MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES IS ERIC GARCETTI.
MAMMAL
MAMMALS ARE A GROUP OF VERTEBRATE ANIMALS WHICH FORM THE CLASS MAMMALIA. THEY HAVE FUR OR HAIR AND A VERY PRECISE KIND OF TEMPERATURE REGULATION. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE MONOTREMES ALL MAMMALS BEAR LIVE YOUNG. THEY ALSO PRODUCE MILK FOR THE YOUNG. PARENTAL CARE OF THE YOUNG IS UNIVERSAL AMONG MAMMALS AND IT IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE LIVE BIRTH LIMITS THE NUMBER OF OFFSPRING.
MOST MARSUPIAL AND EUTHERIAN MAMMALS HAVE A REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE KNOWN AS THE OESTROUS CYCLE U.S ESTROUS CYCLE. FEMALES ARE SEXUALLY ACTIVE ONLY DURING THE OESTROUS STAGE WHEN THEY ARE ON HEAT FOR A FEW DAYS EACH MONTH. IF AN OVUM IS NOT FERTILIZED THE ENDOMETRIUM UTERUS LINING IS RESORBED. OESTRUS CYCLES MAY OCCUR ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR OR MANY TIMES A YEAR. EACH GROUP OF MAMMALS HAS ITS OWN FREQUENCY.
HUMANS AND PRIMATES ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. THEY HAVE A MENSTRUAL CYCLE. IN THIS CASE FEMALES ARE SEXUALLY RECEPTIVE AT ANY TIME BUT ONLY FERTILE WHEN AN OVUM IS RELEASED FROM AN OVARY. IN THIS CASE THE ENDOMETRIUM IF NOT NEEDED FOR AN FERTILISED EGG IS DISCARDED. THE ENDOMETRIUM IS SHED AND TAKES WITH IT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF BLOOD. IN THIS SYSTEM EGGS ARE RELEASED FROM THE OVARIES MOSTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CYCLE AWAY FROM THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD. THIS OVULATION IS CONCEALED MEANING IT IS NOT OBVIOUS WHEN IT OCCURS. THIS PROCESS SO IT IS THOUGHT TENDS TO KEEP THE MALE AND FEMALE TOGETHER WHICH IS UNUSUAL IN MAMMALS WITH THE OESTROUS CYCLE.
ONE DIAGNOSTIC FEATURE IS THE LOWER JAW WHICH UNLIKE EARLIER FORMS IS COMPOSED OF A SINGLE BONE THE DENTARY. THIS IS ONE FEATURE WHICH CAN BE SEEN IN FOSSILS OR AT LEAST THOSE WHICH ARE COMPLETE ENOUGH TO HAVE THE LOWER JAW. MAMMALS HAVE THREE LITTLE BONES IN THEIR INNER EAR THE EAR OSSICLES. THE EAR OSSICLES ARE BONES WHICH WERE LONG AGO PART OF THE LOWER JAW IN EARLY PROTO MAMMALS.
THERE ARE QUITE A NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES PARTICULARLY IN THE SKULL AND LIMBS SO THAT IT IS USUALLY POSSIBLE IDENTIFY AND DESCRIBE A MAMMAL FROM ITS SKELETON ALONE.
ANOTHER DIAGNOSTIC FEATURE IS THE NEOCORTEX OF THE BRAIN WHICH NO OTHER VERTEBRATE HAS. THIS IS INVOLVED IN THE KIND OF FLEXIBLE BEHAVIOR AND LEARNING TYPICAL OF MAMMALS. REPTILES AND BIRDS HAVE MUCH OF THEIR BEHAVIOR CONTROLLED BY INHERITED BEHAVIOR CHAINS WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATES AS INSTINCTS. ALMOST ALL ANIMALS CAN DO SOME LEARNING BUT MAMMALS DO FAR MORE THAN OTHER VERTEBRATES. THEIR BEHAVIOR IS MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE THAN LIZARDS FOR EXAMPLE AND THAT IS MADE POSSIBLE BY THEIR NEOCORTEX.
OTHER THINGS IN THE LIFE OF MAMMALS SEEM TO BE CONNECTED WITH THIS FLEXIBILITY AND LEARNING. PLAY IS A KIND OF EARLY LEARNING PERIOD IN WHICH ACCORDING TO ONE THEORY MAMMALS DEVELOP SKILLS WHICH THEY WILL NEED IN LIFE. ALL MAMMALIAN YOUNG PLAY AND THIS IS VERY OBVIOUS IN THE MORE INTELLIGENT MAMMALS PRIMATES CATS.
THE EMOTIONS OF MAMMALS ARE VERY NOTICEABLE AND RATHER SIMILAR TO OURS. IT IS POSSIBLE AND QUITE COMMON FOR HUMANS TO HAVE A FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER MAMMAL. IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A HUMAN TO HAVE ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH A SNAKE OR A GECKO FOR EXAMPLE. THIS IS BECAUSE THE REPTILE SIMPLY DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME BASIC EMOTIONS AS A HUMAN.
THERE ARE ABOUT 50 CHARACTERS WHICH ARE TYPICAL OF MAMMALS AND SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE DISCUSSED ABOVE. A FEW MORE EXAMPLES WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT MAMMALS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM REPTILES AND BIRDS 
IN THE LANGUAGE OF CLADISTICS THESE 50 UNIQUE CHARACTERS ARE APOMORPHIES WHICH PROVE THAT MAMMALS ARE A CLADE DESCENDED FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR.
ALMOST ALL MAMMALS GIVE BIRTH TO LIVE YOUNG. THERE ARE ONLY TWO MAMMALS THAT LAY EGGS CALLED MONOTREMES THE DUCK BILLED PLATYPUS ORNITHORHYNCHUS AND THE SPINY ANTEATER ECHIDNA WITH FOUR SPECIES. ALL ARE CONFINED TO AUSTRALIA AND NEW GUINEA AND ARE THE SOLE SURVIVORS OF AN EARLIER GROUP OF MAMMALS. HOWEVER LIKE OTHER MAMMALS THEY FEED MILK TO THEIR YOUNG AND PROTECT AND LOOK AFTER THEM.
OTHER MAMMALS ARE DIVIDED INTO THE MARSUPIALS AND THE EUTHERIA THE PLACENTAL MAMMALS. MARSUPIALS ARE MAMMALS WITH POUCHES TO CARRY YOUNG IN LIKE THE KANGAROO.
IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF SPECIES MAMMALS WITH 5488 SPECIES ARE NOT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL VERTEBRATES. BIRDS WITH ABOUT 10 000 SPECIES HAVE NEARLY TWICE AS MANY AND REPTILES HAVE JUST AS MANY AS BIRDS. FISH HAVE EVEN MORE SPECIES. THERE ARE 27 000 SPECIES OF FISH OF WHICH NEARLY 26 000 ARE BONY FISH.
DESPITE THIS MANY ZOOLOGISTS DO REGARD MAMMALS AS A SUCCESSFUL GROUP OF ANIMALS. ONE REASON IS THAT THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ALL HABITATS ON EARTH. IN THE AIR IN THE WATER IN FORESTS IN THE COLDER REGIONS OF THE WORLD AND ABOVE ALL ON GRASSLANDS WHERE THEY ARE OUTSTANDINGLY SUCCESSFUL.
IN THE AIR THE BATS CHIROPTERA ARE THE MAMMALIAN ORDER WITH THE MOST SPECIES. THEY OWN THE NIGHTTIME SINCE BIRDS ARE LARGELY DIURNAL DAYTIME ANIMALS. BATS ARE HUGELY SUCCESSFUL MOSTLY AS NIGHTTIME PREDATORS OF INSECTS.
SEAGOING MAMMALS THE CETACEA AND THE PINNIPEDS ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL AND SIGNIFICANT PREDATORS. THIS INCLUDES THE WHALES SEALS WALRUS DOLPHINS AND OTHERS.
THE TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS ARE FEWER IN NUMBER OF SPECIES THAN LIZARDS BUT THEY ARE HUGE IN INDIVIDUAL NUMBERS AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT IN THE LIFE OF THE TERRESTRIAL BIOMES. THEIR ABILITY TO MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND ADAPT HAS MADE THEM A MOST EFFECTIVE GROUP. MANY MAMMALS LIVE IN COLD PLACES. THESE MAMMALS HAVE THICK HAIR OR BLUBBER TO KEEP THEM WARM. OTHERS MAY LIVE IN RAINFORESTS. ON LAND THE RODENTS RATS MICE ARE HUGELY SUCCESSFUL MORE COMMON IN NUMBERS THAN ANY OTHER MAMMALS. LARGE MAMMALS ON LAND HAVE BEEN HUNTED TO EXTINCTION IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD BUT THE ONES WHICH REMAIN ARE NOW BETTER PROTECTED.
LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST ARE THE PRIMATES. THEIR NATURAL HABITAT WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS ARE THE FORESTS. MOST LIVE IN THE TREES WITH HANDS THAT GRASP GOOD COLOUR VISION AND INTELLIGENCE. IN THE PLIOCENE PERIOD SOME MOVED OUT ONTO THE SAVANNAHS AS GRASSLAND REPLACED FORESTS. MANKIND IS THE RESULT OF THIS SHIFT INTO THE SAVANNAHS.
THE EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS AMONG LAND VERTEBRATES IS AS FOLLOWS 
THIS SORT OF CLASSIFICATION IS NOT TRADITIONAL BUT IT DOES REFLECT OUR KNOWLEDGE OF PALAEONTOLOGY AND EVOLUTION.
A SOMEWHAT STANDARDIZED CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY MOST CURRENT MAMMALOGY CLASSROOM TEXTBOOKS. IT IS BASED ON LIVING ANIMALS. THE FOLLOWING TAXONOMY OF EXTANT AND RECENTLY EXTINCT MAMMALS IS FROM VAUGHAN ET AL. 2000.
CLASS MAMMALIA
MAMMALS CAN BE DIVIDED IN A NUMBER OF ORDERS 
MARSUPIAL
MARSUPIALS ARE THE MAIN PART OF AN INFRACLASS OF MAMMALS CALLED THE METATHERIA. THIS CONSISTS OF THE MARSUPIALS AND THEIR EXTINCT ANCESTORS.
MARSUPIALS GIVE BIRTH TO LIVING BABIES. THE BABIES ARE CALLED JOEYS. THE BABIES FEED ON MILK. THEIR BABIES ARE BORN VERY SMALL. 
MARSUPIALS HAVE A SPECIAL POUCH WHERE THEY CARRY THEIR BABIES. AFTER THE BIRTH THE BABY GOES INTO ITS MOTHER S POUCH WHERE IT CAN DRINK MILK AND IS KEPT WARM AND SAFE. WHEN THE BABIES ARE YOUNG THEY STAY IN THE POUCH ALL THE TIME BUT WHEN THEY ARE OLDER THEY CAN LEAVE IT FOR SHORT TIMES. WHEN THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH AND TOO BIG FOR THE POUCH THEY DO NOT GO INTO THEIR MOTHER S POUCH ANYMORE.
MARSUPIALS EVOLVED BEFORE THE SOUTHERN SUPERCONTINENT GONDWANA BROKE OFF FROM PANGAEA 100 MILLION YEARS AGO. EARLY MARSUPIAL FOSSILS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN ASIA FROM 125 MILLION YEARS AGO. 
THEY WERE OUTCOMPETED ON LAURASIA BY PLACENTAL MAMMALS BUT THE PLACENTALS DID NOT GET INTO THE AUSTRALASIAN PART OF GONDWANA BEFORE IT BROKE AWAY INTO A SEPARATE SUPERCONTINENT. THAT IS WHY MARSUPIALS NOW FOUND NATIVE ONLY ON THE SOUTHERN CONTINENTS OF AUSTRALASIA AND SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA WITH THE SINGLE EXCEPTION OF THE VIRGINIA OPOSSUM. 
SOME OF THE 100 LIVING SPECIES OF SOUTH AMERICAN MARSUPIALS HAVE MIGRATED NORTH 13 SPECIES TO CENTRAL AMERICA AND ONE TO NORTH AMERICA. 
THERE ARE 334 SPECIES OF LIVING AUSTRALASIAN MARSUPIALS. THEY ARE MOSTLY IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW GUINEA AND SOME ARE ON THE SMALLER ISLANDS.
IN MORE RECENT TIMES THE LAND BRIDGE BETWEEN THE AMERICAS AND REINTRODUCTIONS TO AUSTRALIA HAVE BROUGHT IN PLACENTAL MAMMALS. THEY HAVE CAUSED THE RECENT EXTINCTION OF MANY MARSUPIAL SPECIES.
THE EXTINCT GENUS YALKAPARIDON ORDER YALKAPARIDONTIA IS A BIZARRE FOSSIL FOUND IN THE OLIGOCENE MIOCENE DEPOSITS OF RIVERSLEIGH NE AUSTRALIA. ITS TEETH ARE SO STRANGE THAT PALAEONTOLOGISTS CALL IT A THINGODONT.
THE BORHYAENIDS AND THE SABERTOOTH THYLACOSMILUS ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED TO BE MARSUPIALS. THEY ARE SPARASSODONT METATHERIANS THE SISTER GROUP OF THE MARSUPIALS.
MATHEMATICS
MATHEMATICS IS THE STUDY OF NUMBERS SHAPES AND PATTERNS. THE WORD IS SOMETIMES SHORTENED TO MATHS IN ENGLAND AUSTRALIA IRELAND AND NEW ZEALAND OR MATH IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. MATHEMATICS IS USEFUL FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS THAT OCCUR IN THE REAL WORLD SO MANY PEOPLE BESIDES MATHEMATICIANS STUDY AND USE MATHEMATICS. TODAY SOME MATHEMATICS IS NEEDED IN MANY JOBS. BUSINESS SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION NEED SOME KNOWLEDGE OF MATHEMATICS.
MATHEMATICS SOLVES PROBLEMS BY USING LOGIC. MATHEMATICIANS OFTEN USE DEDUCTION. DEDUCTION IS A SPECIAL WAY OF THINKING TO DISCOVER AND PROVE NEW TRUTHS USING OLD TRUTHS. TO A MATHEMATICIAN THE REASON SOMETHING IS TRUE IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE FACT THAT IT IS TRUE. USING DEDUCTION IS WHAT MAKES MATHEMATICS THINKING DIFFERENT FROM OTHER KINDS OF THINKING. MATHEMATICS INCLUDES THE STUDY OF 
MATHEMATICS USES LOGIC PAPER AND CALCULATOR. THESE THINGS ARE USED TO CREATE GENERAL RULES WHICH ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF MATHEMATICS. THESE RULES LEAVE OUT INFORMATION THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT SO THAT A SINGLE RULE CAN COVER MANY SITUATIONS. BY FINDING GENERAL RULES MATHEMATICS SOLVES MANY PROBLEMS AT THE SAME TIME AS THESE RULES CAN BE USED ON OTHER PROBLEMS.
A PROOF GIVES A REASON WHY A RULE IN MATHEMATICS IS CORRECT. THIS IS DONE BY USING CERTAIN OTHER RULES THAT EVERYONE AGREES ARE CORRECT WHICH ARE CALLED AXIOMS. A RULE THAT HAS A PROOF IS SOMETIMES CALLED A THEOREM. EXPERTS IN MATHEMATICS PERFORM RESEARCH TO CREATE NEW THEOREMS. SOMETIMES EXPERTS FIND AN IDEA THAT THEY THINK IS A THEOREM BUT CANNOT FIND A PROOF FOR IT. THAT IDEA IS CALLED A CONJECTURE UNTIL A PROOF IS FOUND OR IT S PROVEN TO BE INCORRECT.
SOMETIMES MATHEMATICS FINDS AND STUDIES RULES OR IDEAS IN THE REAL WORLD THAT WE DON T UNDERSTAND YET. OFTEN IN MATHEMATICS IDEAS AND RULES ARE CHOSEN BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSIDERED SIMPLE OR NEAT. ON THE OTHER HAND SOMETIMES THESE IDEAS AND RULES ARE FOUND IN THE REAL WORLD AFTER THEY ARE STUDIED IN MATHEMATICS THIS HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES IN THE PAST. IN GENERAL STUDYING THE RULES AND IDEAS OF MATHEMATICS CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND THE WORLD BETTER.
THESE THEOREMS HAVE INTERESTED MATHEMATICIANS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT MATHEMATICIANS.
THESE ARE THEOREMS AND CONJECTURES THAT HAVE GREATLY CHANGED MATHEMATICS.
PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF MATHEMATICS ALSO INFLUENCES THE WAY MATHEMATICIANS STUDY THEIR SUBJECT.
MATHEMATICS IN HISTORY AND THE HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS.
THE WORD MATHEMATICS COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD M THEMA. THE GREEK WORD MEANS SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE OR LEARNING.
OFTEN THE WORD MATHEMATICS IS MADE SHORTER INTO MATHS IN BRITISH ENGLISH OR MATH IN AMERICAN ENGLISH. THE SHORT WORDS MATHS OR MATH ARE OFTEN USED FOR ARITHMETIC GEOMETRY OR SIMPLE ALGEBRA BY STUDENTS AND THEIR SCHOOLS.
THERE IS NO NOBEL PRIZE IN MATHEMATICS. MATHEMATICIANS CAN RECEIVE THE ABEL PRIZE AND THE FIELDS MEDAL FOR IMPORTANT WORKS.
THE CLAY MATHEMATICS INSTITUTE HAS SAID IT WILL GIVE ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO ANYONE WHO SOLVES ONE OF THE MILLENNIUM PRIZE PROBLEMS
THERE ARE MANY TOOLS THAT ARE USED TO DO MATHEMATICS OR TO FIND ANSWERS TO MATHEMATICS PROBLEMS.
MAYAN CIVILIZATION
THE MAYA CIVILIZATION WERE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN MESOAMERICA WITH MAYA LANGUAGES AND MAYA RELIGION. THEY LIVED THERE FOR A LONG TIME AND SOME OF THE MAYA PEOPLE LIVE THERE EVEN TODAY.
THE MAYA LIVED THERE 4 000 YEARS AGO ABOUT 2000 BC. AT THAT DATE COMPLEX SOCIETIES WERE LIVING IN THE MAYA REGION. THE STAPLE FOODS OF THE MAYA DIET WERE CULTIVATED. THEIR FOOD INCLUDED MAIZE BEANS SQUASHES AND CHILI PEPPERS. THE FIRST MAYA CITIES DEVELOPED AROUND 750 BC.
THE MAYA PEOPLE USED A WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND A NUMERAL SYSTEM. THEY WERE GOOD AT ART BUILDING AND MATH. THEIR PRIESTS STUDIED STARS AND PLANETS WHICH HELPED THEM MAKE CALENDARS.
THE MAYA CIVILIZATION WAS BIGGEST BETWEEN THE YEARS OF 420 AD AND 900 AD. THE MAYA CIVILIZATION SPREAD ALL THE WAY FROM CENTRAL MEXICO TO HONDURAS GUATEMALA AND NORTHERN EL SALVADOR. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT AT ITS MAXIMUM THE CIVILIZATION HAD AT LEAST TEN MILLION PEOPLE. THE MAYA PEOPLE TRADED WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN THE AMERICAS. THEIR ART AND BUILDINGS HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT STYLES. THIS SHOWS THEY TRADED A LOT. THEY MADE CHANGES TO THEIR BUILDINGS TO MAKE THEM EVEN BETTER. THE MAYA CIVILIZATION STARTED GETTING SMALLER AFTER 900 AD.
THE CONQUISTADORS ARRIVED IN THE 15TH CENTURY AND TOOK OVER MEXICO AND LATER CENTRAL AMERICA EVEN IN THE MAYAN AREAS. HOWEVER THE MAYA PEOPLE STILL LIVE THERE TODAY. THEY LIVE IN THE SAME AREAS THE MAYAN CIVILIZATION USED TO LIVE IN. THEY KEEP THE OLD MAYAN TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS.
THERE ARE MANY MAYAN LANGUAGES STILL SPOKEN TODAY INCLUDING ONE CALLED THE ACHI LANGUAGE. A PLAY CALLED RABINAL ACHI IS CONSIDERED IMPORTANT.
THE MAYA CIVILIZATION LIVED IN THREE DIFFERENT AREAS THE SOUTHERN MAYA HIGHLANDS THE CENTRAL LOWLANDS AND THE NORTHERN LOWLANDS. THEY HAD MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF LAND INCLUDING MOUNTAINS AND DRY PLAINS. PEOPLE LIVING IN THE LOW PLAINS BY THE SEA WERE AFFECTED BY HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS FROM THE CARIBBEAN.
THE AREA COVERED WHAT WE NOW CALL THE SOUTHERN MEXICAN STATES OF CHIAPAS AND TABASCO AND THE YUCAT N PENINSULA STATES OF QUINTANA ROO CAMPECHE AND YUCAT N. THEY ALSO INCLUDED WHERE WE NOW CALL GUATEMALA BELIZE EL SALVADOR AND WESTERN HONDURAS.
THE FIRST MAYA SETTLEMENTS STARTED ABOUT 1800 BC. THEY LIVED IN THE SOCONUSCO REGION NOW THE STATE OF CHIAPAS IN MEXICO ON THE PACIFIC OCEAN. THIS IS CALLED THE EARLY PRE CLASSIC PERIOD IN MAYAN HISTORY. PEOPLE IN CENTRAL AMERICA HAD BEEN NOMADS WHO WENT FROM PLACE TO PLACE TO FIND FOOD AND SHELTER. AROUND THIS TIME THEY BEGAN TO SETTLE DOWN.THEY STARTED TO FARM ANIMALS AND MAKE POTTERY AND SMALL CLAY FIGURES. THEY BURIED THEIR DEAD IN SIMPLE BURIAL MOUNDS. LATER THEY STARTED TO MAKE THESE MOUNDS INTO STEP PYRAMIDS.
THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND AT THE TIME ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH. THE OLMEC THE MIXE ZOQUE AND ZAPOTEC CIVILIZATIONS MOSTLY LIVED IN THE AREA WE NOW CALL OAXACA. WE DON T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE BORDERS OF THE MAYA CIVILIZATION WERE. MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EARLY EXAMPLES OF WRITING AND BUILDINGS APPEARED IN NORTH SO THESE CULTURES PROBABLY AFFECTED THE MAYA CIVILIZATION.
FROM ABOUT 250 TO 909 THE MAYA CIVILIZATION BUILT MANY MONUMENTS AND CITIES AND MADE LOTS OF IMPORTANT CARVINGS. THE SOUTHERN LOWLANDS WERE AN IMPORTANT PLACE AT THE TIME. THE MAYA CIVILIZATION MADE LOTS OF DISCOVERIES ABOUT ART AND THINKING THERE.
LIKE ANCIENT GREECE THEIR CIVILIZATION WAS MADE UP OF LOTS OF CITIES WHICH ALL WORKED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. PEOPLE GATHERED AROUND THESE CITIES TO FARM. WELL KNOWN CITIES WERE TIKAL PALENQUE COP N AND CALAKMUL. LESSER KNOWN CITIES WERE DOS PILAS UAXACTUN ALTUN HA AND BONAMPAK AMONG OTHERS. IN GENERAL WE KNOW MORE ABOUT WHERE THE CITIES WERE IN THE SOUTH THAN WE DO IN THE NORTH. SOME NORTHERN CITIES WE DO KNOW ABOUT WERE OXKINTOK CHUNCHUCMIL AND UXMAL.
THEIR MOST FAMOUS MONUMENTS ARE THE PYRAMIDS THEY BUILT AS PART OF THEIR RELIGIOUS CENTERS AND THE PALACES. THE PALACE AT CANCU N IS THE LARGEST WE KNOW ABOUT IN THE MAYA AREA. THE MAYA ALSO MADE CARVED STONE SLABS WHICH THEY CALLED TETUN OR TREE STONES. THESE SLABS SHOW RULERS ALONG WITH HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING DESCRIBING THEIR FAMILY MILITARY VICTORIES AND OTHER THINGS THAT THEY DID WELL.
THE MAYA HAD TRADE ROUTES THAT RAN OVER LONG DISTANCES. THEY TRADED WITH MANY OTHER MESOAMERICAN CULTURES SUCH AS TEOTIHUACAN THE ZAPOTEC AND OTHER GROUPS IN CENTRAL AND GULF COAST MEXICO. THEY ALSO TRADED WITH GROUPS THAT WERE FARTHER AWAY. FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE WHO STUDY THE MAYA CIVILIZATION FOUND GOLD FROM PANAMA IN THE SACRED WELL AT CHICHEN ITZA.
SOME IMPORTANT THINGS THEY TRADED WERE CACAO SALT SEA SHELLS JADE AND OBSIDIAN.
BETWEEN 900 AD AND 1000 AD THE CITIES IN THE SOUTHERN LOWLANDS HAD MORE AND MORE PROBLEMS UNTIL ALL THE PEOPLE LEFT. THE MAYA CIVILIZATION THERE STOPPED MAKING BIG MONUMENTS AND CARVINGS. PEOPLE WHO STUDY THE MAYA CIVILIZATION ARE NOT SURE WHY THIS HAPPENED. THEY HAVE MANY DIFFERENT IDEAS SOME PEOPLE THINK THERE WAS A BIG ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER OR A DISEASE AFFECTED A LOT OF PEOPLE OR THERE WERE JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE FOR THE AMOUNT OF FOOD THEY COULD GROW.
IN THE NORTH THE MAYA CIVILIZATION KEPT GOING. OTHER CULTURES STARTED MIXING WITH MAYAN CULTURE MUCH MORE. SOME OF THE IMPORTANT SITES IN THIS TIME WERE CHICHEN ITZA UXMAL EDZN AND COBA. AT SOME POINT THE FAMILIES WHO RULED OVER CHICHEN AND UXMAL GOT WEAKER AND THE RULERS IN THE CITY OF MAYAPAN RULED ALL OF THE MAYAN CIVILIZATION IN THE YUCAT N PENINSULA UNTIL THERE WAS A REVOLT IN 1450. AFTER THE REVOLT THE WHOLE AREA BROKE UP INTO DIFFERENT CITIES WHO FOUGHT AGAINST EACH OTHER UNTIL THE SPANISH CONQUEST OF YUCAT N.
THE ITZA MAYA KO WOJ AND YALAIN GROUPS AROUND WHAT IS NOW GUATAMELA WERE STILL AROUND BUT THERE WEREN T VERY MANY OF THEM. BY 1520 THEY HAD BUILT THEMSELVES BACK UP AGAIN AND STARTED TO BUILD CITIES. THE ITZA HAD THEIR CAPITAL AT TAYASAL ALSO KNOWN AS NOH PET N AND PEOPLE WHO STUDY THE MAYA CIVLISATION THINK WHAT S LEFT OF THIS CITY IS BELOW THE MODERN CITY OF FLORES GUATEMALA ON LAKE PET N ITZ. THE KO WOJ HAD THEIR CAPITAL AT ZACPETEN. SOME MAYAN CULTURES WERE STILL LIVING IN THE SOUTHERN HIGHLANDS.
THE QUICH KINGDOM PRODUCED THE MOST FAMOUS MAYAN WORK THE POPOL VUH. IT TALKS ABOUT THE CREATION OF THE WORLD THE MAYAN GODS AND GODDESSES HOW HUMANS AND ANIMALS WERE CREATED AND WHY THE QUICH KINGDOM WAS THE BEST ONE IN THE MAYA CIVILIZATION.
THE SPANISH STARTED TO CONQUER MAYA LANDS. IT TOOK THEM A LONG TIME 170 YEARS TO FINISH DOING THIS BECAUSE THE MAYANS HAD NO CAPITAL CITY AND EACH CITY HAD A DIFFERENT CULTURE. THE LAST MAYAN STATES THE ITZA CITY OF TAYASAL AND THE KO WOJ CITY OF ZACPETEN STILL HAD PEOPLE LIVING IN THEM LATE INTO THE 17TH CENTURY. THEY WERE FINALLY CONQUERED IN 1697.
THERE ARE STILL ABOUT 6 MILLION MAYA PEOPLE LIVING IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
MERCURY ELEMENT 
MERCURY ALSO KNOWN AS QUICKSILVER OR HYDRARGYRUM IS A CHEMICAL ELEMENT. ITS SYMBOL ON THE PERIODIC TABLE IS HG AND ITS ATOMIC NUMBER IS 80. ITS ATOMIC MASS IS 200.59.
THE SYMBOL HG STANDS FOR ITS LATINIZED GREEK NAME HYDRARGYRUM MEANING WATERY OR LIQUID SILVER.
NO ONE HAS THE CREDIT FOR FINDING MERCURY. IT WAS KNOWN IN ANCIENT TIMES. MERCURY WAS FOUND IN EGYPTIAN TOMBS THAT ARE FROM 2000 BC. 
CHINESE PEOPLE ALSO KNEW IT FROM LONG AGO. IN CHINA AND TIBET PEOPLE THOUGHT USING MERCURY WOULD MAKE THEM LIVE LONGER AND HAVE BETTER HEALTH. ONE OF CHINA S EMPERORS Q N SH HU NG D IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN BURIED IN A TOMB WITH RIVERS OF FLOWING MERCURY. HE DIED FROM DRINKING A MIXTURE OF MERCURY AND POWDERED JADE BECAUSE HE WANTED TO LIVE FOREVER. HOWEVER THIS ONLY MADE HIM DIE OF LIVER FAILURE POISONING AND BRAIN DEATH. THE ANCIENT GREEKS USED MERCURY IN OINTMENTS. THE EGYPTIANS AND THE ROMANS USED IT IN COSMETICS. THESE COSMETICS SOMETIMES HURT AND MADE FACES UGLIER.
MERCURY IS A SILVERY WHITE LIQUID POST TRANSITION METAL. THE REASON FOR MERCURY BEING A LIQUID IS COMPLEX. IT IS HEAVY A CHUNK OF IRON CAN FLOAT ON MERCURY. COMPARED TO OTHER METALS IT DOES NOT CONDUCT HEAT WELL. HOWEVER IT CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY FAIRLY WELL. MERCURY IS THE ONLY METAL WITH A KNOWN MELTING POINT 38.83 C LOWER THAN CAESIUM. MERCURY IS ONE OF THE TWO ELEMENTS THAT ARE LIQUIDS AT STANDARD TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE. BROMINE IS THE OTHER ONE.
MERCURY MAY BE SEEN AS A TRANSITION METAL BUT IT IS NORMALLY SEEN AS A POST TRANSITION METAL. IT IS IN GROUP 12 OF THE PERIODIC TABLE. MERCURY HAS SEVEN STABLE NONRADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES. HG IS THE MOST COMMON ISOTOPE. MERCURY MAKES A BLUE TO ULTRAVIOLET COLOR IN A TUBE WHEN A SPARK IS PASSED THROUGH IT. THE ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT CAN KILL GERMS OR LIGHT FLUORESCENT LAMPS.
MERCURY IS AN UNREACTIVE METAL. IT DOES NOT CORRODE IN AIR UNLESS HYDROGEN SULFIDE IS ALSO THERE SIMILAR TO SILVER. MERCURY CAN OXIDIZE TO MERCURY II OXIDE WHEN HEATED IN AIR. IF IT IS HEATED FURTHER IT DECOMPOSES INTO MERCURY AND OXYGEN AGAIN. IT DOES NOT DISSOLVE IN ORDINARY ACIDS BUT CAN DISSOLVE IN OXIDIZING ACIDS TO MAKE MERCURY SALTS. IT CAN MAKE AMALGAMS WHEN MIXED WITH MOST METALS LIKE ALUMINIUM GOLD AND ZINC. IRON TANTALUM TUNGSTEN AND PLATINUM DO NOT MAKE AMALGAMS WITH MERCURY. IRON FLASKS WERE USED TO TRADE MERCURY BECAUSE OF THIS.
MERCURY CAN DISSOLVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF ALUMINIUM METAL MAKING IT DANGEROUS TO TRANSPORT IN ALUMINIUM CONTAINERS. THE THIN LAYER OF OXIDE ON ALUMINIUM STOPS IT FROM AMALGAMATING MAKING AN AMALGAM WITH ALUMINIUM BUT THE OXIDE COATING CAN BE DAMAGED TO EXPOSE THE METAL. THEN THE ALUMINIUM METAL IS DISSOLVED AND OXIDIZES TO ALUMINIUM OXIDE. THE ALUMINIUM OXIDE FORMS A SOLID AND RELEASES THE MERCURY WHICH AMALGAMATES MORE ALUMINIUM. THIS PROCESS KEEPS REPEATING UNTIL A LARGE AMOUNT OF ALUMINIUM IS DISSOLVED.
MERCURY FORMS CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS IN 2 OXIDATION STATES 1 AND 2. MERCURY I COMPOUNDS ARE WEAK OXIDIZING AGENTS AND WEAK REDUCING AGENTS. MOST OF THEM ARE COLORLESS. THEY EASILY DISPROPORTIONATE TO MERCURY II COMPOUNDS AND MERCURY METAL. THEY REACT WITH OXYGEN IN THE AIR TO MAKE MERCURY II COMPOUNDS. MANY MERCURY I COMPOUNDS DO NOT DISSOLVE IN WATER. MERCURY I CHLORIDE IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MERCURY I COMPOUNDS. MERCURY II COMPOUNDS ARE STRONG OXIDIZING AGENTS AND VERY CORROSIVE. MERCURY II COMPOUNDS ARE RED YELLOW OR COLORLESS. MERCURY II OXIDE AND MERCURY II CHLORIDE ARE THE MOST COMMON MERCURY II COMPOUNDS IN THE LABORATORY.
ONE THING THEY HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THEY ARE ALL TOXIC. THE SOLUBLE ONES ARE MORE TOXIC THAN THE INSOLUBLE ONES.
ALSO KNOWN AS MERCUROUS COMPOUNDS THESE ARE WEAK REDUCING AGENTS AND WEAK OXIDIZING AGENTS. MOST OF THEM DO NOT DISSOLVE IN WATER MAKING THEM LESS TOXIC THAN MERCURY II COMPOUNDS. MOST OF THEM ARE COLORLESS OR YELLOW.
ALSO KNOWN AS MERCURIC COMPOUNDS THESE ARE STRONG OXIDIZING AGENTS. MOST OF THEM DISSOLVE IN WATER MAKING THEM VERY TOXIC. THEY ARE COLORLESS OR RED.
THESE CONTAIN MERCURY REACTED WITH A ORGANIC MOLECULE. THEY ARE EVEN MORE TOXIC THAN OTHER MERCURY COMPOUNDS SINCE THEY GET ABSORBED VERY EASILY.
MERCURY IS A RARE METAL. IT IS ABOUT AS COMMON AS SILVER. MERCURY IS NOT EXPENSIVE LIKE SILVER BECAUSE THE MERCURY IS VERY EASY TO GET FROM THE PLACES WHERE IT IS FOUND. MERCURY CAN BE FOUND IN ELEMENTAL LIQUID FORM IN NATURE BUT THIS IS NOT COMMON. MERCURY AS AN ELEMENT IS THE ONLY LIQUID THAT IS RECOGNIZED AS A MINERAL BY THE INTERNATIONAL MINERALOGICAL ASSOCIATION. IT IS MOST OFTEN FOUND IN THE FORM OF CINNABAR A MERCURY II SULFIDE MINERAL. THE BIGGEST DEPOSITS OF CINNABAR USED TO BE FOUND IN SPAIN BUT NOW ARE FOUND IN CHINA. IT ALSO OCCURS IN OTHER MINERALS LIKE CALOMEL A MERCURY I CHLORIDE MINERAL.
CHINA AND KYRGYZSTAN ARE THE TWO MAIN MAKERS OF MERCURY. MINES IN ITALY THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO HAVE BEEN CLOSED. CHINA IS OPENING MORE MINES BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN UNION WANTS TO USE FLUORESCENT LIGHTS WHICH NEED MERCURY.
MERCURY IS MADE BY ROASTING CINNABAR IN A FURNACE. THE SULFIDE IS OXIDIZED TO SULFUR DIOXIDE LEAVING MERCURY BEHIND.
MERCURY HAS BEEN USED IN DENTAL FILLINGS UNTIL IT WAS REPLACED WITH SAFER MATERIALS. THEY ARE AN AMALGAM OF MERCURY WITH ANOTHER ELEMENT. AN ORGANIC MERCURY COMPOUND CALLED THIOMERSAL IS USED TO PRESERVE VACCINES. MERBROMIN ANOTHER ORGANIC MERCURY COMPOUND IS USED AS AN ANTISEPTIC. IT HAS BEEN BANNED IN SOME COUNTRIES LIKE THE US.
MERCURY I CHLORIDE ALSO KNOWN AS CALOMEL OR MERCUROUS CHLORIDE HAS BEEN USED AS A DIURETIC SKIN DISINFECTANT AND LAXATIVE. TOGETHER WITH OTHER MERCURY COMPOUNDS MERCURY II CHLORIDE ALSO KNOWN AS MERCURIC CHLORIDE OR CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE WAS USED TO TREAT SYPHILIS. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS WAS THAT MERCURY II CHLORIDE IS VERY TOXIC. SOMETIMES THE SYMPTOMS OF ITS TOXICITY WERE CONFUSED WITH THOSE OF THE SYPHILIS IT WAS BELIEVED TO TREAT. IT IS ALSO USED AS A DISINFECTANT. A PILL OR SYRUP IN WHICH MERCURY IS THE MAIN INGREDIENT WAS PRESCRIBED THROUGHOUT THE 1800S FOR DIFFERENT CONDITIONS SUCH AS CONSTIPATION DEPRESSION CHILD BEARING AND TOOTHACHES. IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY MERCURY WAS GIVEN TO CHILDREN ONCE A YEAR AS A LAXATIVE AND DEWORMER. TEETHING POWDERS FOR INFANTS ALSO HAD IT IN THEM. 
SINCE THE 1930S SOME VACCINES HAVE CONTAINED THE PRESERVATIVE THIOMERSAL. IN THE BODY THIS IS CHANGED TO ETHYLMERCURY. AT FIRST IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THIS MERCURY BASED PRESERVATIVE CAN CAUSE OR TRIGGER AUTISM IN CHILDREN BUT SCIENTIFIC STUDIES COULD NOT SHOW SUCH A LINK. BECAUSE OF THIS THIOMERSAL HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM MOST U.S. VACCINES RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN SIX YEARS OF AGE AND UNDER. THERE ARE CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE FOR INFLUENZA VACCINES. IN SOME CASES VACCINES MAY STILL HAVE VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF THIOMERSAL IN THEM.
CINNABAR IS STILL AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE TIBETAN AND AYURVEDIC MEDICINE. CERTAIN COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE USE OF MERCURY OR ITS COMPOUNDS IN DRUGS. FOR THIS REASON CINNABAR HAS RECENTLY BEEN REPLACED WITH LESS TOXIC PRODUCTS. 
TODAY THE USE OF MERCURY IN MEDICINE HAS GREATLY DECLINED IN ALL RESPECTS ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. THERMOMETERS AND BLOOD PRESSURE DEVICES USING MERCURY WERE INVENTED IN THE EARLY 18TH AND LATE 19TH CENTURIES RESPECTIVELY. NOW THEIR USE IS DECLINING AND HAS BEEN BANNED IN SOME COUNTRIES STATES AND MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. IN 2002 THE U.S. SENATE PASSED LEGISLATION TO PHASE OUT THE SALE OF NON PRESCRIPTION MERCURY THERMOMETERS. IN 2003 WASHINGTON AND MAINE BECAME THE FIRST STATES TO BAN MERCURY BLOOD PRESSURE DEVICES. MERCURY COMPOUNDS ARE IN SOME OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS INCLUDING TOPICAL ANTISEPTICS STIMULANT LAXATIVES DIAPER RASH OINTMENT EYE DROPS AND NASAL SPRAYS. THE FDA HAS INADEQUATE DATA TO ESTABLISH GENERAL RECOGNITION OF THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERCURY IN THESE PRODUCTS. MERCURY IS STILL USED IN SOME DIURETICS ALTHOUGH OTHER THINGS CAN BE USED FOR MOST THERAPEUTIC USES.
MERCURY IS ALSO USED 
IN 2017 THE WORLDWIDE USE OF MERCURY WAS LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT IT WAS IN 1980.
MERCURY IS LIQUID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND FUMES OF MERCURY ARE VERY POISONOUS. INGESTED ELEMENTAL MERCURY IS LESS DANGEROUS. THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS ARE ORGANIC MERCURY COMPOUNDS WHICH ARE EATEN WITH FOOD. HOWEVER INORGANIC COMPOUNDS SUCH AS MERCURY II NITRATE ARE ALSO HIGHLY TOXIC BY INGESTION EATING OR INHALATION BREATHING IN OF THE DUST. MERCURY CAN CAUSE BOTH CHRONIC AND ACUTE POISONING.
IN THE YEAR 1810 OVER 200 PEOPLE DIED OF MERCURY POISONING ON THE SHIP TRIUMPH BECAUSE A BARREL OF MERCURY HAD LEAKED. 
MERCURY IS EXTREMELY POISONOUS AND HAS TO BE USED CAREFULLY. WHEN MERCURY IS SPILLED THERE ARE SPECIAL WAYS TO CLEAN IT UP. SMALLER DROPS SHOULD BE COMBINED TO A LARGER DROP ON HARD SURFACES TO BE REMOVED MORE EASILY FOR EXAMPLE BEING PUSHED INTO A BAG THAT CAN BE THROWN AWAY. VACUUM CLEANERS AND BROOMS SHOULD NOT BE USED. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY CAN SPREAD MERCURY EVEN MORE. AFTERWARDS ELEMENTS SUCH AS SULFUR OR ZINC POWDER SHOULD BE SPRINKLED OVER THE PLACE THEN COLLECTED AND CLEANED AWAY. IT IS NOT EASY TO CLEAN MERCURY ENTIRELY OFF CLOTHING SO IT IS BETTER NOT TO USE THEM ANYMORE. BREATHING IN MERCURY VAPOR IS ALSO VERY DANGEROUS.
METAL
SOME CHEMICAL ELEMENTS ARE CALLED METALS. THEY ARE THE MAJORITY OF ELEMENTS IN THE PERIODIC TABLE. THESE ELEMENTS USUALLY HAVE THE FOLLOWING PROPERTIES 
MOST METALS ARE SOLID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE BUT THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THE CASE. MERCURY IS LIQUID. ALLOYS ARE MIXTURES WHERE AT LEAST ONE PART OF THE MIXTURE IS A METAL. EXAMPLES OF METALS ARE ALUMINIUM COPPER IRON TIN GOLD LEAD SILVER TITANIUM URANIUM AND ZINC. WELL KNOWN ALLOYS INCLUDE BRONZE AND STEEL. 
THE STUDY OF METALS IS CALLED METALLURGY.
MOST METALS ARE HARD SHINY THEY FEEL HEAVY AND THEY MELT ONLY WHEN THEY ARE HEATED AT VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES. LUMPS OF METAL WILL MAKE A BELL LIKE SOUND WHEN THEY ARE HIT WITH SOMETHING HEAVY THEY ARE SONOROUS.
HEAT AND ELECTRICITY CAN EASILY PASS THROUGH A METAL IT IS CONDUCTIVE. A LUMP OF METAL CAN BE BEATEN INTO A THIN SHEET IT IS MALLEABLE OR CAN BE PULLED INTO THIN WIRES IT IS DUCTILE. METAL IS HARD TO PULL APART IT HAS A HIGH TENSILE STRENGTH OR SMASH IT HAS A HIGH COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH. IF YOU PUSH ON A LONG THIN PIECE OF METAL IT WILL BEND NOT BREAK IT IS ELASTIC. EXCEPT FOR CESIUM COPPER AND GOLD METALS HAVE A NEUTRAL SILVERY COLOR.
NOT ALL METALS HAVE THESE PROPERTIES. MERCURY FOR INSTANCE IS LIQUID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE LEAD IS VERY SOFT AND HEAT AND ELECTRICITY DO NOT PASS THROUGH IRON AS WELL AS THEY DO THROUGH COPPER.
METALS ARE VERY USEFUL TO PEOPLE. THEY ARE USED TO MAKE TOOLS BECAUSE THEY CAN BE STRONG AND EASY TO SHAPE. IRON AND STEEL HAVE BEEN USED TO MAKE BRIDGES BUILDINGS OR SHIPS. 
SOME METALS ARE USED TO MAKE ITEMS LIKE COINS BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD AND WILL NOT WEAR AWAY QUICKLY. FOR EXAMPLE COPPER WHICH IS SHINY AND RED IN COLOR ALUMINIUM WHICH IS SHINY AND WHITE GOLD WHICH IS YELLOW AND SHINY AND SILVER AND NICKEL ALSO WHITE AND SHINY. 
SOME METALS LIKE STEEL CAN BE MADE SHARP AND STAY SHARP SO THEY CAN BE USED TO MAKE KNIVES AXES OR RAZORS.
RARE METALS WITH HIGH VALUE LIKE GOLD SILVER AND PLATINUM ARE OFTEN USED TO MAKE JEWELLERY. METALS ARE ALSO USED TO MAKE FASTENERS AND SCREWS. POTS USED FOR COOKING CAN BE MADE FROM COPPER ALUMINIUM STEEL OR IRON. LEAD IS VERY HEAVY AND DENSE AND CAN BE USED AS BALLAST IN BOATS TO STOP THEM FROM TURNING OVER OR TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM IONIZING RADIATION.
MANY THINGS THAT ARE MADE OF METALS MAY IN FACT BE MADE OF MIXTURES OF AT LEAST ONE METAL WITH EITHER OTHER METALS OR WITH NON METALS. THESE MIXTURES ARE CALLED ALLOYS. SOME COMMON ALLOYS ARE 
PEOPLE FIRST BEGAN MAKING THINGS FROM METAL OVER 9000 YEARS AGO WHEN THEY DISCOVERED HOW TO GET COPPER FROM ITS ORE. THEY THEN LEARNED HOW TO MAKE A HARDER ALLOY BRONZE BY ADDING TIN TO THE COPPER. ABOUT 3000 YEARS AGO THEY DISCOVERED IRON. BY ADDING SMALL AMOUNTS OF CARBON TO IRON THEY FOUND THAT THEY COULD MAKE A PARTICULARLY USEFUL ALLOY STEEL.
IN CHEMISTRY METAL IS A WORD FOR A GROUP OF CHEMICAL ELEMENTS THAT HAVE CERTAIN PROPERTIES. IT IS EASY FOR THE ATOMS OF A METAL TO LOSE AN ELECTRON AND BECOME POSITIVE IONS OR CATIONS. IN THIS WAY METALS ARE NOT LIKE THE OTHER TWO KINDS OF ELEMENTS THE NONMETALS AND THE METALLOIDS. MOST ELEMENTS ON THE PERIODIC TABLE ARE METALS. 
ON THE PERIODIC TABLE WE CAN DRAW A ZIGZAG LINE FROM THE ELEMENT BORON SYMBOL B TO THE ELEMENT POLONIUM SYMBOL PO. THE ELEMENTS THAT THIS LINE PASSES THROUGH ARE THE METALLOIDS. THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE ABOVE AND TO THE RIGHT OF THIS LINE ARE THE NONMETALS. THE REST OF THE ELEMENTS ARE THE METALS.
MOST OF THE PROPERTIES OF METALS ARE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ATOMS IN THE METAL DO NOT HOLD ONTO THEIR ELECTRONS VERY TIGHTLY. EACH ATOM IS SEPARATED FROM THE OTHERS BY A THIN LAYER OF VALENCE ELECTRONS. 
HOWEVER SOME METALS ARE DIFFERENT. AN EXAMPLE IS THE METAL SODIUM. IT IS SOFT MELTS AT A LOW TEMPERATURE AND IS SO LIGHT IT FLOATS ON WATER. PEOPLE SHOULD NOT TRY THIS THOUGH BECAUSE ANOTHER PROPERTY OF SODIUM IS THAT IT EXPLODES WHEN IT TOUCHES WATER. 
MOST METALS ARE CHEMICALLY STABLE AND DO NOT REACT EASILY BUT SOME DO REACT. THE REACTIVE ONES ARE THE ALKALI METALS LIKE SODIUM SYMBOL NA AND THE ALKALINE EARTH METALS LIKE CALCIUM SYMBOL CA. WHEN METALS DO REACT THEY OFTEN REACT WITH OXYGEN. THE OXIDES OF METALS ARE BASIC. THE OXIDES OF NONMETALS ARE ACIDIC.
COMPOUNDS WHICH HAVE METAL ATOMS COMBINED WITH OTHER ATOMS TO MAKE MOLECULES ARE PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON SUBSTANCES ON EARTH. FOR EXAMPLE COMMON SALT IS A COMPOUND OF SODIUM.
THE USE OF METALS IS SAID TO BE THE THING THAT MAKES PEOPLE DIFFERENT FROM ANIMALS. BEFORE THEY USED METALS PEOPLE MADE TOOLS FROM STONES WOOD AND ANIMAL BONES. THIS IS NOW CALLED THE STONE AGE. 
NO ONE KNOWS WHEN THE FIRST METAL WAS FOUND AND USED. IT WAS PROBABLY WHAT IS CALLED NATIVE COPPER WHICH IS SOMETIMES FOUND IN LARGE LUMPS ON THE GROUND. PEOPLE LEARNED TO MAKE THIS INTO COPPER TOOLS AND OTHER THINGS ALTHOUGH FOR A METAL IT IS QUITE SOFT. THEY LEARNED SMELTING TO GET COPPER FROM COMMON ORES. WHEN COPPER WAS MELTED OVER FIRE PEOPLE LEARNED HOW TO MAKE AN ALLOY CALLED BRONZE WHICH IS MUCH HARDER AND STRONGER THAN COPPER. PEOPLE MADE KNIVES AND WEAPONS FROM BRONZE. THIS TIME IN HUMAN HISTORY AFTER ABOUT 3300 BC IS OFTEN CALLED THE BRONZE AGE THAT IS THE TIME OF BRONZE TOOLS AND WEAPONS. 
AROUND THE YEAR 1200 BC SOME PEOPLE LEARNED TO MAKE IRON TOOLS AND WEAPONS. THESE WERE EVEN HARDER AND STRONGER THAN BRONZE AND THIS WAS AN ADVANTAGE IN WAR. THE TIME OF IRON TOOLS AND WEAPONS IS NOW CALLED THE IRON AGE
METALS HAVE BEEN VERY IMPORTANT IN HUMAN HISTORY AND CIVILIZATION. IRON AND STEEL WERE IMPORTANT IN THE MAKING OF MACHINES. GOLD AND SILVER WERE USED AS MONEY IN ORDER TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO TRADE THAT IS EXCHANGE GOODS AND SERVICES OVER LONG DISTANCES.
IN ASTRONOMY A METAL IS ANY ELEMENT OTHER THAN HYDROGEN OR HELIUM. THIS IS BECAUSE THESE TWO ELEMENTS AND SOMETIMES LITHIUM ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT FORM OUTSIDE STARS. IN THE SKY A SPECTROMETER CAN SEE THE SIGNS OF METALS AND SHOW THE ASTRONOMER THE METALS IN A STAR.
METAMORPHOSIS
METAMORPHOSIS IN BIOLOGY MEANS THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION FROM AN IMMATURE FORM TO AN ADULT FORM IN TWO OR MORE DISTINCT STAGES. GOOD EXAMPLES ARE INSECTS AND AMPHIBIANS. LIFE FOR MOST INSECTS BEGINS AS A LARVA OR NYMPH THEN PROGRESSES TO THE PUPA STAGE AND ENDS AS AN ADULT.
THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES OF METAMORPHOSIS IN INSECTS 
SIMPLE METAMORPHOSIS OR HEMIMETABOLISM AND COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS OR HOLOMETABOLISM.
INSECTS WHO GO THROUGH SIMPLE OR INCOMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS HAVE THREE LIFE STAGES. THESE INSECTS START AS EGGS WHICH ARE USUALLY VERY SMALL. WHEN THE EGG HATCHES A LARVA OR NYMPH COMES OUT. NYMPHS ARE JUST BABY INSECTS. MOST OF THE TIME THE NYMPH LOOKS SIMILAR TO THE ADULT BUT IT IS SMALLER MAY HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURATION AND DOES NOT HAVE WINGS. THE NYMPH GROWS THROUGH STAGES CALLED INSTARS SHEDDING ITS SKIN EPICUTICLE AT EACH STAGE ECDYSIS. FINALLY IT CHANGES INTO A MATURE ADULT WITH WINGS.
SOME INSECT NYMPHS ARE AQUATIC WHICH MEANS THEY LIVE IN WATER. THESE NYMPHS USUALLY HAVE GILLS AND LOOK VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ADULTS THEY WILL TURN INTO. NYMPHS THAT LIVE IN WATER ARE CALLED NAIADS.
SOME INSECTS THAT HAVE A LIFE CYCLE OF EGG NYMPH ADULT ARE 
INSECTS THAT HAVE COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS HAVE FOUR LIFE STAGES. THESE INSECTS START AS EGGS WHICH ARE VERY SMALL. THE EGG HATCHES AND A LARVA COMES OUT. THE LARVA LOOKS LIKE A WORM AND EATS AND EATS SO THAT IT CAN GROW MUCH BIGGER. WHEN THE LARVA HAS GROWN IT CHANGES INTO A PUPA. THE PUPA USUALLY CAN NOT MOVE OR EAT. THE PUPA IS A SPECIAL TIME WHEN THE INSECT IS CHANGING INTO AN ADULT THAT WILL LOOK VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE LARVA OR THE PUPA. MOTH PUPAE PLURAL OF PUPA ARE INSIDE COCOONS. WHEN THE PUPA OPENS THE ADULT INSECT COMES OUT.
MANY INSECTS HAVE A LIFE CYCLE OF EGG LARVA PUPA ADULT. SOME OF THESE INSECTS ARE 
THE MONARCH BUTTERFLY GOES THROUGH FOUR STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. LIFE FOR A MONARCH BUTTERFLY BEGINS AS AN EGG HATCHED FROM AN ADULT. THIS EGG THEN DEVELOPS INTO A WORM LIKE LARVA CATERPILLAR. IN THE PUPA OR CHRYSALIS STAGE THE CATERPILLAR SPINS A SILK PAD ON A TWIG OR LEAVES AND HANGS FROM THIS PAD BY ITS LAST PAIR OF PROLEGS. IT HANGS UPSIDE DOWN IN THE SHAPE OF A J AND THEN MOLTS LEAVING IT ENCASED IN A GREEN EXOSKELETON. THE MATURE BUTTERFLY EMERGES AFTER ABOUT TWO WEEKS AND FEEDS ON A VARIETY OF FLOWERS INCLUDING MILKWEED FLOWERS RED CLOVER AND GOLDENROD.
IN TYPICAL AMPHIBIAN DEVELOPMENT EGGS ARE LAID IN WATER AND LARVAE ARE ADAPTED TO AN AQUATIC LIFESTYLE. FROGS TOADS AND NEWTS ALL HATCH FROM THE EGG AS LARVAE WITH EXTERNAL GILLS. AFTERWARDS NEWT LARVAE START A PREDATORY LIFESTYLE WHILE TADPOLES MOSTLY SCRAPE FOOD OFF SURFACES WITH THEIR HORNY TOOTH RIDGES.
MANY MARINE SPECIES HAVE EVOLVED A SYSTEM WHERE THEY RELEASE THEIR EGGS AND SPERM INTO THE WATER AT THE SAME TIME AND FERTILISATION TAKES PLACE IN THE SEA OVER ONE OR TWO DAYS. THIS INCREASES THEIR CHANCE OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS.
THEN LARVAE JOIN THE OTHER PLANKTON EATING AND GROWING BEFORE METAMORPHOSING INTO ADULTS. MOST MARINE INVERTEBRATES AND MANY FISH HAVE A LIFE CYCLE WITH PELAGIC LARVAE OR EVEN PELAGIC EGGS. THESE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE TRANSPORTED LONG DISTANCES AND SO SPREAD THE SPECIES AROUND TO OTHER PLACES.
THE NEED FOR METAMORPHOSIS IS CLEAR WHEN THE RELATIVE SIZE OF EGGS AND ADULTS IS UNDERSTOOD. A MATURE ATLANTIC COD CAN REACH TWO METRES LONG AND WEIGH OVER 200 POUNDS 96 KG. THE FEMALE WILL PRODUCE OVER 100 000 EGGS IN A SINGLE SPAWNING AND THE RESULTING LARVAE ARE QUITE TINY. THERE IS NO WAY THEY COULD LIVE LIKE THE ADULTS WHICH ARE MORE OR LESS TOP PREDATORS. THE LARVAE CANNOT EVEN SWIM AGAINST THE CURRENT. THEREFORE THEY MUST LIVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF LIFE BEFORE THEY CAN LIVE AS THE ADULTS DO. 
THEIR DEVELOPMENT IS PACKAGED INTO STAGES AND EACH STAGE HAS ADAPTATIONS TO LIFE AT ITS STAGE. THE SHARP DISTINCTION BETWEEN STAGES BEST SEEN IN INSECTS IS PRESUMABLY BECAUSE A LONGER TRANSITION WOULD LEAVE THE JUVENILE LESS FIT EITHER AT ITS YOUNGER OR OLDER WAYS OF LIFE.
METAPHOR
METAPHOR IS A TERM FOR A FIGURE OF SPEECH. IT DOES NOT USE A WORD IN ITS BASIC LITERAL SENSE. INSTEAD IT USES A WORD IN A KIND OF COMPARISON. WE RUN AND WE ALSO SAY RIVERS RUN. WE MAY RUN INTO TROUBLE ESPECIALLY IF WE RUN UP A BILL AT THE BAR. 
SO A METAPHOR USES WORDS TO MAKE A PICTURE IN OUR MIND. IT TAKES A WORD FROM ITS ORIGINAL CONTEXT AND USES IT IN ANOTHER.
METAPHORS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF LANGUAGE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SPEAK OR WRITE WITHOUT THEM. A SIMPLE EXAMPLE IS THE WORD RUN. THIS HAS A BASIC MEANING OF MOVING QUICKLY OR GO WITH QUICK STEPS ON ALTERNATE FEET NEVER HAVING BOTH FEET ON THE GROUND AT THE SAME TIME. THE CONCISE OXFORD DICTIONARY THEN GIVES 
34 OTHER USES AS A VERB 21 USES AS A NOUN ABOUT 50 USES IN SHORT PHRASES. ALL OF THESE ARE METAPHORS ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT USUALLY NOTICE THIS. 
WE USE METAPHORS TO MAKE INDIRECT COMPARISONS BUT WITHOUT USING LIKE OR AS BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A SIMILE. A SIMILE IS A DIRECT COMPARISON JANE IS LIKE A CHILD.
A METAPHOR VERY OFTEN USES THE VERB TO BE LOVE IS WAR FOR EXAMPLE NOT LOVE IS LIKE WAR THAT IS A SIMILE.
POETRY INCLUDES MUCH METAPHOR USUALLY MORE THAN PROSE.
SPAM IS AN EXAMPLE THAT ANY EMAIL USER KNOWS ABOUT THIS WORD WAS ORIGINALLY A METAPHOR FROM SPAM A TYPE OF CANNED MEAT. SERVERS PUTTING UNWANTED EMAIL INTO SOMEBODY S INBOX WAS SIMILAR TO WAITERS PUTTING UNWANTED SPAM INTO FOOD. THIS WAS ORIGINALLY SUGGESTED BY A MONTY PYTHON SCENE. WHEN WE USE A METAPHOR VERY OFTEN AND WE FORGET THE OLD MEANING OR FORGET THAT THE TWO MEANINGS ARE CONNECTED THIS IS A DEAD METAPHOR.
ORIGINALLY METAPHOR WAS A GREEK WORD FOR TRANSFER. IT CAME FROM META BEYOND AND PHEREIN CARRY. SO THE WORD METAPHOR IN ENGLISH WAS A METAPHOR TOO. TODAY IN GREEK METAPHOR IS A TROLLEY A THING THAT IS PUSHED FOR CARRYING SHOPPING OR BAGS.
A SIMPLE METAPHOR HAS A SINGLE LINK BETWEEN THE SUBJECT AND THE METAPHORIC VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE THUS HAS A SINGLE MEANING WHICH IS TRANSFERRED DIRECTLY TO THE SUBJECT.
IN THE SIMPLE METAPHOR THE EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUTHOR OR SPEAKER INTENDS IS RELATIVELY LOW AND HENCE IT MAY EASILY BE USED WITH A WIDER AND LESS SOPHISTICATED AUDIENCE.
A COMPLEX METAPHOR HAPPENS WHERE A SIMPLE METAPHOR IS BASED ON A SECONDARY METAPHORIC ELEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE USING A METAPHOR OF LIGHT FOR UNDERSTANDING MAY BE COMPLEXIFIED BY SAYING THROWING LIGHT RATHER THAN SHINING LIGHT. THROWING IS AN EXTRA METAPHOR FOR HOW LIGHT ARRIVES. 
A COMPOUND METAPHOR IS ONE WHERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE PARTS IN THE METAPHOR THAT ARE USED TO SNAG THE LISTENER. THESE PARTS MAY BE ENHANCEMENT WORDS SUCH AS ADVERBS ADJECTIVES ETC.
EACH PART IN THE COMPOUND METAPHOR MAY BE USED TO SIGNIFY AN ADDITIONAL ITEM OF MEANING.
COMPOUND METAPHORS ARE LIKE A MULTIPLE PUNCH HITTING THE LISTENER REPEATEDLY WITH METAPHORIC ELEMENTS. WHERE THE COMPLEX METAPHOR USES STACKED LAYERS TO ENHANCE THE METAPHOR THE COMPOUND METAPHOR USES SEQUENTIAL WORDS. THE COMPOUND METAPHOR IS ALSO KNOWN AS A LOOSE METAPHOR.
A LIVE METAPHOR IS ONE WHICH A READER NOTICES. A DEAD METAPHOR IS ONE NO ONE NOTICES BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME SO COMMON IN THE LANGUAGE. 
TWO PEOPLE WALK OFF A TENNIS COURT. SOMEONE ASKS THE LOSER WHAT HAPPENED.
METRIC SYSTEM
THE METRIC SYSTEM IS A SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENT WITH LENGTH BASED ON THE METER MASS OR WEIGHT ON THE GRAM AND CAPACITY VOLUME BASED ON THE LITER. THIS SYSTEM IS USED AROUND THE WORLD. IT WAS DEVELOPED IN FRANCE AND FIRST INTRODUCED THERE IN 1791 2 YEARS AFTER THE BEHEADING OF KING LOUIS XVI. THE METRIC UNITS ARE BASED ON DECIMAL GROUPS MULTIPLES OF TEN. AT FIRST THE METRIC SYSTEM WAS BASED ON TWO QUANTITIES LENGTH AND WEIGHT. THE BASIC UNITS WERE CALLED THE METRE AND THE GRAMME.
IN 1866 THE UNITED STATES STARTED TO USE THE METRIC SYSTEM BUT IT STILL IS NOT THE MAIN US SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENT. BY 1875 MANY COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND IN LATIN AMERICA HAD CHANGED TO USING THE METRIC SYSTEM. IN 1875 SEVENTEEN COUNTRIES SIGNED THE METRE CONVENTION AGREEING TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEFINING AND MANAGING THE METRE AND KILOGRAM STANDARDS. THE PROTOTYPE COPIES OF THE METRE AND OF THE KILOGRAM WERE CALLED THE INTERNATIONAL PROTOTYPE METRE AND INTERNATIONAL PROTOTYPE KILOGRAM. A NEW ORGANIZATION CALLED THE INTERNATIONAL BUREAU OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES BIPM WAS SET UP. THE INTERNATIONAL PROTOTYPE METRE AND KILOGRAM WAS KEPT AT THE BIPM HEADQUARTERS. IN 1960 THE RULES FOR THE METRIC SYSTEM WAS REVISED. THE REVISED SYSTEM WAS CALLED THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS WHICH IS OFTEN WRITTEN SI FOR SHORT. THE DEFINITION OF SI ALSO INCLUDED RULES FOR WRITING SI QUANTITIES. THESE RULES ARE THE SAME FOR ALL LANGUAGES. IN THE 1970S MANY PEOPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE REST OF THE COMMONWEALTH STARTED USING THE METRIC SYSTEM AT THEIR PLACES OF WORK.
THE METRIC SYSTEM IS A DECIMAL BASED SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENT. THE SYSTEM HAS UNITS OF MEASURE FOR EACH QUANTITY. THE NAMES OF MOST UNITS OF MEASURE IN THE METRIC SYSTEM HAVE TWO PARTS. ONE PART IS THE UNIT NAME AND THE OTHER PART IS THE PREFIX. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE NAME CENTIMETRE THE WORD CENTI IS THE PREFIX AND THE WORD METRE IS THE UNIT NAME. SOMETIMES AS WITH METRE LITRE AND GRAM THERE IS NO PREFIX.
IN THE METRIC SYSTEM ALL UNITS HAVE A SYMBOL. SYMBOLS ARE A SHORTHAND WAY OF WRITING THE NAMES OF UNITS. ALL THE COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD USE THE SAME SYMBOL FOR A UNIT EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF WRITING OUT THE UNIT NAME IN FULL. FOR EXAMPLE
THE METRIC SYSTEM WAS FIRST DEVELOPED IN FRANCE DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. A FRENCH LAW PASSED IN 1795 DEFINED FIVE UNITS OF MEASURE. THREE OF THESE NAMES ARE STILL IN USE TODAY. THEY ARE THE METRE WHICH IS THE UNIT OF LENGTH THE GRAM WHICH IS THE UNIT OF MASS AND THE LITRE WHICH IS THE UNIT OF VOLUME. SINCE THEN MANY OTHER UNITS OF MEASURE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND MANY DEFINITIONS CHANGED. THE METRIC SYSTEM NOW HAS UNITS OF MEASUREMENT FOR ENERGY POWER FORCE ELECTRIC CURRENT RADIOACTIVITY AND MANY OTHERS. THE MOST COMMONLY USED UNITS OF MEASURE IN THE METRIC SYSTEM ARE LISTED BELOW.
THE DEFINITIONS OF THE UNITS ARE OFTEN BEING CHANGED. IN 1960 THE DEFINITION OF THE METRE WAS CHANGED. SINCE THEN IT HAS BEEN DEFINED IN TERMS OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT. AT THE CURRENT TIME 2014 IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE KILOGRAM BE REDEFINED IN TERMS OF THE PLANCK CONSTANT.
IF THE NUMBERS ARE TOO BIG OR TOO SMALL THE METRIC SYSTEM USES PREFIXES TO MAKE IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THE NUMBERS. 
MILLI
CENTI
KILO
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER PREFIXES. SOME OF THEM ARE 
THESE TABLES WILL HELP YOU TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF DIFFERENT LENGTHS OR MASSES IN THE METRIC SYSTEM. IN THESE TABLES 
SOME NAMES IN THE METRIC SYSTEM ARE SPELT DIFFERENTLY IN BRITISH ENGLISH AND IN AMERICAN ENGLISH.
IN 1875 REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE GOVERNMENTS OF TWENTY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES MET IN PARIS TO DISCUSS WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. SEVENTEEN OF THE COUNTRIES SIGNED A TREATY ABOUT WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. THE TREATY WAS CALLED THE CONVENTION OF THE METRE. THE COUNTRIES THAT SIGNED WERE ARGENTINE CONFEDERATION AUSTRIA HUNGARY BELGIUM BRAZIL DENMARK FRANCE GERMANY ITALY PERU PORTUGAL RUSSIA SPAIN SWEDEN AND NORWAY SWITZERLAND TURKEY UNITED STATES AND VENEZUELA. THEY AGREED 
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS WENT TO THE CONFERENCE BUT DID NOT SIGN THE TREATY AT THAT TIME. AFTER FURTHER CONSIDERATION THE UNITED KINGDOM DID SIGN THE TREATY IN 1884 AND THE NETHERLANDS BECAME A MEMBER IN 1929.
IN 1889 THE COPIES OF THE KILOGRAM AND THE METRE WERE READY TO BE GIVEN TO THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THAT SIGNED THE TREATY.
THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS RATIFIED THE TREATY IN 1878. THE UNITED KINGDOM SIGNED THE TREATY 1884. NEITHER COUNTRY PASSED LAWS MAKING IT COMPULSORY TO USE THE METRIC SYSTEM.
IN 1921 THE METRE CONVENTION WAS EXTENDED TO INCLUDE ALL PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS INCLUDING TIME ELECTRICITY AND TEMPERATURE.
IN 1960 THE BIPM PUBLISHED THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS OR SI. SI CLARIFIED A NUMBER OF AREAS OF THE METRIC SYSTEM PARTICULARLY IN SCIENCE AND IN ENGINEERING. THE BIPM ALSO STANDARDIZED THE WAY IN WHICH SI WAS WRITTEN MAKING IT THE SAME FOR ALL LANGUAGES.
THERE ARE 16 US FLUID OUNCES IN A US PINT BUT THERE ARE 20 IMPERIAL UK FLUID OUNCES IN AN IMPERIAL PINT. THE US FLUID OUNCE IS LARGER THAN THE IMPERIAL FLUID OUNCE BUT THE IMPERIAL PINT IS LARGER THAN THE US PINT. IN THE 1700 S THIS TYPE SITUATION WAS COMMON ACROSS EUROPE. EACH COUNTRY MEASURED LENGTH WEIGHT MASS AND VOLUME IN ITS OWN WAY. SOMETIMES DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OR CITIES USED THE SAME NAME FOR DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS. SOMETIMES DIFFERENT CITIES IN THE SAME COUNTRY HAD DIFFERENT WAYS OF MEASURING THINGS. IN 1789 THERE WERE A QUARTER OF A MILLION DIFFERENT UNITS OF WEIGHT AND MEASURE IN FRANCE.
DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION THE FRENCH SCIENTISTS DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE A NEW SYSTEM OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURE. THE SYSTEM WOULD BE THE SAME IN ALL FRENCH PROVINCES AND CITIES. THEY ALSO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD EASIER IF THE NEW SYSTEM USED 10 S INSTEAD OF 12 S 16 S OR 20 S. THIS IS BECAUSE PEOPLE NORMALLY COUNT IN 10 S. THE NEW SYSTEM BECAME THE OFFICIAL SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENT IN FRANCE IN 1799. ONE OF THE FRENCH LEADERS THE MARQUIS DE CONDORCET DECLARED THAT THE METRIC SYSTEM IS FOR ALL PEOPLE FOR ALL TIME.
THEY DECIDED THAT THE NEW SYSTEM WOULD BE FOR EVERYBODY ON EARTH AND THAT THE NEW UNIT OF LENGTH WOULD BE CALLED A METRE. THEY DECIDED TO THERE WOULD BE 10 000 000 METRES BETWEEN THE NORTH POLE AND THE EQUATOR. BETWEEN 1791 AND 1798 TWO SURVEYORS PIERRE M CHAIN AND JEAN BAPTISTE DELAMBRE MEASURED THE DISTANCE FROM DUNKIRK TO BARCELONA USING OLD FRENCH UNITS. THEY USED THE STARS TO MEASURE THE LATITUDE OF THESE CITIES. THEY USED THIS INFORMATION TO WORK OUT THAT THE LENGTH OF THE METRE SHOULD 443.296 LIGNES. IN 1798 THE FRENCH SCIENTISTS MADE A BAR OF PLATINUM THAT WAS EXACTLY ONE METRE LONG. THEY STORED THIS BAR IN THE FRENCH ARCHIVES. IT WAS CALLED THE METRE DES ARCHIVES. PEOPLE WHO MADE ONE METRE RULERS WERE ABLE TO CHECK THAT THEIR RULERS WERE THE SAME LENGTH AS THE METRE DES ARCHIVES. OTHER SCIENTISTS MADE A KILOGRAM WEIGHT FROM PLATINUM WHICH WAS ALSO PUT IN THE ARCHIVES. THIS WEIGHT WAS CALLED THE KILOGRAM DES ARCHIVES.
IN 1799 THE METRIC SYSTEM WAS MADE COMPULSORY MEANING PEOPLE WERE MADE TO USE IT BY LAW IN THE REGION AROUND PARIS. THIS CAUSED A LOT OF CONFUSION BECAUSE THE POLICE ENFORCED THE NEW MEASURES BUT CUSTOMERS PREFERRED THE OLD ONES. SO SHOPKEEPERS HAD TO HAVE BOTH. PEOPLE BECAME WORRIED THE NEW MEASURES WERE USED TO CHEAT THEM. POLITICIANS TRIED TO EDUCATE AND CONVINCE PEOPLE TO USE METRIC BUT THE PEOPLE REJECTED THE METRIC SYSTEM. IN 1800 THE GOVERNMENT TRIED TO MAKE THE SYSTEM ACCEPTABLE BY CHANGING THE NAMES OF THE UNITS BACK TO THE SIMPLER NAMES USED BEFORE METRICATION. FOR EXAMPLE THE DECIMETRE CENTIMETRE AND MILLIMETRE WERE RENAMED TO PALME HAND DOIGT FINGER AND TRAIT TRACE.
IN 1799 NAPOLEON BECAME THE LEADER OF FRANCE. BY 1812 HE HAD CONQUERED MOST OF EUROPE. HE INTRODUCED THE METRIC SYSTEM TO THE COUNTRIES THAT HE CONQUERED. IN 1815 HE WAS DEFEATED AT THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO. AFTER NAPOLEON WAS DEFEATED MOST OF THE COUNTRIES STARTED USING THEIR OLD SYSTEMS OF MEASUREMENT AGAIN.
DURING THIS TIME THE METRIC SYSTEM WAS STILL THE OFFICIAL SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENT IN FRANCE. AND IT STILL HAD SIMPLIFIED UNIT NAMES. BUT THE FRENCH PEOPLE CONTINUED TO USE THE MEASURES THEY WERE USED TO. THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT TRIED TO PERSUADE THE PEOPLE TO CONVERT. THEY MASS PRODUCED METRIC RULERS THEY TRIED TO TEACH THE PEOPLE TO USE METRIC MEASURES AND COMMANDED THE POLICE TO PUNISH PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT COOPERATE. EVENTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT STOPPED TRYING AND WITHDREW THE METRIC SYSTEM.
ON 12 FEBRUARY 1812 FRANCE STOPPED USING THE METRIC SYSTEM AND STARTED USING A NEW SYSTEM CALLED MESURES USUELLES. THE NEW SYSTEM WAS BASED ON MANY OF THE OLD PRE METRIC UNITS. THE OLD UNITS WERE REDEFINED TO BE ROUND NUMBERS OR FRACTIONS OF THE WITHDRAWN METRIC UNITS. FOR EXAMPLE THE LIVRE POUND WAS REINTRODUCED AND CHANGED FROM 489 GRAMS TO 500 GRAMS. THE TOISE WAS REDEFINED AS 2 METRES. THE TOISE CONTAINED 6 PIED FEET CHANGED FROM 324.8 MM TO OF A METRE 333.33 MM. THE PIED HAD 12 POUCES INCHES AND THE POUCE HAD 12 LIGNES.
IN 1837 THE METRICATION LAWS WERE REVIVED IN FRANCE. AND IN 1840 THE SYSTEM DID BECOME COMPULSORY THROUGHOUT FRANCE ALMOST 50 YEARS AFTER IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED.
DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY MANY SMALL COUNTRIES STARTED COOPERATING WITH EACH OTHER. IN 1815 THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS WAS FORMED FROM SEVENTEEN SMALL STATES. EACH STATE HAD ITS OWN SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENT. IN 1820 THEY DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF EVERYBODY USED THE METRIC SYSTEM.
IN 1815 THE GERMAN CONFEDERATION WAS FORMED. IT WAS AN ASSOCIATION OF 39 DIFFERENT STATES. EACH STATE HAD ITS OWN SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENTS. IN 1834 THE GERMAN CONFEDERATION FORMED A CUSTOMS UNION CALLED THE ZOLLVEREIN. IN 1851 THE ZOLLVEREIN DECIDED TO USE METRIC UNITS FOR TRADE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS STATES. IN 1871 MOST OF THE STATES IN THE GERMAN CONFEDERATION WERE JOINED TOGETHER TO FORM THE GERMAN EMPIRE. THE GERMAN EMPIRE CONTINUED TO USE THE METRIC SYSTEM. 
IN THE SAME YEAR ITALY WAS ALSO FORMED FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL STATES. ITALY ALSO DECIDED TO USE THE METRIC SYSTEM RATHER THAN CHOOSING ONE OF THE OLD SYSTEMS OF MEASUREMENT.
BY 1875 MANY EUROPEAN AND LATIN AMERICAN COUNTIES WERE ALREADY USING THE METRIC SYSTEM. THESE COUNTRIES INCLUDED FRANCE GERMANY ITALY SPAIN PORTUGAL BRAZIL MEXICO ARGENTINA PERU AND COLUMBIA. BETWEEN 1875 AND 1914 MANY MORE COUNTRIES INCLUDING NORWAY SWEDEN DENMARK FINLAND PARAGUAY PHILIPPINES AND VIETNAM STARTED TO USE THE METRIC SYSTEM. IN 1917 DURING THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION THE USSR NOW RUSSIA ADOPTED THE METRIC SYSTEM. BY THE START OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR MOST NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES HAD ADOPTED THE METRIC SYSTEM.
IN 1866 AFTER MOST OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES STARTED TO USE THE METRIC SYSTEM THE UNITED STATES PASSED A LAW THAT ALLOWED PEOPLE TO USE EITHER THE METRIC SYSTEM OR UNITED STATES CUSTOMARY UNITS FOR TRADE. BEFORE 1893 THE YARD WAS DEFINED AS THE LENGTH OF THE STANDARD YARD WHICH WAS KEPT BY THE UNITED STATES TREASURY. THE POUND WAS DEFINED AS BEING THE MASS OF THE STANDARD POUND. IN 1893 THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS PASSED THE MENDENHALL ORDER. THIS ORDER DEFINED THE YARD AS BEING EXACTLY METRES AND THE POUND AS BEING EXACTLY 0.4535924277 KILOGRAM. THE ORDER ONLY CHANGED THE DEFINITIONS OF THE POUND AND THE YARD. IT HAD NO OTHER EFFECT ON PEOPLE S LIVES.
IN 1975 THE METRIC CONVERSION ACT STARTED A FORMAL METRICATION PROCESS. METRICATION WAS TO BE VOLUNTARY. IT WAS TO BE COORDINATED BY THE U.S. METRIC BOARD. IN 1988 THE OMNIBUS TRADE AND COMPETITIVENESS ACT SAID THAT METRIC UNITS HAD TO BE USED FOR ALL FEDERAL PROJECTS. THE ACT DID NOT APPLY TO STATE PROJECTS. SOME STATES DEMANDED THAT METRIC UNITS BE USED BUT OTHER STATES DID NOT. SOME INDUSTRIES CHANGED TO USING METRIC UNITS BUT OTHERS DID NOT. SOFT DRINKS ARE SOLD IN METRIC QUANTITIES. MILK IS SOLD IN CUSTOMARY UNITS. METRIC UNITS ARE WIDELY USED IN THE DESIGN OF MOTOR CARS. AIRCRAFT SUCH AS THE BOEING 787 DREAMLINER WERE DESIGNED USING MAINLY CUSTOMARY UNITS.
SOME PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES WANT TO COMPLETE THE CHANGE OVER TO THE METRIC SYSTEM. THEY SAY THAT IT WILL MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR EVERYBODY. OTHER PEOPLE SAY THAT IT WILL COST TOO MUCH MONEY.
SOME PEOPLE WANT TO USE THE METRIC SYSTEM BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO EXPORT GOODS. OTHER PEOPLE SAY THAT METRICATION CAN ONLY WORK IF ALL FIFTY STATES METRICATE AT THE SAME TIME. THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN UNLESS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKES THE LEAD.
IN 1897 THE UNITED KINGDOM PASSED A LAW ALLOWING PEOPLE TO USE EITHER THE METRIC SYSTEM OR IMPERIAL UNITS FOR TRADE. BY THE LATE 1960S THREE QUARTERS OF BRITISH EXPORTS WERE TO COUNTRIES THAT USED THE METRIC SYSTEM. HOWEVER PEOPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM STILL USED IMPERIAL UNITS. THE METRICATION BOARD WAS SET UP IN 1969 TO HELP BRITAIN CHANGE TO THE METRIC SYSTEM. EACH COMPANY HAD TO PAY THEIR OWN EXPENSES. SOME COMPANIES SAVED A LOT OF MONEY BY CHANGING TO THE METRIC SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY COULD MAKE THE SAME GOODS FOR EXPORT AS THEY MADE FOR SALES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. FOR EXAMPLE ALMOST ALL MOTOR CARS USE METRIC SIZED NUTS AND BOLTS. OTHER COMPANIES LOST MONEY BECAUSE THEY HAD TO MAKE MANY CHANGES BUT DID NOT HAVE ANY BENEFIT FROM THE CHANGES. 
WHEN THE METRICATION BOARD WAS CLOSED DOWN IN 1981 MOST OF GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY HAD CHANGED TO THE METRIC SYSTEM BUT A LOT OF EVERYDAY THINGS LIKE ROAD SIGNS HAD NOT BEEN CHANGED. A SURVEY TAKEN IN 2013 SHOWED THAT METRIC UNITS AND IMPERIAL UNITS WERE BOTH WIDELY USED BY BRITISH PEOPLE IN THEIR PRIVATE LIVES.
MINERAL
MINERALS ARE SUBSTANCES THAT ARE FORMED NATURALLY IN THE EARTH. 
MINERALS ARE USUALLY SOLID INORGANIC HAVE A CRYSTAL STRUCTURE AND FORM NATURALLY BY GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES. 
THE STUDY OF MINERALS IS CALLED MINERALOGY.
A MINERAL CAN BE MADE OF SINGLE CHEMICAL ELEMENT OR MORE USUALLY A COMPOUND. THERE ARE OVER 4 000 TYPES OF KNOWN MINERALS. TWO COMMON MINERALS ARE QUARTZ AND FELDSPAR.
A MINERAL IS A SUBSTANCE THAT USUALLY
ONE RECENT DEFINITION IS 
ALTERNATIVELY A MINERAL IS ONE LISTED AS SUCH BY THE INTERNATIONAL MINERALOGICAL ASSOCIATION.
MINERALS ARE DIFFERENT FROM ROCKS. A MINERAL IS A CHEMICAL COMPOUND WITH A GIVEN COMPOSITION AND A DEFINED CRYSTAL STRUCTURE. A ROCK IS A MIXTURE OF ONE OR SEVERAL MINERALS IN VARYING PROPORTIONS.
A ROCK HAS ONLY TWO OF THE CHARACTERISTICS MINERALS HAVE IT IS A SOLID AND IT FORMS NATURALLY. A ROCK USUALLY CONTAINS TWO OR MORE TYPES OF MINERALS. TWO SAMPLES OF THE SAME TYPE OF ROCK MAY HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MINERALS IN THEM. MINERALS ARE ALWAYS MADE UP OF THE SAME MATERIALS IN NEARLY THE SAME PROPORTIONS. A RUBY IS A MINERAL. THEREFORE A RUBY FOUND IN INDIA HAS SIMILAR MAKEUP AS A RUBY FOUND IN AUSTRALIA.
MINERALS ARE FORMED BY NATURAL PROCESSES. A FEW SUBSTANCES WITH THE SAME CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AS MINERALS CAN BE PRODUCED BY LIVING CREATURES AS PART OF THEIR SHELLS OR BONES. THE SHELLS OF MOLLUSCS ARE COMPOSED OF EITHER CALCITE OR ARAGONITE OR BOTH.
TRADITIONALLY CHEMICALS PRODUCED BY LIVING THINGS ARE NOT CONSIDERED MINERALS. HOWEVER IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHY AN ORGANIC SUBSTANCE SHOULD NOT BE CALLED A MINERAL IF ITS CHEMICAL NATURE AND ITS CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE IS IDENTICAL WITH ITS INORGANIC TWIN. THIS ISSUE IS NOW UNDER DEBATE SEE RAILSBACK PART II.
MINERALS FORM IN MANY WAYS. THE MINERAL HALITE WHICH IS USED AS TABLE SALT FORMS WHEN WATER EVAPORATES IN A HOT SHALLOW PART OF THE OCEAN LEAVING BEHIND THE SALT IT CONTAINED. MANY TYPES OF MINERALS ARE MADE WHEN MOLTEN ROCK OR MAGMA COOLS AND TURNS INTO A SOLID. TALC A MINERAL THAT CAN BE USED TO MAKE BABY POWDER FORMS DEEP IN EARTH AS HIGH PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE CAUSES CHANGES IN SOLID ROCK.
THE EXTRAORDINARY THING IS THAT MOST MINERALS OWE THEIR FORMATION TO LIFE OR AT LEAST TO THE GREAT OXYGENATION EVENT. STURDY MINERALS RATHER THAN FRAGILE ORGANIC REMAINS MAY PROVIDE THE MOST ROBUST AND LASTING SIGNS OF BIOLOGY.
A MINERAL IS A SOLID THAT IS IT HAS A DEFINITE VOLUME AND A ROUGH SHAPE. VOLUME REFERS TO THE AMOUNT OF SPACE AN OBJECT TAKES UP. FOR EXAMPLE A GOLF BALL HAS A SMALLER VOLUME THAN A BASEBALL AND A BASEBALL HAS A SMALLER VOLUME THAN A BASKETBALL.
A SUBSTANCE THAT IS A LIQUID OR A GAS IS NOT A MINERAL. HOWEVER IN SOME CASES ITS SOLID FORM IS A MINERAL. FOR INSTANCE LIQUID WATER IS NOT A MINERAL BUT ICE IS.
THESE PROPERTIES ARE USED MOST OFTEN 
THE PARTICLES OF ICE THAT MAKE UP FROST HAVE SMOOTH FLAT SURFACES. THESE FLAT SURFACES FORM BECAUSE OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF ATOMS IN THE ICE WHICH IS A MINERAL. SUCH AN INTERNAL ARRANGEMENT IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF MINERALS. IT IS THE STRUCTURE OF A CRYSTAL A SOLID IN WHICH THE ATOMS ARE ARRANGED IN AN ORDERLY REPEATING THREE DIMENSIONAL PATTERN. 
EACH MINERAL HAS ITS OWN TYPE OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURE. IN SOME CASES TWO MINERALS HAVE THE SAME CHEMICAL COMPOSITION BUT DIFFERENT CRYSTAL STRUCTURES. FOR EXAMPLE BOTH DIAMOND AND GRAPHITE CONSIST OF JUST ONE ELEMENT CARBON. BUT THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE CARBON ATOMS IN THESE TWO MINERALS ARE NOT THE SAME SO THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CRYSTAL STRUCTURES AND VERY DIFFERENT PROPERTIES. DIAMONDS ARE EXTREMELY HARD AND HAVE A BRILLIANT SPARKLE. GRAPHITE IS SOFT GRAY AND DULL. 
IN NATURE A PERFECT CRYSTAL IS RARE. MOST CRYSTALS HAVE IMPERFECT SHAPES BECAUSE THEIR GROWTH WAS LIMITED BY OTHER CRYSTALS FORMING NEXT TO THEM.
EACH MINERAL HAS A DEFINITE CHEMICAL MAKEUP IT CONSISTS OF A SPECIFIC COMBINATION OF ATOMS OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS. AN ELEMENT IS A SUBSTANCE THAT CONTAINS ONLY ONE TYPE OF ATOM.
SCIENTISTS CAN CLASSIFY MINERALS INTO GROUPS ON THE BASIS OF THEIR CHEMICAL MAKEUP. THOUGH THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT MINERALS ONLY ABOUT 30 ARE COMMON IN EARTH S CRUST. THESE 30 MINERALS MAKE UP MOST ROCKS IN THE CRUST. FOR THAT REASON THEY ARE CALLED ROCK FORMING MINERALS. 
THERE ARE MANY OTHER MINERAL GROUPS.
PEOPLE USE MINERALS FOR MANY EVERYDAY PURPOSES. EVERY TIME PEOPLE TURN ON A MICROWAVE OVEN OR A TV MINERALS ARE BEING USED. THE COPPER IN THE WIRES THAT CARRY ELECTRICITY TO THE MACHINE IS MADE FROM A MINERAL. TABLE SALT OR HALITE IS ANOTHER MINERAL THAT PEOPLE USE IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE. 
MOBILE PHONE
A MOBILE PHONE ALSO KNOWN AS A WIRELESS PHONE CELL PHONE OR CELLULAR TELEPHONE IS A SMALL PORTABLE RADIO TELEPHONE.
THE MOBILE PHONE CAN BE USED TO COMMUNICATE OVER LONG DISTANCES WITHOUT WIRES. IT WORKS BY COMMUNICATING WITH A NEARBY BASE STATION ALSO CALLED A CELL SITE WHICH CONNECTS IT TO THE MAIN PHONE NETWORK. WHEN MOVING IF THE MOBILE PHONE GETS TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE CELL IT IS CONNECTED TO THAT CELL SENDS A MESSAGE TO ANOTHER CELL TO TELL THE NEW CELL TO TAKE OVER THE CALL. THIS IS CALLED A HAND OFF AND THE CALL CONTINUES WITH THE NEW CELL THE PHONE IS CONNECTED TO. THE HAND OFF IS DONE SO WELL AND CAREFULLY THAT THE USER WILL USUALLY NEVER EVEN KNOW THAT THE CALL WAS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER CELL.
AS MOBILE PHONES BECAME MORE POPULAR THEY BEGAN TO COST LESS MONEY AND MORE PEOPLE COULD AFFORD THEM. MONTHLY PLANS BECAME AVAILABLE FOR RATES AS LOW AS US 30 OR US 40 A MONTH. CELL PHONES HAVE BECOME SO CHEAP TO OWN THAT THEY HAVE MOSTLY REPLACED PAY PHONES AND PHONE BOOTHS EXCEPT FOR URBAN AREAS WITH MANY PEOPLE.
IN THE 21ST CENTURY A NEW TYPE OF MOBILE PHONE CALLED SMARTPHONES HAVE BECOME POPULAR. NOW MORE PEOPLE ARE USING SMARTPHONES THAN THE OLD KIND OF MOBILE PHONE WHICH ARE CALLED FEATURE PHONES.
MOBILE PHONES IN THE 1950S THROUGH 1970S WERE LARGE AND HEAVY AND MOST WERE BUILT INTO CARS. IN THE LATE 20TH CENTURY TECHNOLOGY IMPROVED SO PEOPLE COULD CARRY THEIR PHONES EASILY.
ALTHOUGH DR. MARTIN COOPER FROM MOTOROLA MADE THE FIRST CALL USING A MOBILE PHONE IN 1973 IT DID NOT USE THE TYPE OF CELLULAR MOBILE PHONE NETWORK THAT WE USE TODAY.
THE FIRST MOBILE PHONE NETWORKS WERE CREATED IN THE LATE 1970S IN JAPAN. NOW ALMOST ALL URBAN AREAS AND MANY COUNTRY AREAS ARE COVERED BY MOBILE PHONE NETWORKS.
A CELL PHONE COMBINES TECHNOLOGIES MAINLY TELEPHONE RADIO AND COMPUTER. MOST ALSO HAVE A DIGITAL CAMERA INSIDE.
CELL PHONES WORK AS TWO WAY RADIOS. THEY SEND ELECTROMAGNETIC MICROWAVES FROM BASE STATION TO BASE STATION. THE WAVES ARE SENT THROUGH ANTENNAS. THIS IS CALLED WIRELESS COMMUNICATION.
EARLY CELL TELEPHONES USED ANALOG NETWORKS. THEY BECAME RARE LATE IN THE 20TH CENTURY. MODERN PHONES USE DIGITAL NETWORKS.
THE FIRST DIGITAL NETWORKS ARE ALSO KNOWN AS SECOND GENERATION OR 2G TECHNOLOGIES. THE MOST USED DIGITAL NETWORK IS GSM GLOBAL SYSTEM FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATION. IT IS USED MAINLY IN EUROPE AND ASIA WHILE CDMA CODE DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS NETWORKS ARE MAINLY USED IN NORTH AMERICA. THE DIFFERENCE IS IN COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL. OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE JAPAN HAVE DIFFERENT 2G PROTOCOLS. A FEW 2G NETWORKS ARE STILL USED. 3G ARE MORE COMMON AND MANY PLACES HAVE 4G.
THE RADIO WAVES THAT THE MOBILE PHONE NETWORKS USE ARE SPLIT INTO DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES. THE FREQUENCY IS MEASURED IN HZ. LOW FREQUENCIES CAN SEND THE SIGNAL FARTHER. HIGHER FREQUENCIES PROVIDE BETTER CONNECTIONS AND THE VOICE COMMUNICATIONS ARE GENERALLY CLEARER. FOUR MAIN FREQUENCIES ARE USED AROUND THE WORLD 850 900 1800 AND 1900 MHZ. EUROPE USES 900 AND 1800 MHZ AND NORTH AMERICA USES 850 AND 1900 MHZ.
TODAY THERE ARE MOBILE PHONES THAT WORK ON TWO THREE OR FOUR FREQUENCIES. THE MOST ADVANCED PHONES WORK ON ALL FREQUENCIES. THEY ARE CALLED WORLD PHONES AND CAN BE USED EVERYWHERE.
THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PHONES. A FLIP PHONE FLIPS OPEN AND IS BEST FOR CALLING. A BAR PHONE IS SHAPED LIKE A CANDY BAR AND THE KEYS AND SCREEN ARE ON ONE FACE. A SLATE PHONE IS A PHONE THAT HAS ALMOST NO BUTTONS AND USES A TOUCHSCREEN. MOST SMARTPHONES ARE SLATES. A SLIDER PHONE SLIDES ON RAILS. IT CAN SLIDE OUT NUMBER KEYS OR A MINI KEYBOARD BUT SOME DO BOTH. A SWIVEL SPINS ON AN AXLE.
WHEN A MOBILE PHONE IS SWITCHED ON ITS RADIO RECEIVER FINDS A NEARBY MOBILE PHONE NETWORK BASE STATION AND ITS TRANSMITTER SENDS A REQUEST FOR SERVICE. COMPUTERS IN THE BASE STATION CHECK IF THE PHONE IS ALLOWED TO USE THE NETWORK. THE BASE STATION COVERS AN AREA CALLED A CELL. A PHONE CAN MOVE BETWEEN DIFFERENT CELLS BUT WILL ONLY COMMUNICATE WITH ONE CELL AT A TIME. THIS IS WHY MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS ARE SOMETIMES CALLED CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS.
ONCE CONNECTED TO A STATION THE MOBILE PHONE CAN MAKE CALLS. BECAUSE THE NETWORK KNOWS THAT THE PHONE IS CONNECTED TO THAT PARTICULAR CELL IT CAN ALSO ROUTE CALLS TO THE MOBILE PHONE. SOMETIMES THE RADIO CONNECTION TO THE CELL IS LOST FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU GO UNDERGROUND. THIS MEANS THE PHONE CANNOT MAKE OR RECEIVE CALLS UNTIL THE CONNECTION IS MADE AGAIN.
THE NETWORK IS THE COMPANY THAT PROVIDES THE PHONE SERVICE. IN MOST AREAS THERE WILL BE MORE THAN ONE MOBILE NETWORK. CUSTOMERS CHOOSE NETWORKS BASED ON HOW WELL THE DIFFERENT NETWORKS WORK IN THEIR AREA OR BY PRICE.
THERE ARE TWO MAIN WAYS TO PAY FOR MOBILE PHONE CALLS 
MOBILE PHONES USE DIFFERENT TECHNICAL STANDARDS. GSM PHONES NEED A SEPARATE MICROCHIP CALLED A SUBSCRIBER IDENTITY MODULE OR SIM CARD TO WORK. THE SIM HAS INFORMATION LIKE THE PHONE NUMBER AND PAYMENT ACCOUNT AND THIS IS NEEDED TO MAKE OR RECEIVE CALLS. THE SIM MAY BE SUPPLIED BY THE SAME COMPANY AS THE PHONE OR A DIFFERENT ONE. SOMETIMES YOU CAN CHANGE THE NETWORK BY USING A SIM FROM ANOTHER NETWORK BUT SOME COMPANIES DO NOT WANT THIS TO HAPPEN AND THEY LOCK THE PHONE SO THAT YOU HAVE TO USE THEIR SIM. 
THE OTHERS HAVE A SPECIAL RADIO INSIDE THEM THAT ONLY MAKES PHONE CALLS WHEN THE PHONE IS ACTIVATED. WHEN SOMEONE BUYS A CONTRACT THE NETWORK GIVES THEM A CODE THAT IF THEY ENTER IT INTO THE PHONE THE PHONE WILL THEN MAKE CALLS. IT IS USUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT NETWORK S CODE ON THIS TYPE OF PHONE. THE MAJORITY OF THESE CDMA PHONES ARE USED IN THE UNITED STATES AND NEARBY COUNTRIES.
A MAJORITY OF NEW MOBILE PHONES FROM THE 21ST CENTURY ARE SMARTPHONES. THESE PHONES ARE BASICALLY SMALL COMPUTERS. BESIDES CALLING THEY CAN BE USED FOR EMAIL BROWSING THE INTERNET PLAYING MUSIC AND GAMES AND MANY OTHER FUNCTIONS THAT COMPUTERS CAN PERFORM. 
MOST SMARTPHONES RUN A COMMON MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEM. THIS ALLOWS DEVELOPERS TO MAKE MOBILE APPS THAT WORK ON MANY DIFFERENT PHONES WITHOUT NEEDING TO CHANGE THE CODE. EXAMPLES OF SMARTPHONES INCLUDE APPLE S IPHONE WHICH USES IOS SOFTWARE AND SAMSUNG S GALAXY SERIES ONE OF MANY PHONES THAT USE THE ANDROID PLATFORM MADE BY GOOGLE.
MONEY
MONEY IS WHAT PEOPLE USE TO BUY THINGS AND SERVICES. MONEY IS WHAT MANY PEOPLE TAKE FOR SELLING THEIR OWN THINGS OR SERVICES. THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF MONEY IN THE WORLD. MOST COUNTRIES HAVE THEIR OWN KIND OF MONEY SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR OR THE BRITISH POUND. MONEY IS ALSO CALLED MANY OTHER NAMES LIKE CURRENCY OR CASH AND PAISA INDIA.
THE IDEA OF BARTERING THINGS IS VERY OLD. A LONG TIME AGO PEOPLE DID NOT BUY OR SELL WITH MONEY. INSTEAD THEY TRADED ONE THING FOR ANOTHER TO GET WHAT THEY WANTED OR NEEDED. ONE PERSON WHO OWNED MANY COWS COULD TRADE WITH ANOTHER PERSON WHO OWNED MUCH WHEAT. EACH WOULD TRADE A LITTLE OF WHAT HE HAD WITH THE OTHER. THIS WOULD SUPPORT THE PEOPLE ON HIS FARM. OTHER THINGS THAT WERE EASIER TO CARRY AROUND THAN COWS ALSO CAME TO BE HELD AS VALUABLE. THIS GAVE RISE TO TRADE ITEMS SUCH AS JEWELRY AND SPICES. 
WHEN PEOPLE CHANGED FROM TRADING IN THINGS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE COWS AND WHEAT TO USING MONEY INSTEAD THEY NEEDED THINGS THAT WOULD LAST A LONG TIME. THEY MUST STILL HAVE A KNOWN VALUE AND COULD BE CARRIED AROUND. THE FIRST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO MAKE METAL COINS WAS CALLED LYDIA. THESE FIRST APPEARED DURING THE 7TH CENTURY BC IN THE WESTERN PART OF WHAT IS NOW TURKEY. THE LYDIAN COINS WERE MADE OF A WEIGHED AMOUNT OF PRECIOUS METAL AND WERE STAMPED WITH A PICTURE OF A LION. THIS IDEA SOON SPREAD TO GREECE THE REST OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. COINS WERE ALL MADE TO THE SAME SIZE AND SHAPE. IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD DIFFERENT THINGS HAVE BEEN USED AS MONEY LIKE CLAM SHELLS OR BLOCKS OF SALT.
BESIDES BEING EASIER TO CARRY THAN COWS USING MONEY HAD MANY OTHER ADVANTAGES. MONEY IS EASIER TO DIVIDE THAN MANY TRADE GOODS. IF SOMEONE OWN COWS AND WANTS TO TRADE FOR ONLY HALF A COW S WORTH OF WHEAT HE PROBABLY DOES NOT WANT TO CUT HIS COW IN HALF. BUT IF HE SELLS HIS COW FOR MONEY AND BUYS WHEAT WITH MONEY HE CAN GET EXACTLY THE AMOUNT HE WANTS.
COWS DIE AND WHEAT ROTS. BUT MONEY LASTS LONGER THAN MOST TRADE GOODS. IF SOMEONE SELLS A COW FOR MONEY HE CAN SAVE THAT MONEY AWAY UNTIL HE NEEDS IT. HE CAN ALWAYS LEAVE IT TO HIS CHILDREN WHEN HE DIES. IT CAN LAST A VERY LONG TIME AND HE CAN USE IT AT ANY TIME.
NOT EVERY COW IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER COW. SOME COWS ARE SICK AND OLD AND OTHERS ARE HEALTHY AND YOUNG. SOME WHEAT IS GOOD AND OTHER WHEAT IS MOLDY OR STALE. SO IF A PERSON TRADES COWS FOR WHEAT HE MIGHT HAVE A HARD TIME ARGUING OVER HOW MUCH WHEAT EACH COW IS WORTH. HOWEVER MONEY IS STANDARD. THAT MEANS ONE DOLLAR IS WORTH THE SAME AS ANOTHER DOLLAR. IT IS EASIER TO ADD UP AND COUNT MONEY THAN TO ADD UP THE VALUE OF DIFFERENT COWS OR AMOUNTS OF WHEAT. 
LATER AFTER COINS HAD BEEN USED FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS PAPER MONEY STARTED OUT AS A PROMISE TO PAY IN COIN MUCH LIKE AN I.O.U. NOTE. THE FIRST TRUE PAPER MONEY WAS USED IN CHINA IN THE 10TH CENTURY AD. PAPER MONEY WAS ALSO PRINTED IN SWEDEN BETWEEN 1660 AND 1664. BOTH TIMES IT DID NOT WORK WELL AND HAD TO BE STOPPED BECAUSE THE BANKS KEPT RUNNING OUT OF COINS TO PAY ON THE NOTES. MASSACHUSETTS BAY COLONY PRINTED PAPER MONEY IN THE 1690S. THIS TIME THE USE BECAME MORE COMMON.
TODAY MOST OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF AS MONEY IS NOT EVEN THINGS YOU CAN HOLD. IT IS NUMBERS IN BANK ACCOUNTS SAVED IN COMPUTER MEMORIES. MANY PEOPLE STILL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE USING COINS AND PAPER AND DO NOT TOTALLY TRUST USING ELECTRONIC MONEY ON A COMPUTER MEMORY.
MANY TYPES OF MONEY HAVE BEEN USED AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN HISTORY. THESE ARE 
COMMODITY MONEY CAN BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES BESIDES SERVING AS A MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE. WE SAY IT POSSESSES INTRINSIC VALUE BECAUSE IT IS USEFUL OR VALUABLE BY ITSELF. SOME EXAMPLES OF COMMODITY MONEY ARE CATTLE SILK GOLD AND SILVER. CONVERTIBLE PAPER MONEY IS MONEY THAT IS CONVERTIBLE INTO GOLD AND SILVER. GOLD AND SILVER CERTIFICATES ARE CONVERTIBLE PAPER MONEY AS THEY CAN BE FULLY CONVERTIBLE INTO GOLD AND SILVER. 
INCONVERTIBLE MONEY IS MONEY THAT CANNOT BE CONVERTED INTO GOLD AND SILVER. NOTES AND COINS ARE INCONVERTIBLE MONEY. THEY ARE INCONVERTIBLE AND ARE DECLARED BY THE GOVERNMENT MONEY. SUCH FIAT MONEY IS A COUNTRY S LEGAL TENDER. TODAY NOTES AND COINS ARE THE CURRENCIES USED IN BANK DEPOSITS. 
TYPES OF BANK DEPOSITS 
MOVIE
MOVIES ALSO KNOWN AS FILMS ARE A TYPE OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION WHICH USES MOVING PICTURES AND SOUND TO TELL STORIES OR INFORM HELP PEOPLE TO LEARN. PEOPLE IN EVERY PART OF THE WORLD WATCH MOVIES AS A TYPE OF ENTERTAINMENT A WAY TO HAVE FUN. FOR SOME PEOPLE FUN MOVIES CAN MEAN MOVIES THAT MAKE THEM LAUGH WHILE FOR OTHERS IT CAN MEAN MOVIES THAT MAKE THEM CRY OR FEEL AFRAID. 
MOST MOVIES ARE MADE SO THAT THEY CAN BE SHOWN ON BIG SCREENS AT MOVIE THEATRES AND AT HOME. AFTER MOVIES ARE SHOWN ON MOVIE SCREENS FOR A PERIOD OF WEEKS OR MONTHS THEY MAY BE MARKETED THROUGH SEVERAL OTHER MEDIA. THEY ARE SHOWN ON PAY TELEVISION OR CABLE TELEVISION AND SOLD OR RENTED ON DVD DISKS OR VIDEOCASSETTE TAPES SO THAT PEOPLE CAN WATCH THE MOVIES AT HOME. YOU CAN ALSO DOWNLOAD OR STREAM MOVIES. OLDER MOVIES ARE SHOWN ON TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS.
A MOVIE CAMERA OR VIDEO CAMERA TAKES PICTURES VERY QUICKLY USUALLY AT 24 OR 25 PICTURES FRAMES EVERY SECOND. WHEN A MOVIE PROJECTOR A COMPUTER OR A TELEVISION SHOWS THE PICTURES AT THAT RATE IT LOOKS LIKE THE THINGS SHOWN IN THE SET OF PICTURES ARE REALLY MOVING. SOUND IS EITHER RECORDED AT THE SAME TIME OR ADDED LATER. THE SOUNDS IN A MOVIE USUALLY INCLUDE THE SOUNDS OF PEOPLE TALKING WHICH IS CALLED DIALOGUE MUSIC WHICH IS CALLED THE SOUNDTRACK AND SOUND EFFECTS THE SOUNDS OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE MOVIE SUCH AS DOORS OPENING OR GUNS BEING FIRED. IN THE 20TH CENTURY THE CAMERA USED PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM. THE PRODUCT IS STILL OFTEN CALLED A FILM EVEN THOUGH THERE USUALLY IS NO FILM.
A SCREENWRITER WRITES A SCRIPT WHICH IS THE STORY OF THE MOVIE WITH WORDS AND THINGS THAT THE ACTORS WILL SAY AND DO. THEN A PRODUCER HIRES PEOPLE TO WORK ON THE MOVIE AND GETS ALL OF THE MONEY THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO PAY FOR THE ACTORS AND THE EQUIPMENT. PRODUCERS USUALLY GET THE MONEY BY BORROWING IT FROM A BANK OR BY GETTING INVESTORS TO LEND MONEY TO THE MOVIE PRODUCTION. SOME PRODUCERS WORK FOR A MOVIE STUDIO OTHER PRODUCERS ARE INDEPENDENT THEY DO NOT WORK FOR A MOVIE STUDIO.
ACTORS AND DIRECTORS READ SCRIPTS TO FIND OUT WHAT TO SAY AND WHAT TO DO. THE ACTORS MEMORIZE THE WORDS FROM THE SCRIPT THAT THEY WILL SAY IN THE MOVIE AND LEARN THE ACTIONS THAT THE SCRIPT TELLS THEM TO DO. THEN THE DIRECTOR TELLS THE ACTORS WHAT TO DO AND A CAMERAMAN TAKES MOTION PICTURES OF THEM WITH A MOTION PICTURE CAMERA.
WHEN FILMING HAS FINISHED AN EDITOR PUTS THE MOVING PICTURES TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT TELLS THE WHOLE STORY WITHIN A SET AMOUNT OF TIME. AUDIO ENGINEERS AND SOUND ENGINEERS RECORD MUSIC AND SINGING AND JOIN IT WITH THE MOVING PICTURES. WHEN THE MOVIE IS DONE MANY COPIES OF THE MOVIE ARE MADE BY MOVIE LABS AND PUT ONTO FILM REELS. THEN THE REELS ARE SENT TO CINEMAS. AN ELECTRIC MACHINE CALLED A PROJECTOR SHINES A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT THROUGH THE FILM AND PEOPLE SITTING IN A DARK ROOM SEE IT ON A BIG SCREEN.
A GENRE IS A WORD FOR A TYPE OF MOVIE OR A STYLE OF MOVIE. MOVIES CAN BE FICTIONAL MADE UP OR TRUE OR A MIX OF THE TWO. ALTHOUGH HUNDREDS OF MOVIES ARE MADE EVERY YEAR THERE ARE VERY FEW THAT DO NOT FOLLOW A SMALL NUMBER OF SET PLOTS OR STORIES. SOME MOVIES MIX TOGETHER TWO OR MORE GENRES.
MOST MOVIES LOSE MONEY BUT SOME MAKE PROFITS IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS BE THEY DOLLARS EURO OR POUNDS. IN INDIA MOVIES HAVE BECOME AN ENORMOUS PART OF THE ECONOMY. THE INDUSTRY HAS ALWAYS BEEN DOMINATED BY A FEW MAJOR MOVIE STUDIOS LIKE MGM UA WARNER BROS. COLUMBIA LUCASFILM PARAMOUNT OR DISNEY. THERE ARE MANY LARGE COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE ALL OF THE SERVICES NEEDED TO MAKE MOVIES SUCH AS SPECIAL EFFECTS LIGHTING SET BUILDING. MANY OF THESE EMPLOYEES BELONG TO TRADE UNIONS WHO SAY HOW MUCH THEIR MEMBERS MUST BE PAID. A HUGE NUMBER OF SMALLER COMPANIES ALSO OFFER SERVICES SUCH AS MUSIC STUDIOS WHICH RECORD THE MUSIC FOR ORIGINAL MOVIE SOUND TRACKS AND CGI COMPUTER ANIMATION. FINALLY THERE ARE MOVIE DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES WHICH SEND MOVIES AROUND THE WORLD OR AROUND A COUNTRY AND ADVERTISING COMPANIES WHO LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE MOVIE AND PROMOTE IT TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE.
MOVIES WITH FAMOUS STARS AND LARGE BUDGETS LOTS OF MONEY ARE DESIGNED TO HAVE A WIDE APPEAL SO THAT HOPEFULLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WILL PAY TO SEE THEM. THESE MOST EXPENSIVE MOVIES ARE CALLED BLOCKBUSTERS. SPECIAL EFFECTS CAN ADD A HUGE AMOUNT TO THE COST OF A MOVIE ESPECIALLY THE NEWEST CGI EFFECTS BUT PEOPLE HAVE COME TO EXPECT THEM AND EVERY BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE TRIES TO OUT DO THE LAST. EVEN IN 2008 SOME MOVIES COST UP TO 200 MILLION TO MAKE. VERY SUCCESSFUL MOVIES CAN MAKE MANY TIMES THAT AMOUNT IN PROFIT AND THAT S WHY THE STUDIOS KEEP PRODUCING THEM. THIS KIND OF MOVIE WILL HAVE A LOT OF PROMOTION THROUGH TELEVISION ADVERTISING BILLBOARDS AND INTERNET SITES. IN BLOCKBUSTER MOVIES THERE IS USUALLY A HAPPY ENDING IN WHICH ALL OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE PLOT STORY ARE FIGURED OUT OR FIXED AND ALMOST EVERYONE EXCEPT THE BADDIE LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER. SOME MOVIES HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT THE STUDIOS KEEP RELEASING MORE AND MORE SEQUELS OR MOVIES WITH THE SAME CHARACTERS AND BASIC PLOTS.
AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE SCALE TO THE BLOCKBUSTER THERE IS THE INDEPENDENT ART OR INDIE MOVIE. THESE ARE USUALLY MADE BY SMALL MOVIE COMPANIES OR EVEN JUST A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT DO NOT HAVE MUCH MONEY. AN EXAMPLE IS THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT WHICH COST ONLY ABOUT 60 000 BUT WHICH HAS SO FAR TAKEN PERHAPS 200 MILLION IN TICKET AND DVD SALES. MOVIES LIKE THIS ARE VERY UNUSUAL AND USUALLY BECOME POPULAR UNDERGROUND WORD OF MOUTH ADVERTISING SO THAT THEY BECOME CULT OR POPULAR BUT NOT MAINSTREAM. INDEPENDENT MOVIES OFTEN TELL MORE CREATIVE OR UNUSUAL STRANGE STORIES OR MAY HAVE SAD ENDINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAL TO THE BIG STUDIOS BECAUSE THEY CAN NOT BE SURE HOW THE PUBLIC WILL REACT TO THEM. THEY RARELY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL THE BIG STUDIOS WILL QUICKLY TRY TO GET THE PEOPLE INVOLVED TO SIGN A CONTRACT WITH THEM BY OFFERING THEM A LOT OF MONEY TO MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE. OFTEN THE NEW MOVIE WITH ITS BIG BUDGET AND ITS STARS WILL BE LESS SUCCESSFUL THAN THE FIRST.
MUSIC
MUSIC IS A FORM OF ART AN EXPRESSION OF EMOTIONS THROUGH HARMONIC FREQUENCIES. MUSIC IS ALSO A FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT THAT PUTS SOUNDS TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE LIKE FIND INTERESTING OR DANCE TO. MOST MUSIC INCLUDES PEOPLE SINGING WITH THEIR VOICES OR PLAYING MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE PIANO GUITAR DRUMS OR VIOLIN.
THE WORD MUSIC COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD MOUSIKE WHICH MEANS ART OF THE MUSES. IN ANCIENT GREECE THE MUSES INCLUDED THE GODDESSES OF MUSIC POETRY ART AND DANCE. SOMEONE WHO MAKES MUSIC IS KNOWN AS A MUSICIAN.
MUSIC IS SOUND THAT HAS BEEN ORGANIZED BY USING RHYTHM MELODY OR HARMONY. IF SOMEONE BANGS SAUCEPANS WHILE COOKING IT MAKES NOISE. IF A PERSON BANGS SAUCEPANS OR POTS IN A RHYTHMIC WAY THEY ARE MAKING A SIMPLE TYPE OF MUSIC.
THERE ARE FOUR THINGS WHICH MUSIC HAS MOST OF THE TIME 
THERE IS NO SIMPLE DEFINITION OF MUSIC WHICH COVERS ALL CASES. IT IS AN ART FORM AND OPINIONS COME INTO PLAY. MUSIC IS WHATEVER PEOPLE THINK IS MUSIC. A DIFFERENT APPROACH IS TO LIST THE QUALITIES MUSIC MUST HAVE SUCH AS SOUND WHICH HAS RHYTHM MELODY PITCH TIMBRE ETC.
THESE AND OTHER ATTEMPTS DO NOT CAPTURE ALL ASPECTS OF MUSIC OR LEAVE OUT EXAMPLES WHICH DEFINITELY ARE MUSIC. ACCORDING TO THOMAS CLIFTON MUSIC IS A CERTAIN RECIPROCAL RELATION ESTABLISHED BETWEEN A PERSON HIS BEHAVIOR AND A SOUNDING OBJECT. MUSICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE MUSIC TOGETHER ARE CALLED PHENOMENA AND THE ACTIVITY OF DESCRIBING PHENOMENA IS CALLED PHENOMENOLOGY.
EVEN IN THE STONE AGE PEOPLE MADE MUSIC. THE FIRST MUSIC WAS PROBABLY MADE TRYING TO IMITATE SOUNDS AND RHYTHMS THAT OCCURRED NATURALLY. HUMAN MUSIC MAY ECHO THESE PHENOMENA USING PATTERNS REPETITION AND TONALITY. THIS KIND OF MUSIC IS STILL HERE TODAY. SHAMANS SOMETIMES IMITATE SOUNDS THAT ARE HEARD IN NATURE. IT MAY ALSO SERVE AS ENTERTAINMENT GAMES OR HAVE PRACTICAL USES LIKE ATTRACTING ANIMALS WHEN HUNTING.
SOME ANIMALS ALSO CAN USE MUSIC. SONGBIRDS USE SONG TO PROTECT THEIR TERRITORY OR TO ATTRACT A MATE. MONKEYS HAVE BEEN SEEN BEATING HOLLOW LOGS. THIS MAY OF COURSE ALSO SERVE TO DEFEND THE TERRITORY.
THE FIRST MUSICAL INSTRUMENT USED BY HUMANS WAS PROBABLY THE VOICE. THE HUMAN VOICE CAN MAKE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOUNDS. THE LARYNX VOICE BOX IS LIKE A WIND INSTRUMENT.
THE OLDEST KNOWN NEANDERTHAL HYOID BONE WITH THE MODERN HUMAN FORM WAS FOUND IN 1983 INDICATING THAT THE NEANDERTHALS HAD LANGUAGE BECAUSE THE HYOID SUPPORTS THE VOICE BOX IN THE HUMAN THROAT.
MOST LIKELY THE FIRST RHYTHM INSTRUMENTS OR PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS INVOLVED THE CLAPPING OF HANDS STONES HIT TOGETHER OR OTHER THINGS THAT ARE USEFUL TO KEEP A BEAT. THERE ARE FINDS OF THIS TYPE THAT DATE BACK TO THE PALEOLITHIC. SOME OF THESE ARE AMBIGUOUS AS THEY CAN BE USED EITHER AS A TOOL OR A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT.
THE OLDEST FLUTE EVER DISCOVERED MAY BE THE SO CALLED DIVJE BABE FLUTE FOUND IN THE SLOVENIAN CAVE DIVJE BABE I IN 1995. IT IS NOT CERTAIN THAT THE OBJECT IS REALLY A FLUTE. THE ITEM IN QUESTION IS A FRAGMENT OF THE FEMUR OF A YOUNG CAVE BEAR AND HAS BEEN DATED TO ABOUT 43 000 YEARS AGO. HOWEVER WHETHER IT IS TRULY A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT OR SIMPLY A CARNIVORE CHEWED BONE IS A MATTER OF ONGOING DEBATE.
IN 2008 ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVERED A BONE FLUTE IN THE HOHLE FELS CAVE NEAR ULM GERMANY.
WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED THEIR DISCOVERY THE SCIENTISTS SUGGESTED THAT THE FINDS DEMONSTRATE THE PRESENCE OF A WELL ESTABLISHED MUSICAL TRADITION AT THE TIME WHEN MODERN HUMANS COLONIZED EUROPE.
THE OLDEST KNOWN WOODEN PIPES WERE DISCOVERED NEAR GREYSTONES IRELAND IN 2004. A WOOD LINED PIT CONTAINED A GROUP OF SIX FLUTES MADE FROM YEW WOOD BETWEEN 30 AND 50 CM LONG TAPERED AT ONE END BUT WITHOUT ANY FINGER HOLES. THEY MAY ONCE HAVE BEEN STRAPPED TOGETHER.
IN 1986 SEVERAL BONE FLUTES WERE FOUND IN JIAHU IN HENAN PROVINCE CHINA. THEY DATE TO ABOUT 6 000 BC. THEY HAVE BETWEEN 5 AND 8 HOLES EACH AND WERE MADE FROM THE HOLLOW BONES OF A BIRD THE RED CROWNED CRANE. AT THE TIME OF THE DISCOVERY ONE WAS FOUND TO BE STILL PLAYABLE. THE BONE FLUTE PLAYS BOTH THE FIVE OR SEVEN NOTE SCALE OF XIA ZHI AND SIX NOTE SCALE OF QING SHANG OF THE ANCIENT CHINESE MUSICAL SYSTEM.
IT IS NOT KNOWN WHAT THE EARLIEST MUSIC OF THE CAVE PEOPLE WAS LIKE. SOME ARCHITECTURE EVEN SOME PAINTINGS ARE THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD BUT OLD MUSIC COULD NOT SURVIVE UNTIL PEOPLE LEARNED TO WRITE IT DOWN. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GUESS ABOUT EARLY MUSIC IS BY LOOKING AT VERY OLD PAINTINGS THAT SHOW PEOPLE PLAYING MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS OR BY FINDING THEM IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGS DIGGING UNDERGROUND TO FIND OLD THINGS. THE EARLIEST PIECE OF MUSIC THAT WAS EVER WRITTEN DOWN AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN LOST WAS DISCOVERED ON A TABLET WRITTEN IN HURRIAN A LANGUAGE SPOKEN IN AND AROUND NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA WHERE IRAQ IS TODAY FROM ABOUT 1500 BC.
ANOTHER EARLY PIECE OF WRITTEN MUSIC THAT HAS SURVIVED WAS A ROUND CALLED SUMER IS ICUMEN IN. IT WAS WRITTEN DOWN BY A MONK AROUND THE YEAR 1250. MUCH OF THE MUSIC IN THE MIDDLE AGES ROUGHLY 450 1420 WAS FOLK MUSIC PLAYED BY WORKING PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO SING OR DANCE. WHEN PEOPLE PLAYED INSTRUMENTS THEY WERE USUALLY PLAYING FOR DANCERS. HOWEVER MOST OF THE MUSIC THAT WAS WRITTEN DOWN WAS FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THIS MUSIC WAS WRITTEN FOR MONKS TO SING IN CHURCH. IT IS CALLED CHANT OR GREGORIAN CHANT.
IN THE RENAISSANCE ROUGHLY 1400 1550 THERE WAS A LOT OF MUSIC AND MANY COMPOSERS WROTE MUSIC THAT HAS SURVIVED SO THAT IT CAN BE PERFORMED PLAYED OR SUNG TODAY. THE NAME FOR THIS PERIOD RENAISSANCE IS A FRENCH WORD WHICH MEANS REBIRTH. THIS PERIOD WAS CALLED THE REBIRTH BECAUSE MANY NEW TYPES OF ART AND MUSIC WERE REBORN DURING THIS TIME.
SOME VERY BEAUTIFUL MUSIC WAS WRITTEN FOR USE IN CHURCH SERVICES SACRED MUSIC BY THE ITALIAN COMPOSER GIOVANNI DA PALESTRINA 1525 1594. IN PALESTRINA S MUSIC MANY SINGERS SING TOGETHER THIS IS CALLED A CHOIR. THERE WAS ALSO PLENTY OF MUSIC NOT WRITTEN FOR THE CHURCH SUCH AS HAPPY DANCE MUSIC AND ROMANTIC LOVE SONGS. POPULAR INSTRUMENTS DURING THE RENAISSANCE INCLUDED THE VIOLS A STRING INSTRUMENT PLAYED WITH A BOW LUTES A PLUCKED STRINGED INSTRUMENT THAT IS A LITTLE LIKE A GUITAR AND THE VIRGINAL A SMALL QUIET KEYBOARD INSTRUMENT.
IN THE ARTS THE BAROQUE WAS A WESTERN CULTURAL ERA WHICH BEGAN NEAR THE TURN OF THE 17TH CENTURY IN ROME. IT WAS EXEMPLIFIED BY DRAMA AND GRANDEUR IN SCULPTURE PAINTING LITERATURE DANCE AND MUSIC. IN MUSIC THE TERM BAROQUE APPLIES TO THE FINAL PERIOD OF DOMINANCE OF IMITATIVE COUNTERPOINT WHERE DIFFERENT VOICES AND INSTRUMENTS ECHO EACH OTHER BUT AT DIFFERENT PITCHES SOMETIMES INVERTING THE ECHO AND EVEN REVERSING THEMATIC MATERIAL.
THE POPULARITY AND SUCCESS OF THE BAROQUE STYLE WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH WHICH HAD DECIDED AT THE TIME OF THE COUNCIL OF TRENT THAT THE ARTS SHOULD COMMUNICATE RELIGIOUS THEMES IN DIRECT AND EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT. THE UPPER CLASS ALSO SAW THE DRAMATIC STYLE OF BAROQUE ARCHITECTURE AND ART AS A MEANS OF IMPRESSING VISITORS AND EXPRESSING TRIUMPHANT POWER AND CONTROL. BAROQUE PALACES ARE BUILT AROUND AN ENTRANCE OF COURTS GRAND STAIRCASES AND RECEPTION ROOMS OF SEQUENTIALLY INCREASING OPULENCE. IN SIMILAR PROFUSIONS OF DETAIL ART MUSIC ARCHITECTURE AND LITERATURE INSPIRED EACH OTHER IN THE BAROQUE CULTURAL MOVEMENT AS ARTISTS EXPLORED WHAT THEY COULD CREATE FROM REPEATED AND VARIED PATTERNS. SOME TRAITS AND ASPECTS OF BAROQUE PAINTINGS THAT DIFFERENTIATE THIS STYLE FROM OTHERS ARE THE ABUNDANT AMOUNT OF DETAILS OFTEN BRIGHT POLYCHROMY LESS REALISTIC FACES OF SUBJECTS AND AN OVERALL SENSE OF AWE WHICH WAS ONE OF THE GOALS IN BAROQUE ART.
THE WORD BAROQUE PROBABLY DERIVES FROM THE ANCIENT PORTUGUESE NOUN BARROCO WHICH IS A PEARL THAT IS NOT ROUND BUT OF UNPREDICTABLE AND ELABORATE SHAPE. HENCE IN INFORMAL USAGE THE WORD BAROQUE CAN SIMPLY MEAN THAT SOMETHING IS ELABORATE WITH MANY DETAILS WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE BAROQUE STYLES OF THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES.
IN WESTERN MUSIC THE CLASSICAL PERIOD MEANS MUSIC FROM ABOUT 1750 TO 1825. IT WAS THE TIME OF COMPOSERS LIKE JOSEPH HAYDN WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART AND LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN. ORCHESTRAS BECAME BIGGER AND COMPOSERS OFTEN WROTE LONGER PIECES OF MUSIC CALLED SYMPHONIES THAT HAD SEVERAL SECTIONS CALLED MOVEMENTS. SOME MOVEMENTS OF A SYMPHONY WERE LOUD AND FAST OTHER MOVEMENTS WERE QUIET AND SAD. THE FORM OF A PIECE OF MUSIC WAS VERY IMPORTANT AT THIS TIME. MUSIC HAD TO HAVE A NICE SHAPE. THEY OFTEN USED A STRUCTURE WHICH WAS CALLED SONATA FORM.
ANOTHER IMPORTANT TYPE OF MUSIC WAS THE STRING QUARTET WHICH IS A PIECE OF MUSIC WRITTEN FOR TWO VIOLINS A VIOLA AND A VIOLONCELLO. LIKE SYMPHONIES STRING QUARTET MUSIC HAD SEVERAL SECTIONS. HAYDN MOZART AND BEETHOVEN EACH WROTE MANY FAMOUS STRING QUARTETS.
THE PIANO WAS INVENTED DURING THIS TIME. COMPOSERS LIKED THE PIANO BECAUSE IT COULD BE USED TO PLAY DYNAMICS GETTING LOUDER OR GETTING SOFTER. OTHER POPULAR INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED THE VIOLIN THE VIOLONCELLO THE FLUTE THE CLARINET AND THE OBOE.
THE 19TH CENTURY IS CALLED THE ROMANTIC PERIOD. COMPOSERS WERE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN CONVEYING THEIR EMOTIONS THROUGH MUSIC. AN IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT FROM THE ROMANTIC PERIOD WAS THE PIANO. SOME COMPOSERS SUCH AS FREDERIC CHOPIN WROTE SUBDUED EXPRESSIVE QUIETLY EMOTIONAL PIANO PIECES. OFTEN MUSIC DESCRIBED A FEELING OR TOLD A STORY USING SOUNDS. OTHER COMPOSERS SUCH AS FRANZ SCHUBERT WROTE SONGS FOR A SINGER AND A PIANO PLAYER CALLED LIED THE GERMAN WORD FOR SONG. THESE LIEDER PLURAL OF LIED TOLD STORIES BY USING THE LYRICS WORDS OF THE SONG AND BY THE IMAGINATIVE PIANO ACCOMPANIMENTS. OTHER COMPOSERS LIKE RICHARD STRAUSS AND FRANZ LISZT CREATED NARRATIVES AND TOLD STORIES USING ONLY MUSIC WHICH IS CALLED A TONE POEM. COMPOSERS SUCH AS FRANZ LISZT AND JOHANNES BRAHMS USED THE PIANO TO PLAY LOUD DRAMATIC STRONGLY EMOTIONAL MUSIC.
MANY COMPOSERS BEGAN WRITING MUSIC FOR BIGGER ORCHESTRAS WITH AS MANY AS 100 INSTRUMENTS. IT WAS THE PERIOD OF NATIONALISM THE FEELING OF BEING PROUD OF ONE S COUNTRY WHEN MANY COMPOSERS MADE MUSIC USING FOLKSONG OR MELODIES FROM THEIR COUNTRY. LOTS OF FAMOUS COMPOSERS LIVED AT THIS TIME SUCH AS FRANZ SCHUBERT FELIX MENDELSSOHN FREDERIC CHOPIN JOHANNES BRAHMS PYOTR TCHAIKOVSKY AND RICHARD WAGNER.
FROM ABOUT 1900 ONWARDS IS CALLED THE MODERN PERIOD. MANY 20TH CENTURY COMPOSERS WANTED TO COMPOSE MUSIC THAT SOUNDED DIFFERENT FROM THE CLASSICAL AND ROMANTIC MUSIC. MODERN COMPOSERS SEARCHED FOR NEW IDEAS SUCH AS USING NEW INSTRUMENTS DIFFERENT FORMS DIFFERENT SOUNDS OR DIFFERENT HARMONIES.
THE COMPOSER ARNOLD SCHOENBERG 1874 1951 WROTE PIECES WHICH WERE ATONAL MEANING THAT THEY DID NOT SOUND AS IF THEY WERE IN ANY CLEAR MUSICAL KEY. LATER SCHOENBERG INVENTED A NEW SYSTEM FOR WRITING MUSIC CALLED TWELVE TONE SYSTEM. MUSIC WRITTEN WITH THE TWELVE TONE SYSTEM SOUNDS STRANGE TO SOME BUT IS MATHEMATICAL IN NATURE OFTEN MAKING SENSE ONLY AFTER CAREFUL STUDY. PURE TWELVE TONE MUSIC WAS POPULAR AMONG ACADEMICS IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES BUT SOME COMPOSERS SUCH AS BENJAMIN BRITTEN USE IT TODAY WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO GET A CERTAIN FEEL.
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 20TH CENTURY COMPOSERS IGOR STRAVINSKY 1882 1971 WROTE MUSIC WITH VERY COMPLICATED DIFFICULT CHORDS GROUPS OF NOTES THAT ARE PLAYED TOGETHER AND RHYTHMS. SOME COMPOSERS THOUGHT MUSIC WAS GETTING TOO COMPLICATED AND SO THEY WROTE MINIMALIST PIECES WHICH USE VERY SIMPLE IDEAS. IN THE 1950S AND 1960S COMPOSERS SUCH AS KARLHEINZ STOCKHAUSEN EXPERIMENTED WITH ELECTRONIC MUSIC USING ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS AMPLIFIERS AND LOUDSPEAKERS. IN THE 1970S COMPOSERS BEGAN USING ELECTRONIC SYNTHESIZERS AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS FROM ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC SUCH AS THE ELECTRIC GUITAR. THEY USED THESE NEW INSTRUMENTS TO MAKE NEW SOUNDS.
COMPOSERS WRITING IN THE 1990S AND THE 2000S SUCH AS JOHN ADAMS BORN 1947 AND JAMES MACMILLAN BORN 1959 OFTEN USE A MIXTURE OF ALL THESE IDEAS BUT THEY LIKE TO WRITE TONAL MUSIC WITH EASY TUNES AS WELL.
MUSIC CAN BE PRODUCED ELECTRONICALLY. THIS IS MOST COMMONLY DONE BY COMPUTERS KEYBOARDS ELECTRIC GUITARS AND DISK TABLES. THEY CAN MIMIC TRADITIONAL INSTRUMENTS AND ALSO PRODUCE VERY DIFFERENT SOUNDS. 21ST CENTURY ELECTRONIC MUSIC IS COMMONLY MADE WITH COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND HARDWARE MIXERS.
JAZZ IS A TYPE OF MUSIC THAT WAS INVENTED AROUND 1900 IN NEW ORLEANS IN THE SOUTH OF THE USA. THERE WERE MANY BLACK MUSICIANS LIVING THERE WHO PLAYED A STYLE OF MUSIC CALLED BLUES MUSIC. BLUES MUSIC WAS INFLUENCED BY AFRICAN MUSIC BECAUSE THE BLACK PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAD COME TO THE UNITED STATES AS SLAVES. THEY WERE TAKEN FROM AFRICA BY FORCE. BLUES MUSIC WAS A MUSIC THAT WAS PLAYED BY SINGING USING THE HARMONICA OR THE ACOUSTIC GUITAR. MANY BLUES SONGS HAD SAD LYRICS ABOUT SAD EMOTIONS FEELINGS OR SAD EXPERIENCES SUCH AS LOSING A JOB A FAMILY MEMBER DYING OR HAVING TO GO TO JAIL PRISON.
JAZZ MUSIC MIXED TOGETHER BLUES MUSIC WITH EUROPEAN MUSIC. SOME BLACK COMPOSERS SUCH AS SCOTT JOPLIN WERE WRITING MUSIC CALLED RAGTIME WHICH HAD A VERY DIFFERENT RHYTHM FROM STANDARD EUROPEAN MUSIC BUT USED NOTES THAT WERE SIMILAR TO SOME EUROPEAN MUSIC. RAGTIME WAS A BIG INFLUENCE ON EARLY JAZZ CALLED DIXIELAND JAZZ. JAZZ MUSICIANS USED INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE TRUMPET SAXOPHONE AND CLARINET WERE USED FOR THE TUNES MELODIES DRUMS FOR PERCUSSION AND PLUCKED DOUBLE BASS PIANO BANJO AND GUITAR FOR THE BACKGROUND RHYTHM RHYTHMIC SECTION. JAZZ IS USUALLY IMPROVISED THE PLAYERS MAKE UP INVENT THE MUSIC AS THEY PLAY. EVEN THOUGH JAZZ MUSICIANS ARE MAKING UP THE MUSIC JAZZ MUSIC STILL HAS RULES THE MUSICIANS PLAY A SERIES OF CHORDS GROUPS OF NOTES IN ORDER.
JAZZ MUSIC HAS A SWINGING RHYTHM. THE WORD SWING IS HARD TO EXPLAIN. FOR A RHYTHM TO BE A SWINGING RHYTHM IT HAS TO FEEL NATURAL AND RELAXED. SWING RHYTHM IS NOT EVEN LIKE A MARCH. THERE IS A LONG SHORT FEEL INSTEAD OF A SAME SAME FEEL. A SWINGING RHYTHM ALSO GETS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTENING EXCITED BECAUSE THEY LIKE THE SOUND OF IT. SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT A SWINGING RHYTHM HAPPENS WHEN ALL THE JAZZ MUSICIANS START TO FEEL THE SAME PULSE AND ENERGY FROM THE SONG. IF A JAZZ BAND PLAYS VERY WELL TOGETHER PEOPLE WILL SAY THAT IS A SWINGING JAZZ BAND OR THAT BAND REALLY SWINGS WELL. 
JAZZ INFLUENCED OTHER TYPES OF MUSIC LIKE THE WESTERN ART MUSIC FROM THE 1920S AND 1930S. ART MUSIC COMPOSERS SUCH AS GEORGE GERSHWIN WROTE MUSIC THAT WAS INFLUENCED BY JAZZ. JAZZ MUSIC INFLUENCED POP MUSIC SONGS. IN THE 1930S AND 1940S MANY POP MUSIC SONGS BEGAN USING CHORDS OR MELODIES FROM JAZZ SONGS. ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN JAZZ MUSICIANS WAS LOUIS ARMSTRONG 1900 1971.
POP MUSIC IS A TYPE OF POPULAR MUSIC THAT MANY PEOPLE LIKE TO LISTEN TO. THE TERM POP MUSIC CAN BE USED FOR ALL KINDS OF MUSIC THAT WAS WRITTEN TO BE POPULAR. THE WORD POP MUSIC WAS USED FROM ABOUT 1880 ONWARDS WHEN A TYPE OF MUSIC CALLED MUSIC WAS POPULAR.
MODERN POP MUSIC GREW OUT OF 1950S ROCK AND ROLL FOR EXAMPLE CHUCK BERRY BO DIDDLEY AND LITTLE RICHARD AND ROCKABILLY FOR EXAMPLE ELVIS PRESLEY AND BUDDY HOLLY. IN THE 1960S THE BEATLES BECAME A FAMOUS POP MUSIC GROUP. IN THE 1970S OTHER STYLES OF MUSIC WERE MIXED WITH POP MUSIC SUCH AS FUNK AND SOUL MUSIC. POP MUSIC GENERALLY HAS A HEAVY STRONG BEAT SO THAT IT IS GOOD FOR DANCING. POP SINGERS NORMALLY SING WITH MICROPHONES THAT ARE PLUGGED INTO AN AMPLIFIER AND A LOUDSPEAKER.
MUSICAL NOTATION IS THE WAY MUSIC IS WRITTEN DOWN. MUSIC NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN DOWN IN ORDER TO BE SAVED AND REMEMBERED FOR FUTURE PERFORMANCES. IN THIS WAY COMPOSERS PEOPLE WHO WRITE MUSIC CAN TELL OTHERS HOW TO PLAY THE MUSICAL PIECE AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE PLAYED.
SOLF GE ALSO CALLED SOLFA IS THE WAY TONES ARE NAMED. IT WAS MADE IN ORDER TO GIVE A NAME TO THE SEVERAL TONES AND PITCHES. FOR EXAMPLE THE EIGHT BASIC NOTES DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO ARE JUST THE NAMES OF THE EIGHT NOTES THAT CONFIRM THE MAJOR SCALE.
MUSIC CAN BE WRITTEN IN SEVERAL WAYS. WHEN IT IS WRITTEN ON A STAFF LIKE IN THE EXAMPLE SHOWN THE PITCHES TONES AND THEIR DURATION ARE REPRESENTED BY SYMBOLS CALLED NOTES. NOTES ARE PUT ON THE LINES AND IN THE SPACES BETWEEN THE LINES. EACH POSITION SAYS WHICH TONE MUST BE PLAYED. THE HIGHER THE NOTE IS ON THE STAFF THE HIGHER THE PITCH OF THE TONE. THE LOWER THE NOTES ARE THE LOWER THE PITCH. THE DURATION OF THE NOTES HOW LONG THEY ARE PLAYED FOR IS SHOWN BY MAKING THE NOTE HEADS BLACK OR WHITE AND BY GIVING THEM STEMS AND FLAGS.
MUSIC CAN ALSO BE WRITTEN WITH LETTERS NAMING THEM AS IN THE SOLFA DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO OR REPRESENTING THEM BY LETTERS. THE NEXT TABLE SHOWS HOW EACH NOTE OF THE SOLFA IS REPRESENTED IN THE STANDARD NOTATION 
THE STANDARD NOTATION WAS MADE TO SIMPLIFY THE LECTURE OF MUSIC NOTES ALTHOUGH IT IS MOSTLY USED TO REPRESENT CHORDS AND THE NAMES OF THE MUSIC SCALES.
THESE WAYS TO REPRESENT MUSIC EASE THE WAY A PERSON READS MUSIC. THERE ARE MORE WAYS TO WRITE AND REPRESENT MUSIC BUT THEY ARE LESS KNOWN AND MAY BE MORE COMPLICATED.
PEOPLE CAN ENJOY MUSIC BY LISTENING TO IT. THEY CAN GO TO CONCERTS TO HEAR MUSICIANS PERFORM. CLASSICAL MUSIC IS USUALLY PERFORMED IN CONCERT HALLS BUT SOMETIMES HUGE FESTIVALS ARE ORGANIZED IN WHICH IT IS PERFORMED OUTSIDE IN A FIELD OR STADIUM LIKE POP FESTIVALS. PEOPLE CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC ON CDS COMPUTERS IPODS TELEVISION THE RADIO CASSETTE RECORD PLAYERS AND EVEN MOBILE PHONES.
THERE IS SO MUCH MUSIC TODAY IN ELEVATORS SHOPPING MALLS AND STORES THAT IT OFTEN BECOMES A BACKGROUND SOUND THAT WE DO NOT REALLY HEAR. 
PEOPLE CAN LEARN TO PLAY AN INSTRUMENT. PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON FOR COMPLETE BEGINNERS IS THE PIANO OR KEYBOARD THE GUITAR OR THE RECORDER WHICH IS CERTAINLY THE CHEAPEST TO BUY. AFTER THEY HAVE LEARNT TO PLAY SCALES PLAY SIMPLE TUNES AND READ THE SIMPLEST MUSICAL NOTATION THEN THEY CAN THINK ABOUT WHICH INSTRUMENT FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. THEY SHOULD CHOOSE AN INSTRUMENT THAT IS PRACTICAL FOR THEIR SIZE. FOR EXAMPLE A VERY SHORT CHILD CANNOT PLAY A FULL SIZE DOUBLE BASS BECAUSE THE DOUBLE BASS IS OVER FIVE FEET HIGH. PEOPLE SHOULD CHOOSE AN INSTRUMENT THAT THEY ENJOY PLAYING BECAUSE PLAYING REGULARLY IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET BETTER. FINALLY IT HELPS TO HAVE A GOOD TEACHER.
ANYONE CAN MAKE UP HIS OR HER OWN PIECES OF MUSIC. IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO COMPOSE SIMPLE SONGS OR MELODIES TUNES. IT S EASIER FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN PLAY AN INSTRUMENT THEMSELVES. ALL IT TAKES IS EXPERIMENTING WITH THE SOUNDS THAT AN INSTRUMENT MAKES. SOMEONE CAN MAKE UP A PIECE THAT TELLS A STORY OR JUST FIND A NICE TUNE AND THINK ABOUT WAYS IT CAN BE CHANGED EACH TIME IT IS REPEATED. THE INSTRUMENT MIGHT BE SOMEONE S OWN VOICE.
NAPOLEON
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE. HE WAS THE EMPEROR OF FRANCE AND ALSO THE KING OF ITALY AS NAPOLEON I. HIS ACTIONS SHAPED EUROPEAN POLITICS IN THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY. 
BONAPARTE WAS BORN IN CORSICA. HIS PARENTS WERE OF NOBLE ITALIAN BIRTH. HE TRAINED AS AN OFFICER IN MAINLAND FRANCE. NAPOLEON BECAME IMPORTANT UNDER THE FIRST FRENCH REPUBLIC. HE LED SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGNS AGAINST COALITIONS OF ENEMIES OF THE REVOLUTION. IN 1799 HE STAGED A COUP D TAT TO MAKE HIMSELF FIRST CONSUL. FIVE YEARS LATER THE FRENCH SENATE DECLARED HIM EMPEROR. IN THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE FRENCH EMPIRE UNDER NAPOLEON WAGED THE NAPOLEONIC WARS. EVERY EUROPEAN GREAT POWER JOINED IN THESE WARS. AFTER A NUMBER OF VICTORIES FRANCE BECAME VERY IMPORTANT IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE. NAPOLEON INCREASED HIS POWER BY MAKING MANY ALLIANCES. HE ALSO MADE HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS RULE OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS FRENCH CLIENT STATES.
THE FRENCH INVASION OF RUSSIA IN 1812 BECAME NAPOLEON S FIRST BIG DEFEAT. HIS ARMY WAS BADLY DAMAGED AND NEVER FULLY RECOVERED. IN 1813 ANOTHER COALITION DEFEATED HIS FORCES AT LEIPZIG. THE YEAR AFTER THAT THEY ATTACKED FRANCE. THE COALITION EXILED NAPOLEON TO THE ISLAND OF ELBA. LESS THAN A YEAR LATER HE ESCAPED ELBA AND BRIEFLY BECAME POWERFUL AGAIN. HOWEVER HE WAS DEFEATED AT THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO IN JUNE 1815. NAPOLEON SPENT THE LAST SIX YEARS OF HIS LIFE CONFINED BY THE BRITISH ON THE ISLAND OF SAINT HELENA. A DOCTOR SAID HE DIED OF STOMACH CANCER BUT SOME SCIENTISTS THINK HE WAS POISONED. 
NAPOLEON S CAMPAIGNS ARE STUDIED AT MILITARY SCHOOLS ALL OVER THE WORLD. HE IS REMEMBERED AS A TYRANT BY HIS ENEMIES. HOWEVER HE IS ALSO REMEMBERED FOR CREATING THE NAPOLEONIC CODE.
ALTHOUGH RAISED A CATHOLIC NAPOLEON WAS A DEIST.
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE WAS BORN IN CASA BUONAPARTE IN THE TOWN OF AJACCIO CORSICA ON THE 15TH OF AUGUST 1769. THIS WAS ONE YEAR AFTER THE ISLAND WAS GIVEN TO FRANCE BY THE REPUBLIC OF GENOA. HE WAS THE SECOND OF EIGHT CHILDREN. HE WAS NAMED NAPOLEONE DI BUONAPARTE. HE TOOK HIS FIRST NAME FROM AN UNCLE WHO HAD BEEN KILLED FIGHTING THE FRENCH. HOWEVER HE LATER USED THE MORE FRENCH SOUNDING NAPOL ON BONAPARTE.
THE CORSICAN BUONAPARTES WERE FROM LOWER ITALIAN NOBILITY. THEY HAD COME TO CORSICA IN THE 16TH CENTURY. HIS FATHER NOBILE CARLO BUONAPARTE BECAME CORSICA S REPRESENTATIVE TO THE COURT OF LOUIS XVI IN 1777. THE GREATEST INFLUENCE OF NAPOLEON S CHILDHOOD WAS HIS MOTHER MARIA LETIZIA RAMOLINO. HER FIRM EDUCATION CONTROLLED A WILD CHILD. HE HAD AN OLDER BROTHER JOSEPH. HE ALSO HAD YOUNGER SIBLINGS LUCIEN ELISA LOUIS PAULINE CAROLINE AND J R ME. NAPOLEON WAS BAPTIZED AS A CATHOLIC JUST BEFORE HIS SECOND BIRTHDAY ON 21 JULY 1771 AT AJACCIO CATHEDRAL.
NAPOLEON WAS ABLE TO ENTER THE MILITARY ACADEMY AT BRIENNE IN 1779. HE WAS NINE YEARS OLD WHEN HE ENTERED THE ACADEMY. HE MOVED TO THE PARISIAN COLE ROYALE MILITAIRE IN 1784 AND GRADUATED A YEAR LATER AS A SECOND LIEUTENANT OF ARTILLERY. NAPOLEON WAS ABLE TO SPEND MUCH OF THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS IN CORSICA. THERE HE PLAYED AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICAL AND MILITARY MATTERS. HE CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH THE CORSICAN NATIONALIST PASQUALE PAOLI AND HIS FAMILY WAS FORCED TO FLEE TO MARSEILLE IN 1793.
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION CAUSED MUCH FIGHTING AND DISORDER IN FRANCE. AT TIMES NAPOLEON WAS CONNECTED TO THOSE IN POWER. OTHER TIMES HE WAS IN JAIL. IN THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY WARS HE HELPED THE REPUBLIC AGAINST ROYALISTS WHO SUPPORTED THE FORMER KING OF FRANCE. IN SEPTEMBER 1793 HE ASSUMED COMMAND OF AN ARTILLERY BRIGADE AT THE SIEGE OF TOULON WHERE ROYALIST LEADERS HAD WELCOMED A BRITISH FLEET AND TROOPS. THE BRITISH WERE DRIVEN OUT IN DECEMBER 17 1793 AND BONAPARTE WAS REWARDED WITH PROMOTION TO BRIGADIER GENERAL AND ASSIGNED TO THE FRENCH ARMY IN ITALY IN FEBRUARY 1794.
GENERAL NAPOLEON BONAPARTE WAS LATER APPOINTED BY THE REPUBLIC TO REPEL THE ROYALISTS ON OCTOBER 5 1795. MORE THAN A 1400 ROYALISTS DIED AND THE REST FLED. HE HAD CLEARED THE STREETS WITH A WHIFF OF GRAPESHOT ACCORDING TO THE 19TH CENTURY HISTORIAN THOMAS CARLYLE. HE WAS THEN PROMOTED TO MAJOR GENERAL AND MARKED HIS NAME ON THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 
THE DEFEAT OF THE ROYALIST REBELLIONS ENDED THE THREAT TO THE CONVENTION AND EARNED BONAPARTE SUDDEN FAME WEALTH AND THE PATRONAGE OF THE NEW DIRECTORY. IN MARCH 9 1796 NAPOLEON MARRIED JOSEPHINE DE BEAUHARNAIS A WIDOW OLDER THAN HE WAS AND A VERY UNLIKELY WIFE TO THE FUTURE RULER.
THE CAMPAIGN IN ITALY IS THE FIRST TIME NAPOLEON LED FRANCE TO WAR. LATE IN MARCH 1796 BONAPARTE BEGAN A SERIES OF OPERATIONS TO DIVIDE AND DEFEAT THE AUSTRIAN AND SARDINIAN ARMIES IN ITALY. HE DEFEATED THE SARDINIANS IN APRIL 21 BRINGING SAVOY AND NICE INTO FRANCE. THEN IN A SERIES OF BRILLIANT BATTLES HE WON LOMBARDY FROM THE AUSTRIANS. MANTUA THE LAST LOMBARD STRONGHOLD FELL IN FEBRUARY 1797.
IN MAY 1798 GENERAL NAPOLEON LEFT FOR A CAMPAIGN IN EGYPT. THE FRENCH NEEDED TO THREATEN BRITISH INDIA AND THE FRENCH DIRECTORY WAS CONCERNED THAT NAPOLEON WOULD TAKE CONTROL OF FRANCE. THE FRENCH ARMY UNDER NAPOLEON WON AN OVERWHELMING VICTORY IN THE BATTLE OF PYRAMIDS. BARELY 300 FRENCH SOLDIERS DIED WHILE THOUSANDS OF MAMLUKS AN OLD POWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST WERE KILLED. BUT HIS ARMY WAS WEAKENED BY BUBONIC PLAGUE AND POOR SUPPLIES BECAUSE THE NAVY WAS DEFEATED AT THE BATTLE OF THE NILE. THE EGYPTIAN CAMPAIGN WAS A MILITARY FAILURE BUT A CULTURAL SUCCESS. THE ROSETTA STONE WAS FOUND BY FRENCH ENGINEER CAPTAIN PIERRE FRAN OIS BOUCHARD AND FRENCH SCHOLAR JEAN FRAN OIS CHAMPOLLION WAS ABLE TO READ THE WORDS IN THE STONE. NAPOLEON WENT BACK TO FRANCE BECAUSE OF A CHANGE IN THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT. SOME BELIEVE THAT NAPOLEON SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT HIS SOLDIERS IN EGYPT. NAPOLEON HELPED LEAD THE BRUMAIRE COUP D ETAT OF NOVEMBER 1799.
BONAPARTE RETURNED TO PARIS IN OCTOBER 1799. FRANCE S SITUATION HAD BEEN IMPROVED BY A SERIES OF VICTORIES BUT THE REPUBLIC WAS BANKRUPT AND THE INEFFECTIVE DIRECTORY WAS UNPOPULAR WITH THE FRENCH POPULATION. HE WAS APPROACHED BY ONE OF THE DIRECTORS EMMANUEL JOSEPH SIEY S FOR HIS SUPPORT IN A COUP TO OVERTHROW THE CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT. THE LEADERS OF THE PLOT INCLUDED HIS BROTHER LUCIEN BONAPARTE THE SPEAKER OF THE COUNCIL OF FIVE HUNDRED ROGER DUCOS ANOTHER DIRECTOR JOSEPH FOUCH AND CHARLES MAURICE TALLEYRAND. OTHER DEPUTIES REALISED THEY FACED AN ATTEMPTED COUP. FACED WITH THEIR PROTESTS BONAPARTE LED TROOPS TO SEIZE CONTROL AND DISPERSE THEM WHICH LEFT A RUMP LEGISLATURE TO NAME BONAPARTE SI YES AND DUCOS AS THE THREE PROVISIONAL CONSULS TO ADMINISTER THE GOVERNMENT.
SIEY S EXPECTED TO DOMINATE THE NEW REGIME BUT HE WAS OUTMANEUVERED BY BONAPARTE. NAPOLEON DRAFTED THE CONSTITUTION OF THE YEAR VIII AND SECURED HIS OWN ELECTION AS FIRST CONSUL. THIS MADE BONAPARTE THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN FRANCE AND HE TOOK UP RESIDENCE AT THE TUILERIES.
IN 1800 NAPOLEON ENSURED HIS POWER BY CROSSING THE ALPS AND DEFEATING THE AUSTRIANS AT MARENGO. HE THEN NEGOTIATED A GENERAL EUROPEAN PEACE THAT ESTABLISHED THE RHINE RIVER AS THE EASTERN BORDER OF FRANCE. HE ALSO CONCLUDED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE POPE THE CONCORDAT OF 1801 WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO FRENCH DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY BY ENDING THE QUARREL WITH THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH THAT HAD ARISEN DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 
IN FRANCE THE ADMINISTRATION WAS REORGANIZED THE COURT SYSTEM WAS SIMPLIFIED AND ALL SCHOOLS WERE PUT UNDER CENTRALIZED CONTROL. FRENCH LAW WAS STANDARDIZED IN THE NAPOLEONIC CODE OR CIVIL CODE AND SIX OTHER CODES. THEY GUARANTEED THE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES WON IN THE REVOLUTION INCLUDING EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW AND FREEDOM OF RELIGION.
IN FEBRUARY 1804 A BRITISH FINANCIAL PLOT AGAINST BONAPARTE WAS UNCOVERED BY THE FORMER POLICE MINISTER JOSEPH FOUCHE. IT GAVE NAPOLEON A REASON TO START A HEREDITARY DYNASTY. ON DECEMBER 2 1804 NAPOLEON BONAPARTE CROWNED HIMSELF EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH. THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE DID NOT SEE HIM AS THE MONARCH OF THE OLD REGIME BECAUSE OF HIS HOLDING A ROMAN EMPIRE TITLE. HE INVITED POPE PIUS VII TO SEE HIS CORONATION AT NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL IN PARIS. DURING THE CEREMONY NAPOLEON I TOOK THE CROWN FROM THE POPE S HAND AND PLACED IT ON HIS OWN HEAD. THIS HAD BEEN AGREED ON BETWEEN NAPOLEON AND THE POPE. AT MILAN CATHEDRAL ON MAY 26 1805 NAPOLEON WAS CROWNED KING OF ITALY WITH THE IRON CROWN OF LOMBARDY.
TO RESTORE PROSPERITY NAPOLEON MODERNIZED FINANCE. HE REGULATED THE ECONOMY TO CONTROL PRICES ENCOURAGED NEW INDUSTRY AND BUILT ROADS AND CANALS. TO ENSURE WELL TRAINED OFFICIALS AND MILITARY OFFICERS HE PROMOTED A SYSTEM OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS UNDER FIRM GOVERNMENT CONTROL. HE ALSO REPEALED SOME SOCIAL REFORMS OF THE REVOLUTION. HE MADE PEACE WITH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE CONCORDAT OF 1801. THE CONCORDAT KEPT THE CHURCH UNDER STATE CONTROL BUT RECOGNIZED RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR CATHOLICS.
NAPOLEON I WON SUPPORT ACROSS CLASS LINES. HE ENCOURAGED THE MIGR POPULATION TO RETURN PROVIDED THEY GAVE AN OATH OF LOYALTY. PEASANTS WERE RELIEVED WHEN HE RECOGNIZED THEIR RIGHT TO LANDS THEY HAD BOUGHT DURING THE REVOLUTION. NAPOLEON S CHIEF OPPOSITION CAME FROM ROYALISTS AND REPUBLICANS.
AMONG NAPOLEON S MOST LASTING REFORMS WAS A NEW LAW CODE POPULARLY CALLED THE NAPOLEONIC CODE. IT EMBODIED ENLIGHTENMENT PRINCIPLES SUCH AS EQUALITY OF ALL CITIZENS BEFORE THE LAW RELIGIOUS TOLERATION AND ADVANCEMENT BASED ON VIRTUE. BUT THE NAPOLEONIC CODE UNDID SOME REFORMS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. WOMEN FOR EXAMPLE LOST MOST OF THEIR NEWLY GAINED RIGHTS UNDER THE NEW CODE. THE LAW CONSIDERED WOMEN MINORS WHO COULD NOT EXERCISE THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP. MALE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLDS REGAINED FULL AUTHORITY OVER THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN. AGAIN NAPOLEON VALUED ORDER AND AUTHORITY OVER INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS.
EMPEROR NAPOLEON ABANDONED PLANS TO INVADE ENGLAND AND TURNED HIS ARMIES AGAINST THE AUSTRO RUSSIAN FORCES DEFEATING THEM AT THE BATTLE OF AUSTERLITZ ON DECEMBER 2 1805. IN 1806 NAPOLEON DESTROYED THE PRUSSIAN ARMY AT JENA AND AUERST DT AND THE RUSSIAN ARMY AT FRIEDLAND. HE CROWNED HIS ELDER BROTHER JOSEPH BONAPARTE AS KING OF NAPLES AND SICILY IN 1806 AND CONVERTED THE DUTCH REPUBLIC INTO THE KINGDOM OF HOLLAND FOR HIS BROTHER LOUIS. NAPOLEON ALSO ESTABLISHED THE CONFEDERATION OF THE RHINE MOST OF THE GERMAN STATES OF WHICH HE WAS PROTECTOR.
TO LEGITIMIZE HIS RULE HE DIVORCED HIS WIFE JOS PHINE AND MARRIED MARIE LOUISE DUCHESS OF PARMA AND DAUGHTER OF THE EMPEROR FRANCIS I OF AUSTRIA. SOON SHE DELIVERED A SON AND HEIR TO THE BONAPARTE DYNASTY. HE WAS NAMED NAPOL ON FRAN OIS JOSEPH CHARLES BONAPARTE OR NAPOLEON II AND CROWNED KING OF ROME FROM HIS BIRTH.
AT TILSIT IN JULY 1807 NAPOLEON MADE AN ALLY OF RUSSIAN TSAR ALEXANDER ROMANOV AND GREATLY REDUCED THE SIZE OF PRUSSIA. HE ALSO ADDED NEW STATES TO THE EMPIRE THE KINGDOM OF WESTPHALIA UNDER HIS YOUNGEST BROTHER JEROME THE DUCHY OF WARSAW AND OTHERS STATES.
THE CONGRESS OF ERFURT SOUGHT TO PRESERVE THE RUSSO FRENCH ALLIANCE AND THE LEADERS HAD A FRIENDLY PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP AFTER THEIR FIRST MEETING AT TILSIT IN 1807. HOWEVER IN JUNE 23 1812 NAPOLEON WENT TO WAR WITH RUSSIA. THE FRENCH INVASION OF RUSSIA DEFEATED MANY RUSSIAN CITIES AND VILLAGES BUT BY THE TIME THEY REACHED MOSCOW IT WAS WINTER. DUE TO THE RUSSIAN ARMY S SCORCHED EARTH TACTICS THE FRENCH FOUND LITTLE FOOD FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR HORSES. NAPOLEON S ARMY WAS UNABLE TO DEFEAT THE RUSSIANS. THE RUSSIANS BEGAN TO ATTACK. NAPOLEON AND HIS ARMY HAD TO GO BACK TO FRANCE. THE FRENCH SUFFERED GREATLY IN DURING NAPOLEON S RETREAT. MOST OF HIS SOLDIERS NEVER RETURNED TO FRANCE. HIS ARMY WAS REDUCED TO 70 000 SOLDIERS AND 40 000 STRAGGLERS AGAINST MORE THAN THREE TIMES AS MANY ALLIED TROOPS. FINALLY AT THE 1813 BATTLE OF THE NATIONS HE WAS DEFEATED BY THE ALLIES SWEDEN RUSSIA AUSTRIA AND PRUSSIA.
NAPOLEON HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ABDICATE IN FAVOR OF HIS SON. HOWEVER THE ALLIES REFUSED TO ACCEPT THIS. NAPOLEON ABDICATED WITHOUT CONDITIONS ON APRIL 11 1814. BEFORE HIS OFFICIAL ABDICATION NAPOLEON ATTEMPTED SUICIDE WITH A PILL BUT IT DID NOT WORK. IN THE TREATY OF FONTAINEBLEAU THE VICTORS EXILED HIM TO ELBA AN ISLAND OF 12 000 INHABITANTS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. THE ALLIES ALLOWED NAPOLEON TO KEEP AN IMPERIAL TITLE EMPEROR OF ELBA AND AN ALLOWANCE OF 2 MILLION FRANCS A YEAR. NAPOLEON EVEN REQUESTED A 21 GUN SALUTE AS EMPEROR OF THE ISLAND OF ELBA. MANY DELEGATES FEARED THAT ELBA WAS TOO CLOSE TO EUROPE TO KEEP SUCH A DANGEROUS FORCE.
SEPARATED FROM HIS SON AND WIFE WHO HAD COME UNDER AUSTRIAN CONTROL CUT OFF FROM THE ALLOWANCE GUARANTEED TO HIM BY THE TREATY OF FONTAINEBLEAU AND AWARE OF RUMOURS HE WAS ABOUT TO BE BANISHED TO A REMOTE ISLAND IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN NAPOLEON ESCAPED FROM ELBA ON FEBRUARY 26 1815. HE MADE A SURPRISE MARCH ON MARCH 1 1815 TO PARIS. HIS FORMER TROOPS JOINED HIM AND LOUIS XVIII FLED TO EXILE. HE AGAIN BECAME RULER OF FRANCE FOR A LENGTH OF 100 DAYS. NAPOLEON WAS DEFEATED AT THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO BY THE BRITISH UNDER DUKE OF WELLINGTON AND PRUSSIANS ON JUNE 18 1815 WHICH WAS HIS LAST BATTLE. NAPOLEON WAS AGAIN CAPTURED AND TAKEN TO HIS SECOND EXILE ON THE ISLAND OF SAINT HELENA ON THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.
NAPOLEON WAS SENT TO THE ISLAND OF SAINT HELENA OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA. HE DIED ON MAY 5 1821 OF STOMACH CANCER. NAPOLEON KEPT HIMSELF UP TO DATE OF THE EVENTS THROUGH THE TIMES AND HOPED FOR RELEASE IN THE EVENT THAT HOLLAND BECAME PRIME MINISTER. THERE WERE OTHER PLOTS TO RESCUE NAPOLEON FROM CAPTIVITY INCLUDING ONE FROM TEXAS WHERE EXILED SOLDIERS FROM THE GRANDE ARM E WANTED A RESURRECTION OF THE NAPOLEONIC EMPIRE IN AMERICA. THERE WAS EVEN A PLAN TO RESCUE HIM WITH A PRIMITIVE SUBMARINE. FOR LORD BYRON NAPOLEON WAS THE EPITOME OF THE ROMANTIC HERO THE PERSECUTED LONELY AND FLAWED GENIUS. THE NEWS THAT NAPOLEON HAD TAKEN UP GARDENING AT LONGWOOD ALSO APPEALED TO MORE DOMESTIC BRITISH SENSIBILITIES.
FRENCH PEOPLE REMAIN PROUD OF NAPOLEON S GLORY DAYS. THE NAPOLEONIC CODE REFLECTS THE MODERN FRENCH CONSTITUTION. WEAPONS AND OTHER KINDS OF MILITARY TECHNOLOGY REMAINED LARGELY STATIC THROUGH THE REVOLUTIONARY AND NAPOLEONIC ERAS BUT 18TH CENTURY OPERATIONAL MOBILITY UNDERWENT SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. NAPOLEON S BIGGEST INFLUENCE WAS IN THE CONDUCT OF WARFARE. HIS POPULARITY WOULD LATER HELP HIS NEPHEW LOUIS NAPOL ON TO BECOME RULER OF FRANCE 
ON THE WORLD STAGE NAPOLEON S CONQUEST SPREAD THE IDEAS OF THE REVOLUTION. HE FAILED TO MAKE EUROPE INTO A FRENCH EMPIRE. INSTEAD HE SPARKED NATIONALIST FEELING ACROSS EUROPE.
NATURAL SATELLITE
A NATURAL SATELLITE IN ASTRONOMY IS A SMALLER BODY WHICH MOVES AROUND A LARGER BODY. THE SMALLER BODY IS HELD IN ORBIT BY GRAVITATION. THE TERM IS USED FOR MOONS WHICH GO AROUND PLANETS AND IT IS ALSO USED FOR SMALL GALAXIES WHICH ORBIT LARGER GALAXIES.
BODIES WHICH ORBIT PLANETS ARE CALLED MOONS. THEY VARY IN SIZE AND ARE BALL SHAPED. THE EARTH HAS ONLY ONE MOON. SOME OTHER PLANETS HAVE MANY MOONS AND SOME HAVE NONE. WHEN PEOPLE WRITE JUST THE MOON THEY ARE USUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE MOON OF THE EARTH. EARTH S MOON IS WRITTEN WITH A CAPITAL LETTER MOON. THE LATIN WORD FOR THE MOON IS LUNA WHICH IS WHY THE ADJECTIVE USED TO TALK ABOUT THE MOON IS LUNAR. FOR EXAMPLE LUNAR ECLIPSE.
ANYTHING THAT GOES AROUND A PLANET IS CALLED A SATELLITE. MOONS ARE NATURAL SATELLITES. PEOPLE ALSO USE ROCKETS TO SEND MACHINES INTO ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH. THESE MACHINES ARE CALLED ARTIFICIAL MAN MADE SATELLITES.
MOONS DO NOT MAKE THEIR OWN LIGHT. WE CAN SEE THE EARTH S MOON BECAUSE IT ACTS LIKE A MIRROR AND REFLECTS THE LIGHT OF THE SUN. THE SAME HALF OF THE MOON FACES TOWARD EARTH AT ALL TIMES NO MATTER WHERE IT MOVES. BUT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MOON ARE LIT UP BY THE SUN SO IT LOOKS DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE MONTH. THIS CHANGE AS SEEN FROM EARTH IS CALLED THE PHASES OF THE MOON OR LUNAR PHASES.
A MOON S CYCLE IS THE TIME THE MOON TAKES TO CHANGE FROM LOOKING VERY BRIGHT AND ROUND TO LOOKING VERY SMALL AND THIN AND THEN BACK TO BRIGHT AND ROUND AGAIN. IN THE CASE OF THE EARTH S MOON THIS IS ABOUT FOUR WEEKS. IT DOES THIS ABOUT 13 TIMES IN ONE YEAR. THE MOON S CYCLE IS ABOUT 28 DAYS A BIT SHORTER THAN A CALENDAR MONTH.
THE APOLLO 11 MISSION HELPED NEIL ARMSTRONG AND BUZZ ALDRIN BECOME THE FIRST PEOPLE TO WALK ON THE MOON. THEY DID THIS ON JULY 20 1969.
THE ORBIT OF A MOON OR OTHER SATELLITE IS AFFECTED BY TWO FORCES GRAVITY AND THE CENTRIPETAL FORCE.
FOR EXAMPLE THE EARTH S MOON IS KEPT IN ORBIT BY THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL FROM THE EARTH. THIS IS ALSO THE WAY THE EARTH IS ATTRACTED TO THE SUN AND STAYS IN ITS ORBIT. THE ORBIT OF THE EARTH S MOON ACTUALLY CAUSES THE TIDES AND WAVES ON EARTH.
NO MOONS THAT BELONG TO MOONS HAVE BEEN FOUND. IN MOST CASES THE TIDAL EFFECTS OF THE MAIN BODY WOULD MAKE SUCH AS UNSTABLE.
HOWEVER MATH COMPLETED AFTER THE RECENT FINDING OF A POSSIBLE RING SYSTEM AROUND SATURN S MOON RHEA SHOW THAT RHEAN ORBITS WOULD BE STABLE. ALSO THE RINGS ARE THOUGHT TO BE NARROW SOMETHING THAT IS KNOWN WITH SHEPHERD MOONS.
THE FINDING OF 243 IDA S MOON DACTYL IN THE EARLY 1990S WAS THE PROOF THAT SOME ASTEROIDS HAVE MOONS INDEED 87 SYLVIA HAS TWO. SOME SUCH AS 90 ANTIOPE ARE DOUBLE ASTEROIDS WITH TWO SAME SIZED PARTS.
THE BIGGEST MOONS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM THOSE BIGGER THAN ABOUT 3000 KM ACROSS ARE EARTH S MOON JUPITER S GALILEAN MOONS IO EUROPA GANYMEDE AND CALLISTO SATURN S MOON TITAN AND NEPTUNE S CAPTURED MOON TRITON.
THE FOLLOWING IS A TABLE GROUPING THE MOONS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM BY DIAMETER. THE COLUMN ON THE RIGHT HAS SOME NOTABLE PLANETS DWARF PLANETS ASTEROIDS AND TRANS NEPTUNIAN OBJECTS FOR COMPARING. IT IS NORMAL FOR MOONS TO BE NAMED AFTER PEOPLE FROM MYTHOLOGY.
PLANETS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM THAT HAVE MOON S 
PLANETS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM THAT DO NOT HAVE MOONS 
GALAXIES ARE FOUND IN GROUPS CALLED GALAXY CLUSTERS WHICH ARE ALSO HELD TOGETHER BY GRAVITATION. OUR OWN MILKY WAY IS THE SECOND LARGEST GALAXY IN OUR LOCAL GROUP THE LARGEST IS ANDROMEDA. MANY SMALLER GALAXIES AND STAR CLUSTERS ARE ALSO HELD IN THE LOCAL GROUP OUTSIDE THE TWO MAIN GALAXIES. THEY ARE ALL IN ORBITS ROUND ONE OF THE CENTRES OF GRAVITY. THAT MEANS MOST OF THEM MOVE ROUND EITHER ANDROMEDA OR THE MILKY WAY. SO IT SEEMS NATURAL FOR ASTRONOMERS TO USE THE TERM SATELLITE FOR THESE AS WELL.
OUR LOCAL GROUP IS ITSELF PART OF AN EVEN LARGER GROUP THE VIRGO SUPERCLUSTER. THERE ARE OTHER EVEN LARGER GROUPS OF GALAXIES SEE THE GREAT WALL FOR AN EXAMPLE.

A NOUN IS A KIND OF WORD SEE PART OF SPEECH THAT IS USUALLY THE NAME OF SOMETHING SUCH AS A PERSON PLACE THING QUALITY OR IDEA. IN ENGLISH NOUNS CAN BE SINGULAR OR PLURAL.
NOUNS OFTEN NEED A WORD CALLED AN ARTICLE OR LIKE THE OR THAT. THESE WORDS USUALLY DO NOT GO WITH OTHER KINDS OF WORDS LIKE VERBS OR ADVERBS. FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE DO NOT ALSO DESCRIBE NOUNS. IN ENGLISH THERE ARE MORE NOUNS THAN ANY OTHER KIND OF WORD.
EVERY LANGUAGE IN THE WORLD HAS NOUNS BUT THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS USED IN THE SAME WAYS. THEY ALSO CAN HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME OTHER LANGUAGES NOUNS DO NOT CHANGE FOR SINGULAR AND PLURAL AND SOMETIMES THERE IS NO WORD FOR THE.
EXAMPLES OF NOUNS TIME PEOPLE WAY YEAR GOVERNMENT DAY WORLD LIFE WORK PART NUMBER HOUSE SYSTEM COMPANY END PARTY INFORMATION.
THE WORD NOUN COMES FROM THE LATIN NOMEN MEANING NAME. WORDS LIKE NOUNS WERE DESCRIBED IN EARLY DAYS BY THE SANSKRIT GRAMMARIAN AND ANCIENT GREEKS LIKE DIONYSIOS THRAX.
IN ENGLISH SENTENCES NOUNS CAN BE USED AS A SUBJECT OBJECT OR COMPLEMENT. THEY OFTEN COME AFTER PREPOSITIONS AS THE OBJECT OF PREPOSITION.
NOUNS CAN SOMETIMES DESCRIBE OTHER NOUNS SUCH AS A SOCCER BALL. WHEN THEY DO THIS THEY ARE CALLED MODIFIERS OR ADJUNCTS.
THERE ARE ALSO VERB FORMS THAT CAN BE USED IN THE SAME WAY AS NOUNS SUCH AS I LIKE RUNNING. THESE ARE CALLED VERBALS OR VERBAL NOUNS AND INCLUDE PARTICIPLES WHICH CAN ALSO BE ADJECTIVES AND INFINITIVES.
NOUNS ARE CLASSIFIED INTO COMMON AND PROPER. PRONOUNS HAVE COMMONLY BEEN CONSIDERED A DIFFERENT PART OF SPEECH FROM NOUNS BUT IN THE PAST SOME GRAMMARS HAVE INCLUDED THEM AS NOUNS AS DO MANY MODERN LINGUISTS.
PROPER NOUNS ALSO CALLED PROPER NAME ARE SPECIFIC NAMES. EXAMPLES OF PROPER NOUNS ARE LONDON JOHN GOD OCTOBER MOZART SATURDAY COKE MR. BROWN ATLANTIC OCEAN. 
PROPER NOUNS BEGIN WITH AN CAPITAL LETTER IN ENGLISH AND MANY OTHER LANGUAGES THAT USE THE ROMAN ALPHABET. HOWEVER IN GERMAN ALL NOUNS BEGIN WITH AN UPPER CASE LETTER. THE WORD I IS REALLY A PRONOUN ALTHOUGH IT IS CAPITALIZED IN ENGLISH LIKE A PROPER NOUN.
SOME COMMON NOUNS SEE BELOW CAN ALSO BE USED AS PROPER NOUNS. FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE MIGHT BE NAMED TIGER SMITH EVEN THOUGH HE IS NOT A TIGER OR A SMITH.
COMMON NOUNS ARE GENERAL NAMES. SOMETIMES THE SAME WORD CAN BE EITHER A COMMON NOUN OR A PROPER NOUN DEPENDING ON HOW IT IS USED FOR EXAMPLE 
IN ENGLISH AND MANY OTHER LANGUAGES NOUNS HAVE NUMBER. BUT SOME NOUNS ARE ONLY SINGULAR SUCH AS FURNITURE PHYSICS AND OTHERS ARE ONLY PLURAL SUCH AS CLOTHES POLICE. ALSO SOME NOUNS ARE COUNTABLE FOR EXAMPLE ONE PIECE TWO PIECES BUT OTHERS ARE UNCOUNTABLE FOR EXAMPLE WE DO NOT SAY ONE FURNITURE TWO FURNITURES.
THE PLURAL FORM OF MOST NOUNS IS CREATED SIMPLY BY ADDING THE LETTER S.
NOTE THAT SOME DICTIONARIES LIST BUSSES AS AN ACCEPTABLE PLURAL FOR BUS. PRESUMABLY THIS IS BECAUSE THE PLURAL BUSES LOOKS LIKE IT OUGHT TO RHYME WITH THE PLURAL OF FUSE WHICH IS FUSES. BUSES IS STILL LISTED AS THE PREFERABLE PLURAL FORM. BUSSES IS THE PLURAL OF COURSE FOR BUSS A SELDOM USED WORD FOR KISS. 
THERE ARE SEVERAL NOUNS THAT HAVE IRREGULAR PLURAL FORMS. PLURALS FORMED IN THIS WAY ARE SOMETIMES CALLED MUTATED OR MUTATING PLURALS.
AND FINALLY THERE ARE NOUNS THAT MAINTAIN THEIR LATIN OR GREEK FORM IN THE PLURAL. SEE MEDIA AND DATA AND ALUMNI BELOW. 
NOUNS ARE WORDS FOR THINGS AND SINCE THINGS CAN BE POSSESSED NOUNS CAN ALSO CHANGE TO SHOW POSSESSION IN GRAMMAR. IN ENGLISH WE USUALLY ADD AN APOSTROPHE AND AN S TO NOUNS TO MAKE THEM POSSESSIVE OR SOMETIMES JUST AN APOSTROPHE WHEN THERE IS ALREADY AN S AT THE END LIKE THIS 
MOST ADJECTIVES BECOME NOUNS BY ADDING THE SUFFIX NESS. EXAMPLE TAKE THE ADJECTIVE NATURAL ADD NESS TO GET NATURALNESS A NOUN. TO SEE A LIST OF 100 ADJECTIVES USED IN BASIC ENGLISH CLICK HERE
OLYMPIC GAMES
THE OLYMPIC GAMES ARE AN IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL EVENT FEATURING SUMMER AND WINTER SPORTS. SUMMER OLYMPIC GAMES AND WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES ARE HELD EVERY FOUR YEARS. ORIGINALLY THE ANCIENT OLYMPIC GAMES WERE HELD IN ANCIENT GREECE AT OLYMPIA. THE FIRST GAMES WERE IN 776 BC. THEY WERE HELD EVERY FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE 5TH CENTURY AD. THE FIRST MODERN OLYMPICS HAPPENED IN 1896 IN ATHENS GREECE. ATHLETES PARTICIPATE IN THE OLYMPICS GAMES TO REPRESENT THEIR COUNTRY.
OVER TIME THE OLYMPICS HAVE BECOME BIGGER. IN OLD TIMES WOMEN WERE NOT ALLOWED BUT NOW THERE ARE WOMEN S EVENTS. THE WINTER GAMES WERE CREATED FOR ICE AND SNOW SPORTS. THE PARALYMPIC GAMES WERE CREATED FOR ATHLETES WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES. AS WELL THE OLYMPICS BECAME BIGGER WITH THE ADDITION OF THE YOUTH OLYMPIC GAMES FOR TEENAGE ATHLETES. WORLD WAR I AND WORLD WAR II LED TO THE CANCELLATION OF THE 1916 1940 AND 1944 GAMES. AS THE DECISION MAKING BODY THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE IOC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING THE HOST CITY FOR EACH OLYMPIC GAMES. THE IOC IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING WHAT SPORTS ARE IN THE GAMES.
THE CELEBRATION OF THE GAMES INCLUDES MANY RITUALS AND SYMBOLS SUCH AS OLYMPIC FLAG AND TORCH AS WELL AS THE OPENING AND CLOSING CEREMONIES. THE FIRST SECOND AND THIRD PLACE FINISHERS IN EACH EVENT RECEIVE RESPECTIVELY GOLD SILVER AND BRONZE MEDALS.
THE OLYMPICS OF ANCIENT GREECE FEATURED MAINLY ATHLETIC BUT ALSO COMBAT AND CHARIOT RACING EVENTS. DURING THE OLYMPIC GAMES ALL STRUGGLES AMONG THE PARTICIPATING CITY STATES WERE POSTPONED UNTIL THE GAMES WERE FINISHED. THE ORIGIN OF THESE OLYMPICS IS SHROUDED IN MYSTERY AND LEGEND ACCORDING TO LEGEND IT WAS HERACLES WHO FIRST CALLED THE GAMES OLYMPIC AND ESTABLISHED THE CUSTOM OF HOLDING THEM EVERY FOUR YEARS. THE MOST WIDELY ACCEPTED DATE FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE ANCIENT OLYMPICS IS 776BC BASED ON INSCRIPTIONS OF THE WINNERS OF A FOOTRACE HELD EVERY FOUR YEARS STARTING THEN. THE ANCIENT GAMES FEATURED RUNNING EVENTS A PENTATHLON CONSISTING OF A JUMPING EVENT DISCUS AND JAVELIN THROWS A FOOT RACE AND WRESTLING BOXING WRESTLING AND EQUESTRIAN EVENTS.
THERE IS NO AGREEMENT ON WHEN THE GAMES OFFICIALLY ENDED BUT MANY HISTORIANS THINK IT IS 393AD WHEN THE EMPEROR THEODOSIUS I DECLARED THAT ALL PAGAN RELIGIOUS PRACTICES SHOULD END. ANOTHER DATE MIGHT BE 426AD WHEN THE NEXT EMPEROR THEODOSIUS II ORDERED THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL GREEK TEMPLES. AFTER THE OLYMPICS STOPPED THEY WERE NOT HELD AGAIN UNTIL THE LATE 19TH CENTURY.
AN ATTEMPT TO COPY THE ANCIENT OLYMPIC GAMES WAS THE L OLYMPIADE DE LA R PUBLIQUE A NATIONAL OLYMPIC FESTIVAL HELD ANNUALLY FROM 1796 TO 1798 IN REVOLUTIONARY FRANCE. THE COMPETITION HAD SEVERAL SPORTS FROM THE ANCIENT GREEK OLYMPICS.
GREEK INTEREST IN BRINGING BACK THE OLYMPIC GAMES BEGAN WITH THE GREEK WAR OF INDEPENDENCE FROM THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE IN 1821. IT WAS FIRST PROPOSED BY POET AND NEWSPAPER EDITOR PANAGIOTIS SOUTSOS IN HIS POEM DIALOGUE OF THE DEAD PUBLISHED IN 1833. EVANGELIS ZAPPAS A WEALTHY GREEK ROMANIAN PHILANTHROPIST FIRST WROTE TO KING OTTO OF GREECE IN 1856 OFFERING TO FUND A PERMANENT REVIVAL OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES. ZAPPAS SPONSORED THE FIRST OLYMPIC GAMES IN 1859 WHICH WAS HELD IN ATHENS. ATHLETES FROM GREECE AND THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE PARTICIPATED. ZAPPAS FUNDED THE RESTORATION OF THE ANCIENT PANATHENAIC STADIUM SO THAT IT COULD HOST ALL FUTURE OLYMPIC GAMES.
BETWEEN 1862 AND 1867 LIVERPOOL HELD AN ANNUAL GRAND OLYMPIC FESTIVAL. IT WAS CREATED BY JOHN HULLEY AND CHARLES MELLY WITH SUPPORT FROM DR. BROOKES. THESE GAMES WERE UNFAIR IN NATURE SINCE ONLY MEN COULD COMPETE. IN 1865 HULLEY DR. BROOKES AND E.G. RAVENSTEIN FOUNDED THE NATIONAL OLYMPIAN ASSOCIATION IN LIVERPOOL A FORERUNNER OF THE BRITISH OLYMPIC ASSOCIATION. ITS ARTICLES OF FOUNDATION PROVIDED THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC CHARTER.
DR. BROOKES COPIED THE SPORTS WHICH WERE IN THE OLYMPICS HELD IN ATHENS IN 1859 IN FUTURE WENLOCK OLYMPIAN GAMES BROOKES CREATED THIS FIRST AS A CLASS IN 1850 AND THEN AS AN EVENT IN 1856.. IN 1866 A NATIONAL OLYMPIC GAMES IN GREAT BRITAIN WAS ORGANIZED BY DR. BROOKES AT LONDON S CRYSTAL PALACE.
THE PANATHINAIKO STADIUM HOSTED OLYMPICS IN 1870 AND 1875. THIRTY THOUSAND SPECTATORS ATTENDED THAT GAMES IN 1870 ALTHOUGH NO OFFICIAL ATTENDANCE RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE 1875 GAMES. IN 1890 AFTER ATTENDING THE OLYMPIAN GAMES OF THE WENLOCK OLYMPIAN SOCIETY BARON PIERRE DE COUBERTIN CREATED THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE. COUBERTIN BUILT ON THE IDEAS AND WORK OF BROOKES AND ZAPPAS WITH THE AIM OF CREATING AN OLYMPIC GAMES THAT WOULD OCCUR EVERY FOUR YEARS IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY. HE PRESENTED THESE IDEAS DURING THE FIRST MEETING OF THE NEWLY CREATED INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE IOC. THIS MEETING WAS HELD FROM JUNE 16 TO JUNE 23 1894 AT THE SORBONNE UNIVERSITY IN PARIS. ON THE LAST DAY OF THE MEETING IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE FIRST OLYMPIC GAMES TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE IOC WOULD TAKE PLACE TWO YEARS LATER IN ATHENS. THE IOC ELECTED THE GREEK WRITER DEMETRIUS VIKELAS AS ITS FIRST PRESIDENT.
THE FIRST GAMES HELD UNDER THE IOC WAS HOSTED IN THE PANATHENAIC STADIUM IN ATHENS IN 1896. THESE GAMES BROUGHT 14 NATIONS AND 241 ATHLETES WHO COMPETED IN 43 EVENTS. ZAPPAS AND HIS COUSIN KONSTANTINOS ZAPPAS HAD LEFT THE GREEK GOVERNMENT MONEY TO FUND FUTURE OLYMPIC GAMES. THIS MONEY WAS USED TO PAY FOR THE 1896 GAMES. GEORGE AVEROFF PAID FOR THE REFURBISHMENT OF THE STADIUM IN PREPARATION FOR THE GAMES. THE GREEK GOVERNMENT ALSO PROVIDED MONEY WHICH WAS PAID BACK THROUGH THE SALE OF TICKETS. MONEY WAS ALSO PAID BACK THROUGH THE SALE OF THE FIRST OLYMPIC COMMEMORATIVE STAMP SET.
THE GREEK OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC WERE EXCITED ABOUT HOSTING THESE GAMES. THIS FEELING WAS SHARED BY MANY OF THE ATHLETES WHO EVEN DEMANDED THAT ATHENS BE THE HOST OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES ON A PERMANENT BASIS. THE IOC DID NOT APPROVE THIS REQUEST. THE IOC STATED THAT EACH GAMES WOULD BE HELD IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY.
FOLLOWING THE SUCCESS OF THE 1896 GAMES THE OLYMPICS ENTERED A PERIOD OF STAGNATION THAT THREATENED THEIR SURVIVAL. THE OLYMPIC GAMES HELD AT THE PARIS EXPOSITION IN 1900 AND THE WORLD S FAIR AT ST. LOUIS IN 1904 WERE SIDE SHOWS. THE GAMES AT PARIS DID NOT HAVE A STADIUM HOWEVER THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME WOMEN TOOK PART IN THE GAMES. THE ST. LOUIS GAMES HOSTED 650 ATHLETES BUT 580 WERE FROM THE UNITED STATES. THE HOMOGENEOUS NATURE OF THESE CELEBRATIONS WAS A LOW POINT FOR THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT. THE GAMES REBOUNDED WHEN THE INTERCALATED GAMES SO CALLED BECAUSE THEY WERE THE SECOND GAMES HELD WITHIN AN OLYMPIAD A PERIOD OF TIME LASTING FOUR YEARS WERE HELD IN ATHENS. THESE GAMES ARE NOT OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED BY THE IOC AND NO INTERCALATED GAMES HAVE BEEN HELD SINCE. THESE GAMES WERE HOSTED AT THE PANATHENAIC STADIUM IN ATHENS. THE GAMES ATTRACTED AN INTERNATIONAL FIELD OF PARTICIPANTS AND GENERATED GREAT PUBLIC INTEREST.
THE WINTER OLYMPICS WERE CREATED FOR SNOW AND ICE SPORTS THAT WERE NOT PART OF THE SUMMER GAMES. FIGURE SKATING IN 1908 AND 1920 AND ICE HOCKEY IN 1920 WERE OLYMPIC EVENTS AT THE SUMMER OLYMPICS. AT THE 1921 OLYMPIC CONGRESS IN LAUSANNE IT WAS DECIDED TO HOLD A WINTER VERSION OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES. A WINTER SPORTS WEEK ACTUALLY 11 DAYS WAS HELD IN 1924 IN CHAMONIX FRANCE. THE IOC RULED THAT THE WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES BE CELEBRATED EVERY FOUR YEARS ON THE SAME YEAR AS THE SUMMER GAMES. THIS PATTERN CONTINUED UNTIL THE 1992 GAMES IN ALBERTVILLE FRANCE. AFTER THIS BEGINNING WITH THE 1994 GAMES THE WINTER OLYMPICS WERE HELD ON THE THIRD YEAR OF EACH OLYMPIAD.
STARTING IN 2010 YOUTH GAMES HELP TO DEVELOP YOUNG ATHLETES FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES. ATHLETES BETWEEN THE AGES OF 14 AND 18 COMPETE. THE YOUTH OLYMPIC GAMES WERE CREATED BY IOC PRESIDENT JACQUES ROGGE IN 2001 AND APPROVED DURING THE 119TH MEETING OF THE IOC. THE FIRST SUMMER YOUTH GAMES WERE HELD IN SINGAPORE FROM 14 26 AUGUST 2010. THE FIRST WINTER GAMES WAS HOSTED IN INNSBRUCK AUSTRIA IN 2012. THESE GAMES ARE SHORTER THAN THE OLYMPIC GAMES. THE SUMMER VERSION WILL LAST TWELVE DAYS AND THE WINTER VERSION WILL LAST NINE DAYS. THE IOC WILL ALLOW 3 500 ATHLETES AND 875 OFFICIALS TO TAKE PART AT THE SUMMER YOUTH GAMES. 970 ATHLETES AND 580 OFFICIALS WILL TAKE PART AT THE WINTER YOUTH GAMES. THE SPORTS TO BE PLAYED WILL BE THE SAME AS AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES.
THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT INCLUDES A LARGE NUMBER OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SPORTING ORGANIZATIONS AND FEDERATIONS. AS THE GROUP IN CHARGE OF THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE IOC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SELECTING THE HOST CITY. OVERSEEING THE PLANNING OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES. CHANGING THE SPORTS INVOLVED. AGREEING SPONSORSHIP AND BROADCASTING RIGHTS. 
THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT IS MADE OF THREE MAJOR ELEMENTS 
FRENCH AND ENGLISH ARE THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES OF THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT. THE OTHER LANGUAGE USED AT EACH OLYMPIC GAMES IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE HOST COUNTRY.
IN 1998 IT WAS UNCOVERED THAT SEVERAL IOC MEMBERS HAD TAKEN BRIBES FROM MEMBERS OF THE SALT LAKE CITY BID COMMITTEE FOR THE HOSTING OF THE 2002 WINTER OLYMPICS. THIS WAS DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT SALT LAKE CITY WON. THE IOC INVESTIGATED AND FOUR MEMBERS RESIGNED AND SIX PEOPLE WERE SACKED. 
A BBC DOCUMENTARY ENTITLED PANORAMA BUYING THE GAMES AIRED IN AUGUST 2004 INVESTIGATED THE TAKING OF BRIBES IN THE BIDDING PROCESS FOR THE 2012 SUMMER OLYMPICS. THE DOCUMENTARY CLAIMED IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BRIBE IOC MEMBERS INTO VOTING FOR A PARTICULAR CANDIDATE CITY. AFTER BEING NARROWLY DEFEATED IN THEIR BID FOR THE 2012 SUMMER GAMES PARISIAN MAYOR BERTRAND DELANO ACCUSED THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR AND THE LONDON BID COMMITTEE OF BREAKING THE BID RULES.
THE TURIN BID FOR THE 2006 WINTER OLYMPICS WAS ALSO SHROUDED IN CONTROVERSY. A PROMINENT IOC MEMBER MARC HODLER STRONGLY CONNECTED WITH THE RIVAL BID OF SION SWITZERLAND ALLEGED BRIBERY OF IOC OFFICIALS BY MEMBERS OF THE TURIN ORGANIZING COMMITTEE. THESE ACCUSATIONS LED TO A WIDE RANGING INVESTIGATION. THE ALLEGATIONS ALSO SERVED TO SOUR MANY IOC MEMBERS AGAINST SION S BID AND POTENTIALLY HELPED TURIN TO CAPTURE THE HOST CITY NOMINATION.
THE OLYMPIC LOGO ALSO KNOWN AS THE OLYMPIC RINGS CONSISTS OF FIVE INTERTWINED RINGS AND REPRESENTS THE UNITY OF THE FIVE INHABITED CONTINENTS AMERICA AFRICA ASIA AUSTRALIA EUROPE. THE COLORED VERSION OF THE RINGS BLUE YELLOW BLACK GREEN AND RED OVER A WHITE FIELD FORMS THE OLYMPIC FLAG. THE FLAG WAS ADOPTED IN 1914 BUT FLOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE 1920 SUMMER OLYMPICS IN ANTWERP BELGIUM. THE FLAG HAS SINCE BEEN FLOWN DURING EVERY GAMES. THE OLYMPIC MOTTO IS CITIUS ALTIUS FORTIUS A LATIN EXPRESSION MEANING FASTER HIGHER STRONGER.
BEFORE EACH GAMES THE OLYMPIC FLAME IS LIT IN OLYMPIA IN A CEREMONY THAT REFLECTS ANCIENT GREEK RITUALS. A FEMALE PERFORMER ACTING AS A PRIESTESS LIGHTS A TORCH WITH THE USE OF THE SUN. THE WOMAN THEN LIGHTS THE TORCH OF THE FIRST RELAY BEARER. STARTING THE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY THAT WILL CARRY THE FLAME TO THE HOST CITY S OLYMPIC STADIUM. THE FLAME HAS BEEN AN OLYMPIC SYMBOL SINCE 1928 AND THE TORCH RELAY WAS INTRODUCED AT THE 1936 SUMMER GAMES.
THE OLYMPIC MASCOT WAS INTRODUCED IN 1968. THE MASCOT IS EITHER AN ANIMAL OR HUMAN FIGURE REPRESENTING THE CULTURAL HERITAGE OF THE HOST COUNTRY.
AS MANDATED BY THE OLYMPIC CHARTER VARIOUS ELEMENTS FRAME THE OPENING CEREMONY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES. MOST OF THESE RITUALS WERE ESTABLISHED AT THE 1920 SUMMER OLYMPICS IN ANTWERP. THE CEREMONY TYPICALLY STARTS WITH THE HOISTING OF THE HOST COUNTRY S FLAG AND A PERFORMANCE OF ITS NATIONAL ANTHEM. THE HOST NATION THEN PRESENTS ARTISTIC DISPLAYS OF MUSIC SINGING DANCE AND THEATER REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS CULTURE. 
AFTER THE ARTISTIC PORTION OF THE CEREMONY THE ATHLETES PARADE INTO THE STADIUM GROUPED BY NATION. GREECE IS TRADITIONALLY THE FIRST NATION TO ENTER IN ORDER TO HONOR THE ORIGINS OF THE OLYMPICS. NATIONS THEN ENTER THE STADIUM ALPHABETICALLY ACCORDING TO THE HOST COUNTRY S CHOSEN LANGUAGE. THE HOST COUNTRY S ATHLETES ARE ALWAYS THE LAST TO ENTER. DURING THE 2004 SUMMER OLYMPICS WHICH WAS HOSTED IN ATHENS GREECE. THE GREEK FLAG ENTERED THE STADIUM FIRST AND LAST. WHEN IT CAME IN TO THE STADIUM FOR THE SECOND TIME IT WAS FOLLOWED BY THE ATHLETES. SPEECHES ARE THEN GIVEN FORMALLY OPENING THE GAMES. FINALLY THE ATHLETES OATH SAID. FOLLOWING THIS THE OLYMPIC TORCH IS BROUGHT INTO THE STADIUM AND PASSED ON UNTIL IT REACHES THE FINAL TORCH CARRIER WHO LIGHTS THE CAULDRON.
THE CLOSING CEREMONY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES TAKES PLACE AFTER ALL SPORTING EVENTS HAVE CONCLUDED. FLAG BEARERS FROM EACH PARTICIPATING COUNTRY ENTER THE STADIUM. THEY ARE FOLLOWED BY THE ATHLETES WHO ENTER TOGETHER WITHOUT ANY NATIONAL DISTINCTION.
THREE NATIONAL FLAGS ARE HOISTED WHILE THE CORRESPONDING NATIONAL ANTHEMS ARE PLAYED. THE FLAG OF GREECE TO HONOR THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES. THE FLAG OF THE CURRENT HOST COUNTRY. THE FLAG OF THE COUNTRY HOSTING THE NEXT SUMMER OR WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES IS ALSO FLOWN. 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE ORGANIZING COMMITTEE AND THE IOC PRESIDENT MAKE THEIR CLOSING SPEECHES. THE GAMES ARE OFFICIALLY CLOSED AND THE OLYMPIC FLAME IS PUT OUT. 
IN WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE ANTWERP CEREMONY AS THIS TRADITION WAS STARTED IN ANTWERP THE MAYOR OF THE CITY THAT ORGANIZED THE GAMES TRANSFERS A SPECIAL OLYMPIC FLAG TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE IOC. THE PRESIDENT THEN PASSES IT ON TO THE MAYOR OF THE CITY HOSTING THE NEXT OLYMPIC GAMES. 
AFTER THESE COMPULSORY ELEMENTS THE NEXT HOST NATION BRIEFLY INTRODUCES ITSELF WITH ARTISTIC DISPLAYS OF DANCE AND THEATER REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS CULTURE.
A MEDAL CEREMONY IS HELD AFTER EACH OLYMPIC EVENT IS CONCLUDED. THE WINNER SECOND AND THIRD PLACE COMPETITORS OR TEAMS STAND ON TOP OF A THREE TIERED ROSTRUM TO BE AWARDED THEIR RESPECTIVE MEDALS. AFTER THE MEDALS ARE GIVEN OUT BY AN IOC MEMBER THE NATIONAL FLAGS OF THE THREE MEDALISTS ARE RAISED WHILE THE NATIONAL ANTHEM OF THE GOLD MEDALIST S COUNTRY PLAYS.
THE OLYMPIC GAMES PROGRAM CONSISTS OF 26 SPORTS 30 DISCIPLINES AND NEARLY 300 EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE WRESTLING IS A SUMMER OLYMPIC SPORT COMPRISING TWO DISCIPLINES GRECO ROMAN AND FREESTYLE. IT IS BROKEN DOWN INTO FOURTEEN EVENTS FOR MEN AND FOUR EVENTS FOR WOMEN. EACH EVENT REPRESENTS A DIFFERENT WEIGHT CLASS. THE SUMMER OLYMPICS PROGRAM INCLUDES 26 SPORTS WHILE THE WINTER OLYMPICS PROGRAM FEATURES 15 SPORTS. 
OLYMPIC SPORTS ARE GOVERNED BY INTERNATIONAL SPORTS FEDERATIONS IFS RECOGNIZED BY THE IOC AS THE GLOBAL SUPERVISORS OF THOSE SPORTS. THERE ARE 35 FEDERATIONS REPRESENTED AT THE IOC. CHANGES CAN HAPPEN TO THE LIST OF SPORTS IN THE OLYMPICS. SPORTS CAN BE ADDED OR REMOVED FROM THE LIST ON THE BASIS OF A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE IOC. 
THE 114TH IOC MEETING IN 2002 LIMITED THE SUMMER GAMES PROGRAM TO A MAXIMUM OF 28 SPORTS 301 EVENTS AND 10 500 ATHLETES. THREE YEARS LATER AT THE 117TH IOC SESSION THE FIRST MAJOR CHANGE TO THE LIST WAS PERFORMED. THIS RESULTED IN THE REMOVAL OF BASEBALL AND SOFTBALL FROM THE LIST OF SPORTS FOR THE 2012 LONDON GAMES. SINCE THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT IN THE PROMOTION OF TWO OTHER SPORTS THE 2012 PROGRAM WILL FEATURE JUST 26 SPORTS. THE 2016 AND 2020 GAMES WILL RETURN TO THE MAXIMUM OF 28 SPORTS GIVEN THE ADDITION OF RUGBY AND GOLF.
THE EXCLUSION OF PROFESSIONALS CAUSED SEVERAL CONTROVERSIES THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF THE MODERN OLYMPICS. THE 1912 OLYMPIC PENTATHLON AND DECATHLON CHAMPION JIM THORPE WAS STRIPPED OF HIS MEDALS WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD PLAYED SEMI PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL BEFORE THE OLYMPICS. HIS MEDALS WERE RESTORED BY THE IOC IN 1983 ON COMPASSIONATE GROUNDS. AS CLASS STRUCTURE EVOLVED THROUGH THE 20TH CENTURY THE DEFINITION OF THE AMATEUR ATHLETE AS AN ARISTOCRATIC GENTLEMAN BECAME OUTDATED. THE ADVENT OF THE STATE SPONSORED FULL TIME AMATEUR ATHLETE OF THE EASTERN BLOC COUNTRIES FURTHER ERODED THE IDEOLOGY OF THE PURE AMATEUR AS IT PUT THE SELF FINANCED AMATEURS OF THE WESTERN COUNTRIES AT A DISADVANTAGE. NEVERTHELESS THE IOC HELD TO THE TRADITIONAL RULES REGARDING AMATEURISM. 
BEGINNING IN THE 1970S AMATEURISM REQUIREMENTS WERE GRADUALLY PHASED OUT OF THE OLYMPIC CHARTER. AFTER THE 1988 GAMES THE IOC DECIDED TO MAKE ALL PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES ELIGIBLE FOR THE OLYMPICS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE IFS.
AS OF 2004 THE ONLY SPORT IN WHICH NO PROFESSIONALS COMPETE IS BOXING ALTHOUGH EVEN THIS REQUIRES A DEFINITION OF AMATEURISM BASED ON FIGHT RULES RATHER THAN ON PAYMENT AS SOME BOXERS RECEIVE CASH PRIZES FROM THEIR NATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEES. IN MEN S FOOTBALL SOCCER ONLY THREE PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS OVER THE AGE OF 23 ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE PER TEAM IN THE OLYMPIC TOURNAMENT.
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY COUNTRIES DELIBERATELY MISSING THE OLYMPICS IN ORDER TO MAKE POLITICAL STATEMENTS. THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES MISSING THE OLYMPICS HAPPENED IN 1980 AND 1984. THE COLD WAR OPPONENTS MISSED EACH OTHER S GAMES. 65 NATIONS REFUSED TO COMPETE AT THE MOSCOW OLYMPICS IN 1980 BECAUSE OF THE SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN. THE SOVIET UNION AND 14 OF ITS EASTERN BLOC PARTNERS EXCEPT ROMANIA COUNTERED BY MISSING THE LOS ANGELES OLYMPICS OF 1984. THE COUNTRIES STATED THAT THEY COULD NOT GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF THEIR ATHLETES. SOVIET OFFICIALS DEFENDED THEIR DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE GAMES BY SAYING THAT CHAUVINISTIC SENTIMENTS AND AN ANTI SOVIET HYSTERIA ARE BEING WHIPPED UP IN THE UNITED STATES.
THE OLYMPIC GAMES HAVE BEEN USED AS A PLATFORM TO PROMOTE POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES ALMOST FROM ITS INCEPTION. NAZI GERMANY WISHED TO PORTRAY THE NATIONALIST SOCIALIST PARTY AS BENEVOLENT AND PEACE LOVING WHEN THEY HOSTED THE 1936 GAMES. THE GAMES WERE ALSO INTENDED TO SHOW THE SUPERIORITY OF THE ARYAN WHITE RACE. THIS GOAL WAS NOT MET DUE IN PART TO THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF ATHLETES SUCH AS JESSE OWENS WHO WON FOUR GOLD MEDALS AT THIS OLYMPICS.
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETES HAVE ALSO USED THE OLYMPIC STAGE TO PROMOTE THEIR OWN POLITICAL AGENDA. AT THE 1968 SUMMER OLYMPICS IN MEXICO CITY TWO AMERICAN TRACK AND FIELD ATHLETES TOMMIE SMITH AND JOHN CARLOS WHO FINISHED FIRST AND THIRD IN THE 200METER SPRINT RACE PERFORMED THE BLACK POWER SALUTE ON THE PODIUM. THE RUNNER UP PETER NORMAN WORE AN OLYMPIC PROJECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS BADGE IN SUPPORT OF SMITH AND CARLOS. IOC PRESIDENT AVERY BRUNDAGE THEN TOLD THE UNITED STATES TO EITHER SEND THE TWO ATHLETES HOME OR WITHDRAW THE TRACK AND FIELD TEAM. THE UNITED STATES CHOSE TO SEND THE PAIR HOME.
IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY MANY OLYMPIC ATHLETES BEGAN USING DRUGS TO IMPROVE THEIR ATHLETIC ABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE THE WINNER OF THE MARATHON AT THE 1904 GAMES THOMAS J. HICKS WAS GIVEN STRYCHNINE AND BRANDY BY HIS COACH. THE ONLY OLYMPIC DEATH LINKED TO DOPING HAPPENED AT THE ROME GAMES OF 1960. DURING THE CYCLING ROAD RACE DANISH CYCLIST KNUD ENEMARK JENSEN FELL FROM HIS BICYCLE AND LATER DIED. A CORONER S INQUIRY FOUND THAT HE WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF AMPHETAMINES. BY THE MID 1960S SPORTS FEDERATIONS WERE STARTING TO BAN THE USE OF PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS. THE IOC DID LIKEWISE IN 1967. THE IOC CREATED THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGENCY IN 1999. THE IOC ESTABLISHED DRUG TESTING REGIMEN NOW KNOWN AS THE OLYMPIC STANDARD HAS SET THE WORLDWIDE BENCHMARK THAT OTHER SPORTING FEDERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD ATTEMPT TO EMULATE. THE FIRST OLYMPIC ATHLETE TO TEST POSITIVE FOR THE USE OF PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS WAS HANS GUNNAR LILJENWALL A SWEDISH PENTATHLETE AT THE 1968 SUMMER OLYMPICS WHO LOST HIS BRONZE MEDAL FOR ALCOHOL USE.
THE OLYMPICS HAVE NOT BROUGHT LASTING PEACE TO THE WORLD EVEN DURING THE GAMES. THREE OLYMPIC GAMES WERE NOT HELD DUE TO WAR. THE 1916 GAMES WERE CANCELLED BECAUSE OF WORLD WAR I AND THE SUMMER AND WINTER GAMES OF 1940 AND 1944 WERE CANCELLED BECAUSE OF WORLD WAR II. TERRORISM HAS ALSO THREATENED THE OLYMPIC GAMES. IN 1972 WHEN THE SUMMER GAMES WERE HELD IN MUNICH WEST GERMANY ELEVEN MEMBERS OF THE ISRAELI OLYMPIC TEAM WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE BY THE TERRORIST GROUP BLACK SEPTEMBER. THIS EVENT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE MUNICH MASSACRE. THE TERRORISTS KILLED TWO OF THE ATHLETES SOON AFTER THEY HAD TAKEN THEM HOSTAGE AND KILLED THE OTHER NINE DURING A FAILED RESCUE ATTEMPT. A GERMAN POLICE OFFICER AND 5 TERRORISTS ALSO DIED. DURING THE SUMMER OLYMPICS IN 1996 IN ATLANTA A BOMB WAS DETONATED AT THE CENTENNIAL OLYMPIC PARK WHICH KILLED 2 AND INJURED 111 OTHERS. ERIC ROBERT RUDOLPH IS CURRENTLY SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE FOR THE BOMBING.
THE HOST CITY FOR AN OLYMPIC GAMES IS CHOSEN SEVEN YEARS AHEAD OF THE EVENT. THE PROCESS OF SELECTION IS CARRIED OUT IN TWO PHASES THAT SPAN A TWO YEAR PERIOD. THE PROCESS STARTS WHEN A CITY WANTING TO HOST THE GAMES APPLIES TO ITS COUNTRY S OLYMPIC GROUP. IF MORE THAN ONE CITY FROM THE SAME COUNTRY GIVES A PROPOSAL TO ITS NOC THE NATIONAL GROUP CHOOSES WHICH CITY WILL RUN FOR HOST. THE FIRST STEP ONCE THE DEADLINE PASSES TO TELL THE IOC THAT YOU WANT TO HOLD THE GAMES IS TO ASK THE CITIES TO COMPLETE A QUESTIONNAIRE WHICH COVERS MANY KEY POINTS IN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES. THE EVALUATION OF THE FILLED QUESTIONNAIRES BY A GROUP PROVIDES THE IOC WITH AN IDEA OF EACH CITIES PROJECT AND THEIR POTENTIAL TO HOST THE GAMES. ON THE BASIS OF THIS EVALUATION THE IOC CHOOSES THE APPLICANTS THAT WILL PROCEED TO THE CANDIDATURE STAGE. 
ONCE THE CANDIDATE CITIES ARE CHOSEN THEY MUST GIVE TO THE IOC A BIGGER PRESENTATION OF THEIR PROJECT AS PART OF A CANDIDATURE FILE. EACH CITY IS ANALYZED BY AN EVALUATION GROUP. THIS GROUP WILL ALSO VISIT THE CITIES. THE GROUP GIVE A REPORT ON ITS FINDINGS ONE MONTH PRIOR TO THE IOC S FINAL DECISION. DURING THE INTERVIEW PROCESS THE CANDIDATE CITY MUST ALSO GUARANTEE THAT IT CAN FUND THE GAMES. THE IOC MEMBERS GATHERED IN THE MEETING HAVE THE FINAL VOTE ON THE HOST CITY. 
BY 2016 THE OLYMPIC GAMES WILL HAVE BEEN HOSTED BY 44 CITIES IN 23 COUNTRIES. THE UNITED STATES HAS HOSTED FOUR SUMMER AND FOUR WINTER OLYMPICS MORE THAN ANY OTHER NATION. AMONG SUMMER OLYMPICS HOST NATIONS THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS BEEN THE HOST OF THREE GAMES AND HOSTED ITS THIRD OLYMPICS IN 2012 IN LONDON. GERMANY AUSTRALIA FRANCE AND GREECE ARE THE OTHER NATIONS TO HAVE HOSTED THE SUMMER OLYMPICS TWICE. AMONG HOST CITIES ONLY LOS ANGELES PARIS ATHENS AND LONDON HAVE PLAYED HOST TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES MORE THAN ONCE WITH EACH HOLDING THAT HONOR TWICE. WITH THE 2012 GAMES THAT TOOK PLACE IN LONDON THE BRITISH CAPITAL HOLDS THE DISTINCTION OF HOSTING THE MODERN OLYMPICS GAMES THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANY OTHER CITY. PARIS WILL BE THE SECOND CITY TO HOST THE MODERN OLYMPICS GAMES THREE TIMES IN 2024 WHILE LOS ANGELES WILL BE THE THIRD CITY IN 2028.
IN THE WINTER OLYMPICS FRANCE HAS HOSTED THREE GAMES WHILE SWITZERLAND AUSTRIA NORWAY JAPAN AND ITALY HAVE HOSTED TWICE. THE MOST RECENT GAMES WERE HELD IN PYEONGCHANG SOUTH KOREA S FIRST WINTER OLYMPICS AND SECOND OVERALL. THE NEXT WINTER GAMES WILL BE IN BEIJING CHINA IN 2022 WHICH WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THIS NATION HAS HOSTED.
AND YOUTH OLYMPIC GAMES IN A SEPARATE LIST.
OPERA
OPERA IS A DRAMA SET TO MUSIC. AN OPERA IS LIKE A PLAY IN WHICH EVERYTHING IS SUNG INSTEAD OF SPOKEN. OPERAS ARE USUALLY PERFORMED IN OPERA HOUSES. THE SINGERS WHO SING AND ACT OUT THE STORY ARE ON THE STAGE AND THE ORCHESTRA IS IN FRONT OF THE STAGE BUT LOWER DOWN IN THE ORCHESTRA PIT SO THAT THE AUDIENCE CAN SEE THE STAGE.
AN OPERA IS NORMALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO THREE FOUR OR EVEN FIVE ACTS. IN OLDER OPERAS THE MUSIC WAS MOSTLY RECITATIVE AND ARIAS. DURING THE RECITATIVE THINGS WOULD HAPPEN IN THE STORY. THE ARIA WAS A SONG FOR A SOLO SINGER A SETTING OF A LYRIC. AS WELL AS RECITATIVE AND ARIA THERE WOULD BE CHORUSES. THE CHORUS WERE A GROUP OF SINGERS WHO SING IN THE CROWD SCENES. THE OPERA WOULD START WITH AN OVERTURE FOR THE ORCHESTRA. THE OVERTURE WOULD USUALLY INCLUDE TUNES THAT ARE GOING TO BE HEARD LATER IN THE OPERA. 
IN OPERAS FROM THE 19TH CENTURY ONWARDS THERE IS OFTEN LITTLE OR NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RECITATIVE AND ARIA. COMPOSERS LIKE WAGNER WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM OPERAS WHICH HAD LOTS OF SEPARATE ARIAS IN WHICH THE SINGERS SHOWED OFF WITH THE AUDIENCE CLAPPING LOUDLY AFTER EACH ONE. HE WANTED CONTINUOUS MUSIC SO THAT THE MOOD WOULD NOT BE BROKEN.
SOMETIMES OPERAS HAVE A LOT OF DANCING IN THEM. FRENCH OPERA ESPECIALLY WOULD OFTEN HAVE ONE ACT WHICH WAS FULL OF DANCES.
NOT ALL OPERAS HAVE MUSIC ALL THE TIME.
GRAND OPERA IS OPERA WHICH IS ALL SET TO MUSIC.
OP RA BOUFFE FRENCH OR OPERA BUFFA ITALIAN IS COMIC OPERA. THE STORY IS VERY LIGHT HEARTED AND FUNNY.
OP RA COMIQUE IS A FRENCH TERM FOR OPERA WHICH HAS SOME SPOKEN WORDS. SURPRISINGLY IT DOES NOT MEAN A COMIC OPERA. AN OPERA LIKE CARMEN WHICH IS A TRAGEDY IS STILL AN OP RA COMIQUE DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT USES SPOKEN DIALOGUES INSTEAD OF RECITATIVES.
SINGSPIEL IS A GERMAN TERM FOR A TYPE OF OPERA WITH LOTS OF MAGIC AND FANTASY IN THE STORY. THERE WERE SPOKEN WORDS BETWEEN THE SONGS. MOZART S MAGIC FLUTE IS AN EXAMPLE.
OPERETTA IS A SHORT OPERA WHICH IS LIGHT HEARTED AND USUALLY HAS SOME SPOKEN WORDS.
OPERA SINGERS HAVE TO HAVE POWERFUL VOICES AS WELL AS A GOOD TECHNIQUE. MOST OPERA HOUSES ARE VERY BIG AND THE SINGERS NEED TO BE HEARD AT THE BACK. THEY ALSO NEED TO BE GOOD AT ACTING. THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO LEARN THEIR MUSIC QUICKLY AND TO SING FROM MEMORY. IT IS A HELP TO BE GOOD AT LANGUAGES BECAUSE OPERAS ARE OFTEN IN ITALIAN GERMAN FRENCH ENGLISH OR RUSSIAN ETC. SOME OPERA COMPANIES LIKE THE ENGLISH NATIONAL OPERA SING THEIR OPERAS IN ENGLISH. OTHERS LIKE THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE SING OPERAS IN WHATEVER LANGUAGE THEY WERE COMPOSED IN. TRANSLATIONS ARE PRINTED ON A SCREEN ABOVE THE FRONT OF THE STAGE SURTITLES SO THAT THE AUDIENCE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEING SUNG.
ALTHOUGH SINGERS TRAIN TO GET A WIDE RANGE GOOD TOP AND BOTTOM NOTES THEY CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO SING ANY ROLE IN THEIR VOICE RANGE. FOR EXAMPLE SOME SOPRANOS MAY HAVE BIG DRAMATIC VOICES SUITABLE FOR PARTS LIKE TOSCA IN PUCCINI S OPERA TOSCA. SOME MAY HAVE A VERY LIGHT AND HIGH VOICE CALLED COLORATURA SUITABLE FOR PARTS LIKE THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT IN MOZART S MAGIC FLUTE. SOME MAY HAVE A MEDIUM RANGE CALLED MEZZO SOPRANO SUITABLE FOR PARTS LIKE CARMEN IN BIZET S OPERA CARMEN.
VERY OFTEN IN OPERA THE HEROINE IS A SOPRANO AND THE HERO IS A TENOR. BASSES MAY OFTEN HAVE THE PART OF A POWERFUL KING OR HE MAY BE THE BAD GUY.
THE 18TH CENTURY LEXICOGRAPHER AND CRITIC DR JOHNSON DESCRIBED OPERA AS AN EXOTIC AND IRRATIONAL ENTERTAINMENT. BY EXOTIC HE MEANT THAT IT CAME FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY WHICH IN THOSE DAYS WAS TRUE ALL OPERA AT THE TIME CAME FROM ITALY. BY IRRATIONAL HE MEANT THAT THE THINGS WHICH HAPPENED IN THE STORIES WERE STRANGE AND NOT LIKE REAL LIFE. A PLAY CAN BE LIKE REAL LIFE BUT AN OPERA IS BEING SUNG SO THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO HAPPEN LIKE THEY NORMALLY DO IN REAL LIFE. A SINGER MIGHT BE SINGING I MUST GO I MUST GO AND HE MAY STAND ON THE STAGE AND SING THIS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE AT LAST HE GOES A SINGER MAY BE PRETENDING TO DIE AND WILL SING A BEAUTIFUL SONG BEFORE HE OR SHE FINALLY DIES. THESE THINGS ARE CONVENTIONS WHICH MEANS THAT THEY ARE A KIND OF HABIT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT WHEN WATCHING AND LISTENING TO OPERA. ANOTHER CONVENTION OF EARLIER OPERAS WAS TO HAVE THE PART OF YOUNG MEN SUNG BY WOMEN. THIS IS SOMETIMES CALLED A BREECHES ROLE OR TROUSER ROLE. THEY ARE OFTEN SMALL PARTS SUCH AS PAGE BOYS OR TEENAGERS WHO FLIRT WITH OLDER WOMEN SUCH AS THE PART OF CHERUBINO IN MOZART S THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO OR OKTAVIAN IN RICHARD STRAUSS S DER ROSENKAVALIER. IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT IN THE 18TH CENTURY IT WAS USUAL FOR THE MAIN FEMALE PART TO BE SUNG BY A MAN WHO WAS A CASTRATO. THAT SEEMS A VERY STRANGE AND CRUEL CONVENTION TO US NOW.
THERE ARE LOTS OF FAMOUS OPERAS AND THE BEST ONES HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST MUSIC EVER WRITTEN. THE MUSIC COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN LIKE THAT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN WRITTEN FOR OPERA. FOR EXAMPLE MOZART IS VERY CLEVER AT WRITING MUSIC WHERE MAYBE SIX PEOPLE ARE ALL SINGING DIFFERENT THINGS AT ONCE BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE STORY.
MEDIEVAL OPERA MID 12TH CENTURY 
ONE OF THE FIRST OPERAS EVER WRITTEN WAS BY HILDEGARD OF BINGEN. ORDO VIRTUTUM LATIN FOR ORDER OF THE VIRTUES IS AN ALLEGORICAL OR COMPOSED C. 1151 DURING THE CONSTRUCTION AND RELOCATION OF BINGEN S ABBEY AT RUPERTSBERG. IT IS THE EARLIEST MORALITY PLAY BY MORE THAN A CENTURY AND THE ONLY MEDIEVAL MUSICAL DRAMA TO SURVIVE WITH AN ATTRIBUTION FOR BOTH THE TEXT AND THE MUSIC.
A SHORT VERSION OF ORDO VIRTUTUM WITHOUT MUSIC APPEARS AT THE END OF HILDEGARD S MOST FAMOUS ACCOUNT OF HER VISIONS. IT IS ALSO INCLUDED IN SOME MANUSCRIPTS OF THE SYMPHONIA ARMONIAE CELESTIUM REVELATIONUM SYMPHONY OF THE HARMONY OF CELESTIAL REVELATIONS A CYCLE OF MORE THAN 70 LITURGICAL SONGS. IT MAY HAVE BEEN PERFORMED BY THE CONVENT NUNS AT THE DEDICATION OF THE ST. CHURCH IN 1152 OR POSSIBLY BEFORE THE AT THE CONVENT.
THE FIRST BAROQUE OPERA EVER WRITTEN WAS PERFORMED IN 1597 IN FLORENCE IN ITALY. IT WAS CALLED DAFNE AND THE COMPOSER WAS JACOPO PERI. THIS OPERA IS NOW LOST BUT THREE YEARS LATER IN 1600 HE WORKED TOGETHER WITH ANOTHER COMPOSER CALLED GIULIO CACCINI TO WRITE AN OPERA CALLED EURIDICE. THE MUSIC FOR THIS STILL EXISTS. IT WAS NEARLY ALL RECITATIVE. THIS KIND OF WRITING WAS NEW BUT IF OPERA WAS TO TELL A STORY IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SOLO VOICE SINGING WORDS THAT COULD BE HEARD. THEY WERE TRYING TO PRODUCE SOMETHING LIKE AN ANCIENT GREEK TRAGEDY. IT WAS PERFORMED AT A KIND OF CLUB CALLED CAMERATA FOR INTELLECTUAL CLEVER PEOPLE TO A SMALL AUDIENCE. IT WAS NOT GREAT MUSIC BUT THE AMAZING THING WAS THAT THERE WAS A COMPOSER OF GENIUS AROUND. HIS NAME WAS CLAUDIO MONTEVERDI AND ONLY SEVEN YEARS LATER IN 1607 HE WROTE THE FIRST REALLY GOOD OPERA ORFEO WHICH WAS PRODUCED IN MANTUA. MONTEVERDI MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT OPERA HAD THE POSSIBILITIES OF PUTTING POETRY MUSIC SCENERY AND ACTING ALL TOGETHER. HE TOOK THE KIND OF SONGS THAT WERE POPULAR AT THE TIME AND JOINED THEM WITH SPEAKING OR RECITATIVE. LATER IN LIFE HE JOINED THESE SO THAT THE MUSIC FLOWED MORE DRAMATICALLY.
IN 1637 THE FIRST PUBLIC OPERA HOUSE WAS OPENED IN VENICE. SOON LOTS OF THEATRES IN ITALY STARTED TO PRODUCE OPERAS. THE STORIES WERE USUALLY ABOUT ANCIENT TIMES LIKE THE ROMAN EMPIRE OR GREEK MYTHS. THEY STARTED TO PUT IN COMIC FUNNY BITS TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH. SOON THERE WAS OPERA IN PARIS VIENNA HAMBURG AND IN THE SMALL COURTS OF GERMANY WHICH IN THOSE DAYS WAS LOTS OF LITTLE COUNTRIES EACH WITH THEIR OWN PRINCE WHO RULED AND WHO KEPT MUSICIANS AT COURT. THE COMPOSERS WHO ARE BEST REMEMBERED TODAY INCLUDE JEAN BAPTISTE LULLY 1632 1687 WHO WAS AN ITALIAN WHO MOVED TO FRANCE AND WROTE OPERAS FOR THE FRENCH KING AND GEORGE FRIDERIC HANDEL 1685 1759 WHO WAS A GERMAN WHO MOVED TO ENGLAND AND WROTE OPERAS FOR THE OPERA HOUSES IN LONDON. IN ITALY THERE WERE COMPOSERS LIKE FRANCESCO CAVALLI 1602 1676 WHO HAD BEEN A CHOIRBOY IN MONTEVERDI S CHURCH CHOIR IN VENICE AND ALESSANDRO SCARLATTI 1660 1725 WHO LIVED IN NAPLES.
DURING THIS PERIOD KNOWN AS THE BAROQUE PERIOD THE OPERA WAS AN ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE UPPER CLASSES WHO WENT TO THE OPERA TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC. OPERA WAS A SOCIAL OCCASION WHERE YOU COULD MEET PEOPLE AND TALK EVEN DURING THE MUSIC. BOTH THE SINGERS AND THE AUDIENCE BEHAVED IN WAYS THAT WE WOULD THINK WERE BAD MANNERS.
CHRISTOPH WILLIBALD GLUCK WAS A COMPOSER WHO TRIED TO MAKE PEOPLE TAKE OPERA MORE SERIOUSLY. IN 1762 HE WROTE AN OPERA CALLED WHICH WAS PERFORMED IN VIENNA. IT HAD LOTS OF CHORUSES AND BALLET NUMBERS LIKE FRENCH OPERA BUT THE WORDS WERE IN ITALIAN AND THE MUSIC REALLY CONCENTRATED ON THE STORY RATHER THAN BEING JUST A DISPLAY FOR CLEVER SINGERS TO SHOW OFF. SOME OF ITS MUSIC IS VERY FAMOUS TODAY E.G. THE DANCE OF THE BLESSED SPIRITS WHICH IS PLAYED ON A FLUTE AND ORFEO S ARIA CHE FAR SENZA EURIDICE WHAT SHALL I DO WITHOUT EURIDICE.
MOZART LEARNED FROM GLUCK S IDEAS ABOUT OPERA. THIS CAN BE SEEN IN HIS OPERA IDOMENEO WHICH IS ABOUT A GREEK STORY. OTHER ITALIAN OPERAS BY MOZART INCLUDE DON GIOVANNI LE NOZZE DI FIGARO AND COSI FAN TUTTE. HE ALSO WROTE OPERAS IN GERMAN THE ABDUCTION FROM THE SERAIL AND THE MAGIC FLUTE. THESE ARE SINGSPIEL OPERAS WHICH TELL MAGIC AND FANTASY STORIES.
LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN 1770 1827 ONLY WROTE ONE OPERA FIDELIO. IT IS A STORY OF A WOMAN WHO RESCUES HER LOVER FROM PRISON. RESCUE OPERAS WERE POPULAR IN FRANCE BUT THIS ONE IS IN GERMAN. IT IS A SERIOUS OPERA ABOUT HOW A WOMAN CAN SAVE A MAN BY BEING TRUE AND FAITHFUL.
IN THE 19TH CENTURY RICHARD WAGNER 1813 1883 CONTINUED GLUCK S IDEAS. WAGNER HAD VERY PERSONAL IDEAS ABOUT HOW HIS OPERAS SHOULD BE PERFORMED AND HE LIKED TO TRAIN THE SINGERS HIMSELF. HE WANTED THEM TO TAKE THE DRAMA OF HIS OPERAS SERIOUSLY INSTEAD OF TREATING THE MUSIC AS A WAY OF SHOWING OFF THEIR VOICES. HE ALWAYS WROTE THE LIBRETTI WORDS FOR THE OPERA HIMSELF AND THEY WERE ALWAYS IN GERMAN. THEY ARE MOSTLY ABOUT SERIOUS SUBJECTS FROM GERMAN FOLKLORE AND MYTHS ALTHOUGH HE DID WRITE ONE COMIC OPERA THE MASTERSINGERS OF N RNBERG. WAGNER USED LEITMOTIFS WHICH MEANS THAT THERE ARE TUNES WHICH ARE USED FOR PARTICULAR CHARACTERS OR IDEAS IN THE OPERA. THIS ALLOWS THE MUSIC TO DEVELOP WITH THE STORY AND CAN BE USED IN INTERESTING WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN SIGMUND IN THE OPERA DIE WALK RE SAYS THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW WHO HIS FATHER IS WE HEAR HIS FATHER S TUNE IN THE ORCHESTRA THE AUDIENCE OF COURSE KNOW THIS IS CALLED DRAMATIC IRONY.
IN ITALY GIOACHINO ROSSINI 1792 1868 WROTE LOTS OF OPERAS. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN STYLE BETWEEN HIS COMIC AND HIS SERIOUS OPERAS. OFTEN THE SAME OVERTURE WAS USED FOR BOTH. HE WROTE EXACTLY ALL THE NOTES THAT THE SINGERS WERE TO SING HE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE IT TO THEM TO IMPROVISE THEIR OWN ORNAMENTAL NOTES. EVERYTHING WAS CAREFULLY THOUGHT OUT. MUSICIANS ARE NOT SURE WHETHER TO CALL HIM A CLASSICAL OR ROMANTIC COMPOSER. COMPOSERS LIKE VINCENZO BELLINI 1801 1835 AND GAETANO DONIZETTI 1797 1848 ARE DEFINITELY ROMANTIC. THEY HAD THE ABILITY TO WRITE LOVELY LYRICAL TUNES. THE MOST FAMOUS ITALIAN OPERA COMPOSER OF THE 19TH CENTURY WAS GIUSEPPE VERDI 1813 1901. HIS MUSIC IS NOT ALWAYS CONTINUOUS LIKE WAGNER S. SOMETIMES IT STOPPED FOR THE AUDIENCE TO APPLAUD. VERDI HAD A WONDERFUL SENSE OF DRAMA AND COULD WRITE BEAUTIFUL MELODIES WHICH CAPTURED PEOPLE S HEARTS. HE LOVED SHAKESPEARE AND BASED SEVERAL OF HIS OPERAS ON SHAKESPEARE PLAYS OTELLO MACBETH AND FALSTAFF. 
THE 19TH CENTURY WAS THE TIME WHEN NATIONALISM WAS IMPORTANT. COMPOSERS WERE WRITING MUSIC TYPICAL OF THEIR OWN COUNTRIES. WAGNER AS WE HAVE SEEN TOOK GERMAN MYTHS FOR HIS OPERA STORIES. IN SPAIN THEY HAD THEIR OWN KIND OF OPERA CALLED ZARZUELA. IN RUSSIA MIKHAIL GLINKA 1804 1857 WROTE RUSLAN AND LYUDMILA WHICH WAS BASED ON A RUSSIAN FAIRY TALE. OTHER RUSSIAN COMPOSERS INCLUDE ALEXANDER BORODIN WHO WROTE PRINCE IGOR AND MODEST MUSSORGSKY 1839 1881 WHO WROTE BORIS GODUNOV. BOTH THESE OPERAS ARE ABOUT STORIES FROM RUSSIAN HISTORY. NIKOLAI RIMSKY KORSAKOV 1844 1908 WROTE A FAIRY TALE OPERA SADKO AND PYOTR TCHAIKOVSKY 1840 1893 USED SOME VERY RUSSIAN TUNES IN EUGENE ONEGIN AND THE QUEEN OF SPADES. 
CZECH COMPOSERS WROTE NATIONAL OPERAS. THE MOST FAMOUS CZECH OPERA COMPOSERS WERE ANTON N DVO K 1841 1904 BED ICH SMETANA 1824 1884 AND LEO JAN EK 1854 1928. IN FRANCE THE MOST FAMOUS COMPOSER WAS CHARLES GOUNOD 1818 1893 WHO WROTE AN OPERA CALLED FAUST.
IN THE 20TH CENTURY COMPOSERS HAD MANY DIFFERENT STYLES OF COMPOSING. THIS WAS TRUE OF ALL KINDS OF MUSIC INCLUDING OPERA. RICHARD STRAUSS 1864 1949 WAS REALLY A ROMANTIC ALTHOUGH ALMOST ALL HIS OPERAS WERE WRITTEN IN THE 20TH CENTURY. HIS HARMONIES SHOW THAT HE HAD STUDIED WAGNER S OPERAS. DER ROSENKAVALIER 1909 HAS LOTS OF ROMANTIC TUNES ALTHOUGH IT IS A STORY ABOUT VIENNA IN THE CLASSICAL PERIOD. IN ITALY COMPOSERS LIKE GIACOMO PUCCINI 1858 1924 WROTE OPERAS IN THE VERISMO STYLE. THIS MEANT OPERAS WITH STORIES THAT FELT LIKE REAL LIFE. THE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES WERE USUALLY FROM THE LOWER CLASSES. 
ALBAN BERG 1885 1935 ALSO WROTE OPERAS ABOUT POOR OR SIMPLE PEOPLE. HE WROTE AN OPERA CALLED WOZZECK WHICH IS THE TRAGEDY OF A MAN WHO IS TOO SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING UNKIND TO HIM AND USING HIM. BERG S MUSIC IS OFTEN BUILT ON THE TWELVE TONE SERIES WHICH HE HAD LEARNED FROM SCHOENBERG. STRAVINSKY S 1882 1971 THE RAKE S PROGRESS IS IN YET ANOTHER STYLE CALLED NEO CLASSICAL BECAUSE THE MUSIC IS MADE TO SOUND A BIT LIKE MUSIC OF THE CLASSICAL PERIOD. IN ENGLAND BRITTEN WROTE MANY GREAT OPERAS LIKE PETER GRIMES AND BILLY BUDD. MOST OF THEM ARE ABOUT UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE PART OF SOCIETY BUT ARE NOT ACCEPTED. 
MORE RECENT COMPOSERS WHO WROTE OPERAS INCLUDE THE HUNGARIAN GY RGY LIGETI 1923 2006 THE POLISH KRZYSZTOF PENDERECKI B.1933 THE ENGLISH SIR HARRISON BIRTWISTLE AND THE AMERICANS PHILIP GLASS B.1937 AND JOHN ADAMS B.1947.
OPERATION OVERLORD
OPERATION OVERLORD WAS THE 1944 CAMPAIGN FOR THE INVASION OF CONTINENTAL EUROPE IN WORLD WAR II. IT WAS FOUGHT BY THE ALLIED FORCES AGAINST GERMAN FORCES. THE MOST CRITICAL PART WAS THE NORMANDY INVASION WHICH WAS TO GET THE ALLIED ARMIES ONTO THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE. IT WAS CRITICAL BECAUSE IT MIGHT HAVE FAILED. HEAVY CASUALTIES WERE EXPECTED EVEN IF IT SUCCEEDED. IT WAS SUCCESSFUL. THE BATTLE OF NORMANDY RAGED UNTIL GERMAN FORCES RETREATED ACROSS THE SEINE ON 30 AUGUST 1944. THIS MARKED THE CLOSE OF OPERATION OVERLORD.
IT WAS THE LARGEST INVASION BY SEA IN HISTORY. ALMOST THREE MILLION TROOPS CROSSING THE ENGLISH CHANNEL FROM ENGLAND TO NORMANDY IN THEN GERMAN OCCUPIED FRANCE.
THE MAIN ALLIED FORCES CAME FROM THE UNITED STATES UNITED KINGDOM AND CANADA BUT ANOTHER NINE NATIONS SENT UNITS THE REST BEING AUSTRALIA BELGIUM CZECH REPUBLIC FRANCE GREECE THE NETHERLANDS NEW ZEALAND NORWAY AND POLAND.
ALLIED TROOPS MADE MANY PRACTICE LANDINGS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO IT.
MAPS OF NORMANDY BEACHES WERE CREATED. THE PLANNERS KNEW HEAVY TANKS AND TRANSPORT COULD NOT TRAVEL ON THE BEACHES WHICH HAD SOFT PEAT UNDERNEATH THEM. DETAILED MAPS OF THE AREA WERE REQUIRED. WHERE PEAT HAD TO BE TRAVELLED ON THE PLAN WAS TO LAY DOWN MATTING.
ON 7 APRIL AND 15 MAY BERNARD MONTGOMERY PRESENTED HIS PLAN FOR THE INVASION. HE PLANNED A NINETY DAY BATTLE ENDING WHEN ALL THE FORCES REACHED THE SEINE. 
THE GOAL FOR THE FIRST 40 DAYS WAS TO CAPTURE CAEN AND CHERBOURG ESPECIALLY CHERBOURG FOR ITS DEEP WATER PORT. THEN BRITTANY AND ITS ATLANTIC PORTS WOULD BE CAPTURED. RAILWAYS AND ROADS IN NORTHERN FRANCE WOULD BE BOMBED TO BLOCK REINFORCEMENTS FOR THE DEFENDERS. NEXT THE ALLIES WOULD GO 125 MILES 190 KM TO THE SOUTHWEST OF PARIS. THE ALLIES WOULD THEN CONTROL THE LAND BETWEEN THE RIVERS LOIRE IN THE SOUTH AND SEINE IN THE NORTHEAST.
MEANWHILE THE ALLIES MADE GREAT EFFORTS TO MAKE THE GERMANS THINK THE INVASION WOULD HAPPEN ELSEWHERE.
THE ALLIES DEVELOPED NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR OVERLORD. THE MULBERRY A MOBILE CONCRETE HARBOR ALLOWED THE ALLIES TO SUPPLY THEIR SOLDIERS ON THE BEACH WITHOUT CAPTURING ONE OF THE HEAVILY DEFENDED CHANNEL PORTS. MAJOR GENERAL PERCY HOBART A MILITARY ENGINEER DESIGNED MODIFIED SHERMAN AND CHURCHILL TANKS.
IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE INVASION THE ALLIES WORKED AT MILITARY DECEPTION. GERMAN COASTAL DEFENCES WERE STRETCHED THIN IN 1944. ONCE NORMANDY HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS THE SITE OF THE INVASION IT WAS DECIDED TO ATTEMPT TO TRICK THE GERMANS INTO THINKING IT WAS A FAKE INVASION AND THAT THE TRUE INVASION WAS TO BE ELSEWHERE. THIS WAS CALLED OPERATION BODYGUARD. IN THE WEEKS LEADING UP TO THE INVASION THE ALLIES TRIED TO MAKE THE GERMANS THINK THAT THE MAIN INVASION WOULD TAKE PLACE AT THE PAS DE CALAIS AND IN NORWAY. THE DECEPTION WAS AN INDUSTRY IN ITSELF. IT INCLUDED DUMMY MESSAGES DUMMY TANKS IN PLACES NEAR DOVER AND THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND USING DOUBLE AGENTS TO SPREAD FALSE INFORMATION DUMMY RADIO MESSAGES AND SO ON.
THE DECEPTION WAS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL. IT LED HITLER TO DELAY SENDING REINFORCEMENTS FROM THE PAS DE CALAIS REGION FOR NEARLY SEVEN WEEKS THE ORIGINAL PLAN HAD SPECIFIED 14 DAYS. IN HIS MEMOIRS GENERAL OMAR BRADLEY CALLED BODYGUARD THE SINGLE BIGGEST HOAX OF THE WAR.
ALLIED FORCES REHEARSED THEIR ROLES FOR D DAY MONTHS BEFORE THE INVASION. ON 28 APRIL 1944 IN SOUTH DEVON ON THE BRITISH COAST 946 AMERICAN SOLDIERS AND SAILORS WERE KILLED WHEN GERMAN TORPEDO BOATS ATTACKED ONE OF THESE LANDING EXERCISES EXERCISE TIGER.
THE SECURITY OF D DAY WAS SUPPORTED BY STOPPING UNPLANNED NEWS FROM GETTING OUT OF BRITAIN. TRAVEL TO AND FROM THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND WAS BANNED AND MOVEMENTS NEAR THE COASTS WAS NOT ALLOWED. THE GERMAN EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES IN NEUTRAL COUNTRIES WERE GIVEN FALSE INFORMATION.
ALL THE SAME THERE WERE SEVERAL LEAKS BEFORE OR ON D DAY. AN EMBASSY SPY IN ISTANBUL GAVE THE GERMANS DOCUMENTS CONTAINING REFERENCES TO OVERLORD BUT THESE DOCUMENTS LACKED DETAIL. ANOTHER LEAK WAS GENERAL CHARLES DE GAULLE S RADIO MESSAGE AFTER D DAY. HE STATED THAT THIS INVASION WAS THE REAL INVASION. THIS HAD THE POTENTIAL TO RUIN THE ALLIED TRICKS. EISENHOWER REFERRED TO THE LANDINGS AS THE INITIAL INVASION. THE GERMANS DID NOT BELIEVE DE GAULLE AND WAITED TOO LONG TO MOVE IN EXTRA TROOPS AGAINST THE ALLIES.
THE BRITISH DID AN AIRBORNE ASSAULT ON THE RIVER ORNE. THE BRITISH GOAL WAS TO CAPTURE THE ORNE RIVER BRIDGES TO PREVENT GERMAN ARMOR FROM USING THEM AND TO PREVENT RETREATING GERMANS FROM BLOWING THEM UP. THIS WAY THEY COULD BE USED BY ALLIED ARMOR AND VEHICLES. 
THE BRITISH SEA ATTACK UNITS WOULD ATTACK THROUGH SWORD AND GOLD BEACHES. THE UNITED STATES HAD AN AIRBORNE DIVISION AND LAND UNITS WHICH WERE TO TAKE OMAHA BEACH THE POINTE DU HOC AND UTAH BEACH. THE CANADIANS WOULD WORK WITH BRITISH UNITS TO ATTACK SWORD BEACH. THE BRITISH AND CANADIANS HAD SEPARATE BEACHES GOLD BEACH AND JUNO BEACH RESPECTIVELY.
THE INVASION FLEET WAS MADE UPFROM EIGHT NAVIES MADE UP OF WARSHIPS AND SUBMARINES SPLIT INTO THE WESTERN NAVAL TASK FORCE REAR ADMIRAL ALAN G KIRK AND THE EASTERN NAVAL TASK FORCE REAR ADMIRAL SIR PHILIP VIAN. THE FLEET WAS LED BY ADMIRAL SIR BERTRAM RAMSAY.
THE ALLIES ASSIGNED CODENAMES TO THE VARIOUS OPERATIONS INVOLVED IN THE INVASION. OVERLORD WAS THE NAME FOR THE LANDING ON THE CONTINENT. GETTING A SECURE HOLD ON THE AREA WAS CODENAMED NEPTUNE. IT BEGAN ON D DAY 6 JUNE 1944 AND ENDED ON 30 JUNE 1944. BY THIS TIME THE ALLIES HAD CONTROL IN NORMANDY. OPERATION OVERLORD ALSO BEGAN ON D DAY AND CONTINUED UNTIL ALLIED FORCES CROSSED THE RIVER SEINE ON 19 AUGUST 1944.
THROUGH MOST OF 1942 AND 1943 THE GERMANS THOUGHT SUCCESSFUL ALLIED INVASION IN THE WEST WOULD NOT HAPPEN. PREPARATIONS WERE LIMITED TO BUILDING FORTIFICATIONS AT THE MAJOR PORTS. THE NUMBER OF MILITARY FORCES IN NAZI GERMANY REACHED ITS PEAK DURING 1944 WITH 59 DIVISIONS IN FRANCE BELGIUM AND THE NETHERLANDS.
FIELD MARSHAL ERWIN ROMMEL WAS IN CHARGE OF THE WALL. HE IMPROVED THE DEFENCES OF THE ENTIRE COASTLINE. STEEL OBSTACLES WERE PUT ON BEACHES CONCRETE BUNKERS AND PILLBOXES CONSTRUCTED AND LOW LYING AREAS WERE FLOODED. POINTED STAKES WERE SET UP ON LIKELY LANDING GROUNDS TO MAKE IT HARD FOR THE ALLIES TO DO AIRBORNE LANDINGS. THE GERMANS FORTIFIED THE FORESHORE AREA AS PART OF THEIR ATLANTIC WALL DEFENCES INCLUDING TANK TURRETS AND BARBED WIRE.
THESE PROJECTS WERE NOT FINISHED ESPECIALLY IN THE NORMANDY SECTOR. ALLIED BOMBING OF THE FRENCH RAILWAY SYSTEM MADE IT HARD TO MOVE MATERIALS AND THE GERMANS WERE CONVINCED BY THE ALLIED TRICKS THAT THE LANDINGS WOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE PAS DE CALAIS.
THE SECTOR WHICH WAS ATTACKED WAS GUARDED BY FOUR DIVISIONS OF WHICH THE 352ND AND 91ST WERE OF HIGH QUALITY. THE OTHER DEFENDING TROOPS INCLUDED GERMANS WHO WERE NOT FIT FOR ACTIVE DUTY ON THE EASTERN FRONT CONSCRIPTED POLES AND FORMER SOVIET PRISONERS OF WAR WHO HAD AGREED TO FIGHT FOR THE GERMANS. THESE UNITS HAD GERMAN LEADERS.
ROMMEL S DEFENSIVE MEASURES WERE MADE DIFFICULT BY ARGUMENTS OVER HOW TO USE ARMOURED FORCES. VON GEYR AND ROMMEL DISAGREED OVER THE HOW TO USE PANZER DIVISIONS.
ROMMEL THOUGHT ARMOURED FORMATIONS BE CLOSE TO THE COAST TO ATTACK WHILE THE INVADERS WERE WEAK. VON GEYR SAID THEY SHOULD INSTEAD BE PUT AROUND PARIS AND USED IN A BIG GROUP WHEN THE GERMANS KNEW WHICH BEACH WAS BEING INVADED. HITLER MADE A COMPROMISE SOLUTION.
ROMMEL WAS GIVEN ONLY THREE TANK DIVISIONS ONE OF WHICH WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE NORMANDY BEACHES TO FIGHT ON THE FIRST DAY. THE OTHER MECHANIZED DIVISIONS WERE PUT UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE GERMAN ARMED FORCES HQ OKW AND WERE PLACED ACROSS FRANCE BELGIUM AND THE NETHERLANDS.
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LAUNCHING AN INVASION WAS LIMITED TO ONLY A FEW DAYS IN EACH MONTH BECAUSE A FULL MOON WAS NEEDED. THIS WOULD PROVIDE LIGHT FOR THE AIRCRAFT PILOTS AND CREATE A SPRING TIDE. EISENHOWER HAD PICKED 5 JUNE AS THE DATE FOR THE ASSAULT. HOWEVER ON 4 JUNE CONDITIONS WERE UNSUITABLE FOR A LANDING. HIGH WINDS AND HEAVY SEAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LAUNCH LANDING CRAFT. LOW CLOUDS WOULD PREVENT AIRCRAFT FINDING THEIR TARGETS.
METEOROLOGISTS PREDICTED AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE WEATHER FOR 6 JUNE. AT A MEETING ON 5 JUNE EISENHOWER AND HIS SENIOR COMMANDERS DISCUSSED THE SITUATION. EISENHOWER DECIDED TO LAUNCH THE INVASION THAT NIGHT. HAD EISENHOWER DELAYED THE INVASION THE ONLY OPTION WAS TO GO TWO WEEKS LATER. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN DURING STORMY WEATHER.
TO MAKE IT HARD FOR THE GERMANS TO LAUNCH ATTACKS DURING THE SEA ATTACK PHASE AIRBORNE OPERATIONS WERE USED TO CAPTURE BRIDGES AND ROAD CROSSINGS. THE AIRBORNE LANDINGS BEHIND THE BEACHES WERE ALSO DESIGNED TO HELP THE SOLDIERS LANDING ON BEACHES AND DESTROY GERMAN COASTAL DEFENSE ARTILLERY.
ON SWORD BEACH THE REGULAR BRITISH INFANTRY CAME ASHORE WITH FEW CASUALTIES. THEY HAD ADVANCED ABOUT BY THE END OF THE DAY BUT DID NOT GET AS FAR AS MONTGOMERY HAD WANTED. CAEN WAS STILL HELD BY GERMANS BY THE END OF D DAY AND WOULD REMAIN SO UNTIL OPERATION CHARNWOOD ON 9 JULY.
THE CANADIAN FORCES THAT LANDED ON JUNO BEACH HAD A DIFFICULT BATTLE. GERMAN CONCRETE FORTIFICATIONS AND A SEA WALL TWICE AS HIGH AS AT OMAHA BEACH MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO ATTACK. JUNO WAS THE SECOND MOST HEAVILY DEFENDED BEACH ON D DAY NEXT TO OMAHA. CANADIANS WERE OFF THE BEACH WITHIN HOURS AND ADVANCING INLAND. THEY WERE THE ONLY UNITS TO REACH THEIR D DAY GOALS ALTHOUGH MOST UNITS FELL BACK A FEW KILOMETRES TO MAKE STRONGER DEFENSIVE POSITIONS.
AT GOLD BEACH THERE WERE MANY DEAD AND WOUNDED BECAUSE THE GERMANS HAD STRONGLY FORTIFIED A VILLAGE ON THE BEACH. THE 50TH NORTHUMBRIAN INFANTRY DIVISION ADVANCED ALMOST TO BAYEUX BY THE END OF THE DAY. WHEN COMMANDO UNITS CAPTURED THE PORT EN BESSIN THE ALLIES COULD USE THEIR PLUTO PIPELINE TO BRING IN FUEL.
THE AMERICANS WHO LANDED ON OMAHA BEACH FACED THE VETERAN GERMAN 352ND INFANTRY DIVISION ONE OF THE BEST TRAINED GROUPS ON THE BEACHES. FURTHERMORE OMAHA WAS THE MOST HEAVILY FORTIFIED BEACH. COMMANDERS CONSIDERED ABANDONING THE BEACH BUT SMALL UNITS OF INFANTRY GOT PAST THE COASTAL DEFENCES. BY THE END OF DAY TWO AREAS HAD BEEN CAPTURED. THE CONTROL OVER THE BEACH EXPANDED OVER THE FOLLOWING DAYS AND THE D DAY GOALS WERE ACCOMPLISHED BY D 3.
AT POINTE DU HOC THE 2ND RANGER BATTALION HAD TO CLIMB THE CLIFFS. WHILE THEY CLIMBED THE ENEMY SHOT AT THEM AND DROPPED GRENADES. THEY USED ROPES AND LADDERS TO CLIMB UP AND THEN DESTROY THE GUNS.
THE BEACH FORTIFICATIONS WERE IMPORTANT TARGETS SINCE A SINGLE ARTILLERY OBSERVER COULD HAVE DIRECTED FIRE ON THE U.S. BEACHES. THE RANGERS CAPTURED THE FORTIFICATIONS. THEY THEN HAD TO FIGHT FOR 2 DAYS TO HOLD THE LOCATION LOSING MORE THAN 60 PERCENT OF THEIR MEN.
THE NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED ON UTAH BEACH THE WESTERNMOST LANDING ZONE WERE THE LIGHTEST OF ANY BEACH. ONLY 197 OUT OF THE 23 000 TROOPS THAT LANDED WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED. THE 4TH INFANTRY DIVISION TROOPS THAT LANDED ON THE BEACH WAS ABLE TO MOVE INLAND BY EARLY AFTERNOON LINKING UP WITH THE 101ST AIRBORNE DIVISION.
ONCE THE BEACHES WERE CONTROLLED THE MULBERRY HARBOURS WERE SET UP AROUND 9 JUNE. ONE WAS CONSTRUCTED AT ARROMANCHES BY BRITISH FORCES THE OTHER AT OMAHA BEACH BY AMERICAN FORCES. SEVERE STORMS ON 19 JUNE CAUSED PROBLEMS WITH THE LANDING OF SUPPLIES AND DESTROYED THE OMAHA HARBOUR. THE ARROMANCHES HARBOUR WAS ABLE TO SUPPLY AROUND 9 000 TONS DAILY UNTIL THE END OF AUGUST 1944 BY WHICH TIME THE PORT OF CHERBOURG HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY THE ALLIES.
THE GERMAN 21ST PANZER DIVISION ATTACKED BETWEEN SWORD AND JUNO BEACHES AND NEARLY REACHED THE CHANNEL. ALLIED ANTI TANK GUNNERS MADE THEM PULL BACK BEFORE THE END OF 6 JUNE.
THE ALLIED INVASION PLANS HAD CALLED FOR THE CAPTURE OF CARENTAN ST. L CAEN AND BAYEUX ON THE FIRST DAY. THE PLAN WAS TO LINK ALL THE BEACHES EXCEPT UTAH AND SWORD THE LAST LINKED WITH PARATROOPERS AND A FRONT LINE FROM THE BEACHES. NONE OF THESE GOALS HAD BEEN ACHIEVED. THE NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED HAD NOT BEEN AS HEAVY AS SOME HAD FEARED AROUND 10 000 COMPARED TO THE 20 000 CHURCHILL HAD ESTIMATED AND THE BRIDGES HAD SURVIVED THE GERMAN ATTACKS.
IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE INVASION AREA US TROOPS WERE TO OCCUPY THE COTENTIN PENINSULA ESPECIALLY CHERBOURG. THIS WOULD PROVIDE THE ALLIES WITH A DEEP WATER HARBOUR. THE LAND BEHIND UTAH AND OMAHA WAS BANKS AND HEDGEROWS THAT TANKS GUNFIRE AND VISION COULD NOT GET THROUGH. THIS MADE THEM IDEAL DEFENSIVE POSITIONS.
THE U.S. INFANTRY MADE SLOW PROGRESS AND HAD MANY DEAD AND WOUNDED AS THEY MOVED TOWARDS CHERBOURG. THE AIRBORNE TROOPS WERE USED TO HELP WITH THE ADVANCE. THE FAR SIDE OF THE PENINSULA WAS REACHED ON 18 JUNE. HITLER TOLD GERMAN FORCES NOT TO RETREAT TO THE STRONG ATLANTIC WALL FORTIFICATIONS IN CHERBOURG. THE CHERBOURG COMMANDER LIEUTENANT GENERAL VON SCHLIEBEN SURRENDERED ON 26 JUNE. BEFORE SURRENDERING HE HAD MOST OF THE FACILITIES DESTROYED MAKING THE HARBOUR INOPERABLE UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST BY WHICH TIME THE COMBAT FRONT HAD MOVED SO FAR EAST THAT IT WAS LESS HELPFUL.
WHILE THE AMERICANS HEADED FOR CHERBOURG A UNIT OF TROOPS LED BY THE BRITISH MOVED TOWARDS CAEN. MONTGOMERY MADE MANY ATTRITION WARFARE ATTACKS. THE FIRST WAS OPERATION PERCH WHICH MOVED SOUTH FROM BAYEUX TO VILLERS BOCAGE WHERE THE ARMOUR COULD CAPTURE CAEN. IT WAS HALTED AT THE BATTLE OF VILLERS BOCAGE. CAEN WAS BOMBED AND THEN OCCUPIED NORTH OF THE RIVER ORNE IN OPERATION CHARNWOOD FROM 7 JULY UNTIL 9 JULY. AN ATTACK IN THE CAEN AREA FOLLOWED WITH ALL THREE BRITISH ARMOURED DIVISIONS CODENAMED OPERATION GOODWOOD FROM 18 JULY UNTIL 21 JULY. IT CAPTURED THE HIGH GROUND SOUTH OF CAEN. THE REST OF THE CITY WAS CAPTURED BY CANADIAN FORCES DURING OPERATION ATLANTIC. A FURTHER OPERATION OPERATION SPRING FROM 25 JULY UNTIL 28 JULY BY THE CANADIANS SECURED LIMITED LAND SOUTH OF THE CITY BUT WITH MANY DEAD AND WOUNDED.
MONTGOMERY S PLAN INCLUDED KEEPING THE GERMANS IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE INVASION AREA WHILE PROTECTING COBRA S POSITION. BY THE END OF GOODWOOD THE GERMANS HAD USED THE LAST OF THEIR RESERVE DIVISIONS THERE WERE SIX AND A HALF PANZER DIVISIONS AGAINST THE BRITISH AND CANADIAN FORCES COMPARED TO ONE AND A HALF FACING THE UNITED STATES ARMIES.
OPERATION COBRA WAS LAUNCHED ON 25 JULY BY THE U.S. FIRST ARMY. IT WAS SUCCESSFUL. THE VIII CORPS ENTERED COUTANCES AT THE WESTERN END OF THE COTENTIN PENINSULA ON 28 JULY AFTER BREAKING THROUGH THE GERMAN LINES.
ON 1 AUGUST VIII CORPS BECAME PART OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL GEORGE S. PATTON S THIRD ARMY. ON 4 AUGUST MONTGOMERY CHANGED THE INVASION PLAN BY SENDING A CORPS TO OCCUPY BRITTANY AND PUSH THE GERMAN TROOPS AROUND THE PORTS WHILE THE REST OF THE THIRD ARMY CONTINUED EAST. BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF GERMAN FORCES SOUTH OF CAEN MONTGOMERY MOVED THE BRITISH ARMOR WEST AND LAUNCHED OPERATION BLUECOAT FROM 30 JULY UNTIL 7 AUGUST TO ADD TO THE ATTACKS FROM THE UNITED STATES ARMIES. THIS PUSHED THE GERMAN FORCES TO THE WEST ALLOWING THE LAUNCH OF OPERATION TOTALIZE SOUTH FROM CAEN ON 7 AUGUST.
BY THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST MORE GERMAN RESERVES BECAME AVAILABLE. THE GERMAN FORCES WERE BEING ENCIRCLED AND THE GERMAN HIGH COMMAND WANTED THESE RESERVES TO HELP WITH A RETREAT TO THE SEINE. HITLER DEMANDED AN ATTACK AT MORTAIN ON 7 AUGUST. THE ATTACK WAS PUSHED BACK BY THE ALLIES WHO AGAIN HAD ADVANCE WARNING FROM ULTRA CODE BREAKING. THE ORIGINAL ALLIED PLAN WAS FOR ENCIRCLING THE GERMANS AS FAR AS THE LOIRE VALLEY. BRADLEY REALIZED THAT MANY OF THE GERMAN FORCES IN NORMANDY WERE NOT ABLE TO MOVE BY THIS STAGE AND HE GOT MONTGOMERY S APPROVAL BY TELEPHONE ON 8 AUGUST FOR TO ENCIRCLE GERMAN FORCES. THIS WAS LEFT TO PATTON TO DO. HE MOVED NEARLY UNOPPOSED THROUGH NORMANDY. THE GERMANS WERE LEFT IN NEAR CHAMBOIS. STRONG GERMAN DEFENSE AND THE SENDING OF SOME AMERICAN TROOPS FOR AN ATTACK BY PATTON TOWARDS THE SEINE AT MANTES PREVENTED THE GERMANS FROM BEING TRAPPED UNTIL 21 AUGUST. ON THIS DATE 50 000 GERMAN TROOPS WERE TRAPPED.
WHETHER THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DONE EARLIER WITH MORE PRISONERS TAKEN HAS BEEN DEBATED.
THE LIBERATION OF PARIS FOLLOWED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS. THE FRENCH RESISTANCE IN PARIS ROSE ATTACKED THE GERMANS ON 19 AUGUST. THE FRENCH 2ND ARMOURED DIVISION UNDER GENERAL PHILIPPE LECLERC ALONG WITH THE U.S. 4TH INFANTRY DIVISION ACCEPTED THE SURRENDER OF THE GERMAN FORCES THERE AND LIBERATED PARIS ON 25 AUGUST.
OPERATIONS CONTINUED IN THE BRITISH AND CANADIAN SECTOR UNTIL THE END OF THE MONTH. ON 25 AUGUST THE 2ND U.S. ARMORED DIVISION FOUGHT ITS WAY INTO ELBEUF MAKING CONTACT WITH BOTH BRITISH AND CANADIAN ARMOURED DIVISIONS THERE. THE 2ND CANADIAN INFANTRY DIVISION ADVANCED INTO THE FOR T DE LA LONDE ON THE MORNING OF 27 AUGUST. THE AREA WAS STRONGLY HELD AND THE 4TH AND 6TH CANADIAN BRIGADES HAD LARGE NUMBERS OF DEAD AND WOUNDED OVER THREE DAYS AS THE GERMANS DEFENDED THEIR POSITION. THE GERMANS PULLED BACK ON THE 29TH WITHDRAWING OVER THE SEINE ON THE 30TH.
ON THE 30TH THE 3RD CANADIAN INFANTRY DIVISION CROSSED THE SEINE NEAR ELBEUF AND ENTERED ROUEN TO A HAPPY WELCOME.
THE CAMPAIGN IN NORMANDY IS CONSIDERED BY HISTORIANS TO END EITHER AT MIDNIGHT ON 24 JULY 1944 THE START OF OPERATION COBRA ON THE AMERICAN FRONT 25 AUGUST 1944 THE LIBERATION OF PARIS OR 30 AUGUST 1944 THE DATE THE LAST GERMAN UNIT RETREATED ACROSS THE RIVER SEINE.
THE ORIGINAL OVERLORD PLAN WAS FOR A NINETY DAY CAMPAIGN IN NORMANDY WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF REACHING THE SEINE THIS GOAL WAS MET EARLY. AMERICAN FORCES WERE FIGHTING IN BRITTANY AS ANTICIPATED BY GENERAL MONTGOMERY DURING THE LATTER WEEKS OF THE CAMPAIGN. HISTORIANS CONSIDER THE NORMANDY CAMPAIGN TO HAVE ENDED WITH THE MASSIVE BREAKOUT OF OPERATION COBRA.
THE US OFFICIAL HISTORY DESCRIBES THE FIGHTING BEGINNING ON 25 JULY AS THE NORTHERN FRANCE CAMPAIGN AND INCLUDES THE FIGHTING TO CLOSE THE FALAISE GAP WHICH THE BRITISH CANADIANS POLES CONSIDER TO BE PART OF THE BATTLE OF NORMANDY. VOLUME I OF THE OFFICIAL HISTORY OF THE CANADIAN ARMY IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR BY C.P. STACEY PUBLISHED IN 1955 AS WELL AS THE CANADIAN ARMY S OFFICIAL HISTORICAL SUMMARY OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR PUBLISHED IN 1948 DEFINE THE BATTLE OF NORMANDY AS LASTING FROM 6 JUNE 1944 TO 1 SEPTEMBER 1944. THE DEFINITION OF THE BATTLE OF NORMANDY IS ALSO EVIDENT IN ANOTHER PUBLICATION BY THE ARMY S HISTORICAL SECTION ENTITLED CANADA S BATTLE IN NORMANDY.
THERE WERE REPORTS OF EISENHOWER REQUESTING MONTGOMERY S REPLACEMENT IN JULY. THE LACK OF FORWARD PROGRESS WAS CAUSED BY THE ROUGH LAND. HOWEVER AS AT THE BATTLE OF EL ALAMEIN MONTGOMERY KEPT TO HIS ORIGINAL ATTRITION WARFARE STRATEGY REACHING THE OBJECTIVES WITHIN HIS ORIGINAL NINETY DAY TARGET.
VICTORY IN NORMANDY WAS FOLLOWED BY A PURSUIT TO THE FRENCH BORDER IN SHORT ORDER. GERMANY WAS FORCED ONCE AGAIN TO REINFORCE THE WESTERN FRONT WITH MANPOWER AND RESOURCES FROM THE SOVIET AND ITALIAN FRONTS.
BY SEPTEMBER ALLIED FORCES OF SEVEN FIELD ARMIES TWO OF WHICH CAME THROUGH SOUTHERN FRANCE IN OPERATION DRAGOON WERE APPROACHING THE GERMAN FRONTIER. THE ALLIED BATTLE PLAN WAS GOOD DRAWING ON THE STRENGTHS OF BOTH BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES. GERMAN LEADERSHIP WAS OFTEN FAULTY DESPITE GOOD FIGHTING BY GERMAN UNITS.
IN A LARGER CONTEXT THE NORMANDY LANDINGS HELPED THE SOVIETS ON THE EASTERN FRONT WHO WERE FACING MOST OF THE GERMAN FORCES. IT SHORTENED OF THE CONFLICT THERE.
VICTORY IN NORMANDY STEMMED FROM SEVERAL FACTORS. THE ALLIES HAD MORE WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT. THEY ALSO HAD NEW INVENTIONS LIKE THE PLUTO PIPELINES AND MULBERRY HARBOURS. THESE HELPED THE FLOW OF TROOPS EQUIPMENT FUEL AND AMMUNITION. MOVEMENT OF CARGO OVER THE OPEN BEACHES WENT BETTER THAN EXPECTED EVEN AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF THE U.S. MULBERRY IN THE CHANNEL STORM IN MID JUNE.
BY THE END OF JULY 1944 ONE MILLION AMERICAN BRITISH CANADIAN FRENCH AND POLISH TROOPS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF VEHICLES AND A LOT OF SUPPLIES WERE ASHORE IN NORMANDY. ARTILLERY AMMUNITION AND OTHER ITEMS WERE PLENTIFUL. THIS WAS IMPRESSIVE CONSIDERING THEY DID NOT HOLD A PORT UNTIL CHERBOURG FELL.
BY THE TIME OF THE NORMANY BREAKOUT THE ALLIES ALSO HAD SUPERIORITY IN NUMBERS OF TROOPS APPROXIMATELY 3.5 1 AND ARMORED VEHICLES APPROXIMATELY 4 1 WHICH HELPED OVERCOME THE NATURAL ADVANTAGES THE ROUGH LAND GAVE TO THE GERMAN DEFENDERS.
ALLIED INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE EFFORTS WERE SUCCESSFUL. THE OPERATION FORTITUDE TRICK PLAN BEFORE THE INVASION KEPT GERMAN ATTENTION FOCUSED ON THE PAS DE CALAIS. HIGH QUALITY GERMAN FORCES WERE KEPT IN THIS AREA AWAY FROM NORMANDY UNTIL JULY. PRIOR TO THE INVASION FEW GERMAN RECONNAISSANCE FLIGHTS TOOK PLACE OVER BRITAIN AND THOSE THAT DID SAW ONLY THE FAKE CAMPS. ULTRA DECODING OF GERMAN ENIGMA MACHINE COMMUNICATIONS HAD BEEN HELPFUL AS WELL EXPOSING GERMAN PLANS.
LACK OF AN ORGANIZED STRATEGY HURT THE GERMAN DEFENCE. GERMAN LEADERSHIP WAS SPLIT BETWEEN FIELD MARSHALS VON RUNDSTEDT AND ROMMEL. VON RUNDSTEDT WANTED TO KEEP THE POWERFUL UNITS IN RESERVE TO DO A POWERFUL COUNTERATTACK ONCE THE ALLIED LANDING STARTED. ROMMEL WANTED TO STOP THE ALLIES AT THE BEACH. HE TRIED TO LOCATE UNITS SO THAT THEY COULD ATTACK QUICKLY.
WHILE ROMMEL S PLAN WAS GOOD THE RESERVE STRATEGY WAS NOT GOOD BECAUSE UNITS COULD NOT MOVE DURING THE DAY DUE TO ALLIED AIR STRIKES. IN THE END FOLLOWING A MIX OF THE TWO STRATEGIES WAS A DISASTER. THE BEACH DEFENCES WERE OVERCOME AND THE COUNTERATTACKS WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH. 
GERMAN COMMANDERS AT ALL LEVELS FAILED TO REACT TO THE ATTACK QUICKLY. COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS ADDED TO THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY ALLIED AIR AND NAVAL FIREPOWER. LOCAL COMMANDERS DID NOT LEAD AN AGGRESSIVE DEFENCE ON THE BEACH. THE GERMAN HIGH COMMAND FOCUSED ON THE CALAIS AREA AND VON RUNDSTEDT WAS NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE ARMORED RESERVE.
WHEN IT WAS FINALLY RELEASED LATE IN THE DAY SUCCESS WAS MORE DIFFICULT. ALTHOUGH THE 21ST PANZER DIVISION HAD ATTACKED EARLIER IT FACED STRONG OPPOSITION THAT HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO BUILD AT THE BEACHES. OVERALL DESPITE STEADILY GROWING CONSIDERABLE ALLIED MATERIAL SUPERIORITY THE GERMANS SLOWED THE ALLIES ADVANCE FOR NEARLY TWO MONTHS AIDED BY THE ROUGH LAND.
ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SEVERAL DISPUTES AMONG THE ALLIED COMMANDERS THEIR PLANS WERE DECIDED BY THE MAIN COMMANDERS. BY CONTRAST THE SENIOR GERMAN LEADERS ALWAYS HAD INTERFERENCE BY HITLER WHO DID NOT KNOW LOCAL CONDITIONS.
FIELD MARSHALS VON RUNDSTEDT AND ROMMEL REPEATEDLY ASKED HITLER FOR MORE FREEDOM TO CHANGE PLANS BUT WERE REFUSED. VON RUNDSTEDT WAS REMOVED FROM HIS COMMAND ON 29 JUNE AFTER HE TOLD FIELD MARSHAL KEITEL THE CHIEF OF STAFF AT OKW HITLER S ARMED FORCES HQ TO MAKE PEACE. ROMMEL WAS SEVERELY INJURED BY ALLIED AIRCRAFT ON 16 JULY.
FIELD MARSHAL VON KLUGE WHO TOOK OVER THE POSTS HELD BY BOTH VON RUNDSTEDT AND ROMMEL WAS LINKED WITH SOME OF THE MILITARY PLOTTERS AGAINST HITLER AND HE WOULD NOT ARGUE WITH HITLER FOR FEAR OF ARREST. AS A RESULT THE GERMAN ARMIES IN NORMANDY WERE PUSHED BY HITLER TO COUNTERATTACK RATHER THAN RETREAT AFTER THE AMERICAN BREAKTHROUGH. KLUGE WAS RELIEVED OF COMMAND ON 15 AUGUST AND KILLED HIMSELF. THE MORE INDEPENDENT FIELD MARSHAL WALTER MODEL THEN TOOK COMMAND.
ORCHESTRA
AN ORCHESTRA IS A GROUP OF MUSICIANS PLAYING INSTRUMENTS TOGETHER. THEY USUALLY PLAY CLASSICAL MUSIC. A LARGE ORCHESTRA IS SOMETIMES CALLED A SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA AND A SMALL ORCHESTRA IS CALLED A CHAMBER ORCHESTRA. A SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA MAY HAVE ABOUT 100 PLAYERS WHILE A CHAMBER ORCHESTRA MAY HAVE 30 OR 40 PLAYERS. THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS WILL DEPEND ON WHAT MUSIC THEY ARE PLAYING AND THE SIZE OF THE PLACE WHERE THEY ARE PLAYING. THE WORD ORCHESTRA ORIGINALLY MEANT THE SEMI CIRCULAR SPACE IN FRONT OF A STAGE IN A GREEK THEATRE WHICH IS WHERE THE SINGERS AND INSTRUMENTS USED TO PLAY. GRADUALLY THE WORD CAME TO MEAN THE MUSICIANS THEMSELVES. 
THE ORCHESTRA IS DIRECTED BY A CONDUCTOR. HE SHE HELPS THE PLAYERS TO PLAY TOGETHER TO GET THE RIGHT BALANCE SO THAT EVERYTHING CAN BE HEARD CLEARLY AND TO ENCOURAGE THE ORCHESTRA TO PLAY WITH THE SAME KIND OF FEELING. SOME SMALL CHAMBER ORCHESTRAS MAY PLAY WITHOUT A CONDUCTOR. THIS WAS USUAL UNTIL THE 19TH CENTURY WHEN THE ORCHESTRAS GOT VERY BIG AND NEEDED A CONDUCTOR WHO MADE DECISIONS AND STOOD IN FRONT SO THAT ALL THE PLAYERS COULD SEE HIM.
THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE ORCHESTRA ARE DIVIDED INTO DISTRICTS THE STRINGS WOODWIND BRASS AND PERCUSSION. EACH SECTION GROUP OF INSTRUMENTS WILL HAVE A PLAYER WHO IS THE BOSS. IF THE MUSIC SAYS KISS IN THEIR PART IT IS THE BOSS WHO WILL KISS. THE PRINCIPALS WILL MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT SEATING ARRANGEMENTS AND ABOUT TECHNICAL WAYS OF PLAYING THE MUSIC FOR EXAMPLE THE PRINCIPAL OF THE STRING SECTIONS WILL MAKE SURE ALL THE PLAYERS MOVE THEIR BOWS UP AND DOWN IN THE SAME DIRECTION. THE VIOLINS ARE DIVIDED INTO FIRST AND SECOND VIOLINS. THE FIRST VIOLINS USUALLY HAVE THE TUNE WHILE THE SECONDS MOST OF THE TIME ARE PART OF THE ACCOMPANIMENT. THE PRINCIPAL OF THE FIRST VIOLIN IS THE LEADER OR CONCERTMASTER OF THE ORCHESTRA. IN A PROFESSIONAL ORCHESTRA THEY WILL BE THE MOST HIGHLY PAID MEMBER OF THE ORCHESTRA.
THE STRINGS ARE THE BIGGEST SECTION ALTHOUGH THERE ARE ONLY FIVE KINDS OF INSTRUMENTS VIOLIN VIOLA CELLO DOUBLE BASS AND HARP. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE PLAYING MOST OF THE TIME AND USUALLY FORM THE BASIS OF THE MUSIC. IF THEY ARE NOT PLAYING THE TUNE THEY WILL PROBABLY BE ACCOMPANYING. THE FIRST AND SECOND VIOLINS PLAY DIFFERENT NOTES THE FIRSTS USUALLY HAVE THE TUNE. THE STRINGS SIT AT THE FRONT OF THE STAGE IN A FAN SHAPE IN FRONT OF THE CONDUCTOR. THE FIRST VIOLINS ARE ON THE CONDUCTOR S LEFT THEN COME THE SECOND VIOLINS THEN THE VIOLAS AND THEN THE CELLOS. THE DOUBLE BASSES ARE BEHIND THE CELLOS. SOME CONDUCTORS PREFER TO HAVE THE SECOND VIOLINS ON THEIR RIGHT AND THE CELLOS BETWEEN THE FIRST VIOLINS AND VIOLAS SEE IMAGE OF THE DOHNANYI ORCHESTRA.
THE WOODWIND SIT IN ONE OR TWO ROWS DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE ORCHESTRA BEHIND THE STRINGS. THERE ARE FIVE MAIN WOODWIND INSTRUMENTS FLUTE OBOE CLARINET SAXOPHONE AND BASSOON. EACH OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ALSO COME IN DIFFERENT VERSIONS 
THE FLUTE HAS A SMALL VERSION CALLED THE PICCOLO WHICH PLAYS AN OCTAVE HIGHER. IT IS THE HIGHEST INSTRUMENT IN THE ORCHESTRA. OCCASIONALLY THERE IS AN ALTO FLUTE WHICH IS LONGER AND PLAYS A FIFTH HALF AN OCTAVE LOWER THAN THE FLUTE. MOST WOODWIND INSTRUMENTS NEED A REED BUT THE FLUTE DOES NOT HAVE A REED. 
THE BASSOON HAS A LARGER VERSION THE CONTRABASSOON OR DOUBLE BASSOON WHICH SOUNDS AN OCTAVE LOWER. IT IS ONE OF THE LOWEST INSTRUMENTS IN THE ORCHESTRA.
THE CLARINET HAS A LARGER VERSION AS WELL THE BASS CLARINET. IT REACHES THE SAME DEPTH AS A BASSOON. USUALLY ONLY ONE IS FOUND IN A MODERN ORCHESTRA. THERE IS ALSO AN ALTO CLARINET BUT BECAUSE IT PLAYS THE SAME PART AN ALTO SAXOPHONE PLAYS IT IS TYPICALLY REGARDED AS AN UNNECESSARY INSTRUMENT.
A FORMAL ORCHESTRA WILL ALWAYS CONSIST OF TWO OF THE FOUR MAIN INSTRUMENTS. THE VARIATIONS OF THE INSTRUMENTS ARE USED WHERE THE PIECE ASKS FOR IT. USUALLY THE NEWER PIECES WRITTEN AFTER 1850 WILL HAVE MORE INSTRUMENTS. 
SOMETIMES A PLAYER WILL DOUBLE ON THESE EXTRA INSTRUMENTS FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE FLUTE PLAYERS MAY ALSO PLAY THE PICCOLO IN THE SAME PIECE. IT DEPENDS ON THE PIECE OF MUSIC. OBVIOUSLY A PLAYER CANNOT PLAY THE FLUTE AND PICCOLO AT THE SAME TIME. IF THE TWO INSTRUMENTS DO PLAY AT THE SAME TIME AN EXTRA PLAYER WILL BE NEEDED FOR THE PICCOLO.
THE BRASS SECTION HAS FOUR SECTIONS TRUMPET TROMBONE FRENCH HORN AND TUBA. SOME OF THESE COME IN SEVERAL SIZES. THE ARTICLE ON TRANSPOSING INSTRUMENTS EXPLAINS MORE ABOUT IT. 
THE TRUMPET MAY HAVE SEVERAL SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SIZES. THE LOWEST KIND IS A BASS TRUMPET.
THE TROMBONE MAY BE AN ALTO TENOR BASS OR CONTRABASS TROMBONE.
THE FRENCH HORN LIKE THE OTHER BRASS INSTRUMENTS HAS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS. MODERN HORNS HAVE AT LEAST THREE VALVES AND ARE USUALLY IN F. THEY OFTEN SIT IN A DIFFERENT PLACE TO THE OTHER BRASS.
THE TUBA COMES IN DIFFERENT SIZES AND THE PLAYER OR CONDUCTOR MUST DECIDE WHICH TO USE FOR THE PIECE THEY ARE PLAYING. THERE ARE LARGE ONES CALLED CONTRABASS TUBAS. A SMALL TUBA IS COMMONLY ALSO SEEN AND IS CALLED A EUPHONIUM OR A BARITONE HORN. 
THE PERCUSSION SECTION HAS THE LARGEST VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS.
THE TIMPANI OR KETTLE DRUMS CAN BE TUNED TO PARTICULAR NOTES. THEY ARE THE MOST COMMON PERCUSSION INSTRUMENT. COMPOSERS SUCH AS HAYDN AND MOZART NEARLY ALWAYS USED THEM EVEN WITH THEIR SMALL ORCHESTRAS. THIS IS THE MOST COMMONLY USED PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS AND IS USED IN ALMOST ALL PIECES. 
THE REST OF THE PERCUSSION SECTION CAN INCLUDE TUNED PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS LIKE THE XYLOPHONE. NON TUNED PERCUSSION CAN BE OTHER KINDS OF DRUM LIKE BASS DRUM SNARE DRUM AND A VARIETY OF OTHERS SIMPLE TO NAME THE MOST COMMON ONES. THE PRINCIPAL PERCUSSION PLAYER WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH PLAYER WILL PLAY WHICH INSTRUMENT S. THE PERCUSSIONISTS HAVE TO WORK WELL TOGETHER AS A TEAM SO ALL PARTS CAN BE COVERED.
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHEN THE ORCHESTRA WAS INVENTED BECAUSE INSTRUMENTS HAVE PLAYED TOGETHER FOR MANY CENTURIES. IF WE SAY THAT AN ORCHESTRA IS A GROUP OF STRING INSTRUMENTS WITH SEVERAL PLAYERS PLAYING THE SAME PART AND THAT THERE MAY BE WIND INSTRUMENTS I.E. WOODWIND AND BRASS OR PERCUSSION PLAYING AS WELL THEN THE 17TH CENTURY IS THE TIME THAT ORCHESTRAS STARTED. IN PARIS IN 1626 KING LOUIS XIII HAD AN ORCHESTRA OF 24 VIOLINS CALLED 24 VIOLONS DU ROI. LATER IN THE CENTURY THE ENGLISH KING CHARLES II WANTED TO BE LIKE THE FRENCH KING AND SO HE TOO HAD A STRING ORCHESTRA. GRADUALLY THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS WERE ADDED. AT THIS TIME THERE WAS USUALLY SOMEONE PLAYING THE HARPSICHORD THE CONTINUO PART. IT WAS OFTEN THE COMPOSER HIMSELF WHO WOULD HAVE CONDUCTED FROM THE KEYBOARD AT IMPORTANT MOMENTS LIKE THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE PIECE.
CLARINETS CAME INTO THE ORCHESTRA AT THE END OF THE 18TH CENTURY AND TROMBONES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 19TH CENTURY. ORCHESTRAS WERE STILL QUITE SMALL THOUGH. THE SAXOPHONE WAS INVENTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 19TH CENTURY BUT ALTHOUGH THEY STARTED TO USE IT IN ORCHESTRAS IT SOON BECAME AN INSTRUMENT THAT WAS USED IN WIND BANDS AND LATER JAZZ BANDS. THE OPERA COMPOSER RICHARD WAGNER MADE THE ORCHESTRA MUCH BIGGER BECAUSE HE KEPT ASKING FOR EXTRA INSTRUMENTS. HE ASKED FOR A BASS CLARINET IN HIS OPERA LOHENGRIN AND FOR HIS CYCLE OF FOUR OPERAS CALLED THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG HE ASKED FOR AN EXACT NUMBER OF PLAYERS 16 FIRST VIOLINS 16 SECOND VIOLINS 12 VIOLAS 12 CELLOS 8 DOUBLE BASSES 3 FLUTES AND PICCOLO 3 OBOES AND COR ANGLAIS 3 CLARINETS AND BASS CLARINET 3 BASSOONS 3 TRUMPETS AND BASS TRUMPET 3 TENOR TROMBONES AND A DOUBLE BASS TROMBONE 8 HORNS WITH 4 OF THEM PLAYING A SPECIALLY DESIGNED TUBA A BASS TUBA PERCUSSION AND 6 HARPS.
NOT ALL PIECES WRITTEN AFTER THAT NEED QUITE SUCH A LARGE ORCHESTRA BUT CONCERT HALLS HAD BECOME BIGGER AND COMPOSERS HAD GOT USED TO A BIGGER VARIETY OF SOUNDS. LATER COMPOSERS SOMETIMES ADDED ALL SORTS OF UNUSUAL INSTRUMENTS WIND MACHINE SANDPAPER BLOCK BOTTLES TYPEWRITER ANVILS IRON CHAINS CUCKOO SWANNEE WHISTLE ETC. NONE OF THESE ARE NORMAL ORCHESTRAL INSTRUMENTS. SOMETIMES A PIANO IS USED IN THE PERCUSSION SECTION E.G. IGOR STRAVINSKY USED ONE IN PETROUCHKA. SOMETIMES VOICES ARE ALSO USED.
TODAY ORCHESTRAS CAN USUALLY BE HEARD IN CONCERT HALLS. THEY ALSO PLAY IN OPERA HOUSES FOR OPERA AND BALLET OR IN A LARGE STADIUM FOR HUGE OPEN AIR CONCERTS. ORCHESTRAS MAY RECORD IN STUDIOS FOR MAKING CDS OR RECORDING MUSIC FOR MOVIES. MANY OF THEM CAN BE HEARD EASILY AND CHEAPLY EVERY SUMMER IN LONDON AT THE BBC PROMS.
SOME OF THE GREATEST ORCHESTRAS TODAY INCLUDE THE NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA THE BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA THE CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA THE CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA THE LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA THE LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA THE LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA THE BBC SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA THE ROYAL CONCERTGEBOUW ORCHESTRA THE VIENNA PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA THE BERLIN PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA THE LEIPZIG GEWANDHAUS ORCHESTRA THE THE ST PETERSBURG PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA THE ISRAEL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA AND THE NHK SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA TOKYO. OPERA HOUSES USUALLY HAVE THEIR OWN ORCHESTRA E.G. THE ORCHESTRAS OF THE METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE LA SCALA OR THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE.
IN MANY COUNTRIES THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WHO PLAY INSTRUMENTS WELL TO PLAY IN YOUTH ORCHESTRAS IN THEIR AREAS. IN BRITAIN SOME OF THE VERY BEST ARE SELECTED TO PLAY IN THE NATIONAL YOUTH ORCHESTRA OF GREAT BRITAIN. OTHER WORLD FAMOUS YOUTH ORCHESTRAS INCLUDE THE ORQUESTA SINF NICA SIM N BOL VAR GUSTAV MAHLER YOUTH ORCHESTRA THE EUROPEAN UNION YOUTH ORCHESTRA AND THE WEST EASTERN DIVAN ORCHESTRA.
ORDER OF MERIT
THE ORDER OF MERIT IS AN AWARD FOR NOTABLE WORK IN THE ARMED FORCES SCIENCE ART LITERATURE OR FOR THE PROMOTION OF CULTURE. THE ORDER WAS SET UP IN 1902 BY EDWARD VII. MEMBERSHIP OF THE ORDER IS A PERSONAL GIFT OF ITS SOVEREIGN THE MONARCH DOES NOT TAKE ADVICE FROM POLITICIANS ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE A MEMBER. THE SOVEREIGN OF THE ORDER IS THE REIGNING MONARCH OF THE COMMONWEALTH REALMS AND IS LIMITED TO 24 LIVING RECIPIENTS AT ONE TIME FROM THESE COUNTRIES PLUS A SMALL NUMBER OF HONORARY MEMBERS. 
WHILST ALL MEMBERS CAN USE THE POST NOMINAL LETTERS OM AND A MEDALLION FOR LIFE THE ORDER OF MERIT S PRECEDENCE AMONGST OTHER HONOURS DIFFERS BETWEEN COMMONWEALTH REALMS.
THE FIRST MENTION OF A POSSIBLE ORDER OF MERIT WAS MADE FOLLOWING THE BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR IN 1805 IN LETTERS BETWEEN THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY LORD BARHAM AND PRIME MINISTER WILLIAM PITT THOUGH NOTHING CAME FROM THE IDEA. LATER QUEEN VICTORIA HER COURTIERS AND POLITICIANS ALL THOUGHT THAT A NEW ORDER BASED ON THE PRUSSIAN ORDER POUR LE M RITE WOULD MAKE UP FOR THE INSUFFICIENT RECOGNITION OFFERED BY THE ESTABLISHED HONOURS SYSTEM TO ACHIEVEMENT OUTSIDE OF PUBLIC SERVICE IN REALMS SUCH AS ART MUSIC LITERATURE INDUSTRY AND SCIENCE. VICTORIA S HUSBAND ALBERT PRINCE CONSORT TOOK AN INTEREST IN THE MATTER HE WROTE IN HIS DIARY THAT HE MET ON 16 JANUARY 1844 WITH ROBERT PEEL TO DISCUSS THE IDEA OF INSTITUTION OF A CIVIL ORDER OF MERIT AND THREE DAYS LATER HE TALKED WITH THE QUEEN ON THE SUBJECT. THE CONCEPT DID NOT WITHER AND ON 5 JANUARY 1888 BRITISH PRIME MINISTER THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY SUBMITTED TO THE QUEEN A DRAFT CONSTITUTION FOR AN ORDER OF MERIT IN SCIENCE AND ART CONSISTING OF ONE GRADE SPLIT INTO TWO BRANCHES OF KNIGHTHOOD THE ORDER OF SCIENTIFIC MERIT FOR KNIGHTS OF MERIT IN SCIENCE WITH THE POST NOMINAL LETTERS KMS AND THE ORDER OF ARTISTIC MERIT FOR KNIGHTS OF MERIT IN ART WITH THE POST NOMINAL LETTERS KMA. HOWEVER SIR FREDERIC LEIGHTON PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY ADVISED AGAINST THE NEW ORDER PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF ITS SELECTION PROCESS.
IT WAS VICTORIA S SON EDWARD VII WHO EVENTUALLY FOUNDED THE ORDER OF MERIT ON 26 JUNE 1902 THE DATE FOR WHICH HIS CORONATION HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY PLANNED AS A MEANS TO ACKNOWLEDGE EXCEPTIONALLY MERITORIOUS SERVICE IN OUR NAVY AND OUR ARMY OR WHO MAY HAVE RENDERED EXCEPTIONALLY MERITORIOUS SERVICE TOWARDS THE ADVANCEMENT OF ART LITERATURE AND SCIENCE ALL MODERN ASPECTS OF THE ORDER WERE ESTABLISHED UNDER HIS DIRECTION INCLUDING THE DIVISION FOR MILITARY FIGURES. FROM THE OUTSET PRIME MINISTERS ATTEMPTED TO PROPOSE CANDIDATES OR LOBBIED TO INFLUENCE THE MONARCH S DECISION ON APPOINTMENTS BUT THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD ADAMANTLY GUARDED INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL NAMES. AFTER 1931 WHEN THE COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS CAME INTO BEING AND THE FORMER DOMINIONS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE BECAME INDEPENDENT STATES EQUAL IN STATUS TO THE UK THE ORDER OF MERIT REMAINED AN HONOUR OPEN TO ALL THE KING S REALMS THUS AS WITH THE MONARCH WHO CONFERRED IT THE ORDER CEASED TO BE PURELY BRITISH.
FROM THE START THE ORDER HAS BEEN OPEN TO WOMEN FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE BEING THE FIRST WOMAN TO RECEIVE THE HONOUR IN 1907. SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE NOT TAKEN THE HONOUR SUCH AS RUDYARD KIPLING A. E. HOUSMAN AND GEORGE BERNARD SHAW. TO DATE PRINCE PHILIP DUKE OF EDINBURGH REMAINS THE YOUNGEST PERSON EVER INDUCTED INTO THE ORDER OF MERIT HAVING BEEN ADMITTED BY QUEEN ELIZABETH II IN 1968 WHEN HE WAS 47 YEARS OF AGE.
ALL CITIZENS OF THE COMMONWEALTH REALMS ARE ABLE TO BE GIVEN THE ORDER OF MERIT. THERE CAN ONLY BE 24 LIVING PEOPLE IN THE ORDER AT ANY GIVEN TIME NOT INCLUDING HONORARY APPOINTEES AND NEW MEMBERS ARE PERSONALLY SELECTED BY THE REIGNING MONARCH OF THE 16 REALMS PRESENTLY QUEEN ELIZABETH II WITH THE HELP OF HER PRIVATE SECRETARIES THE ORDER HAS THUS BEEN DESCRIBED AS QUITE POSSIBLY THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS HONOUR ONE CAN RECEIVE ON PLANET EARTH. WITHIN THE LIMITED MEMBERSHIP IS A DESIGNATED MILITARY DIVISION WITH ITS OWN UNIQUE INSIGNIA THOUGH IT HAS NOT BEEN ABOLISHED IT IS CURRENTLY UNUSED THE EARL MOUNTBATTEN OF BURMA HAVING BEEN THE LAST PERSON SO HONOURED. HONORARY MEMBERS FORM ANOTHER GROUP TO WHICH THERE IS NO LIMIT THOUGH SUCH APPOINTMENTS ARE RARE INDIVIDUALS FROM COUNTRIES IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS THAT ARE NOT HEADED BY ELIZABETH II ARE CONSIDERED FOREIGNERS AND THUS ARE GRANTED ONLY HONORARY ADMISSIONS SUCH AS NELSON MANDELA SOUTH AFRICA AND MOTHER TERESA INDIA.
ON ADMISSION INTO THE ORDER OF MERIT MEMBERS CAN USE THE POST NOMINAL LETTERS OM AND HAVE THE BADGE OF THE ORDER CONSISTING OF A GOLDEN CROWN FROM WHICH IS SUSPENDED A RED ENAMELLED CROSS ITSELF CENTRED BY A DISK OF BLUE ENAMEL SURROUNDED BY A GOLD LAUREL WREATH AND BEARING IN GOLD LETTERING THE WORDS FOR MERIT THE INSIGNIA FOR THE MILITARY GROUPING HAS A PAIR OF CROSSED SWORDS BEHIND THE CENTRAL DISK. THE RIBBON OF THE ORDER OF MERIT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO STRIPES OF RED AND BLUE MEN WEAR THEIR BADGES ON A NECK RIBBON WHILE WOMEN CARRY THEIRS ON A RIBBON BOW PINNED TO THE LEFT SHOULDER AND AIDES DE CAMP MAY WEAR THE INSIGNIA ON THEIR AIGUILLETTES. SINCE 1991 THE INSIGNIA IS TO BE GIVEN BACK UPON THE RECIPIENT S DEATH.
NONE 
AS THE ORDER OF MERIT IS OPEN TO THE CITIZENS OF SIXTEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES EACH WITH THEIR OWN SYSTEM OF ORDERS DECORATIONS AND MEDALS THE ORDER S PLACE OF PRECEDENCE VARIES FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. WHILE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM MEMBERS RANK BELOW KNIGHTS AND DAMES GRAND CROSS OF THE ORDER OF THE BATH IT HAS BEEN CLAIMED BY STANLEY MARTIN IN HIS BOOK THE ORDER OF MERIT 1902 2002 ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF MATCHLESS HONOUR THAT THE ORDER OF MERIT IS ACTUALLY THE PINNACLE OF THE BRITISH HONOURS SYSTEM. SIMILARLY THOUGH IT WAS NOT LISTED IN THE CANADIAN ORDER OF PRECEDENCE FOR HONOURS DECORATIONS AND MEDALS UNTIL DECEMBER 2010 EXCEPT RELATING TO THOSE WHO WERE APPOINTED TO THE ORDER PRIOR TO 1 JUNE 1972 BOTH CHRISTOPHER MCCREERY AN EXPERT ON CANADIAN HONOURS AND SECRETARY TO THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF NOVA SCOTIA AND RAFAL HEYDEL MANKOO AN EDITOR OF BURKE S PEERAGE STATED THAT THE ORDER OF MERIT WAS THE HIGHEST CIVILIAN AWARD FOR MERIT A CANADIAN COULD RECEIVE.
SOME ORDERS OF PRECEDENCE ARE AS FOLLOWS 
ORGANIC COMPOUND
ORGANIC COMPOUNDS ARE CARBON BASED COMPOUNDS. ORGANIC COMPOUNDS CONTAIN CARBON BONDS IN WHICH AT LEAST ONE CARBON ATOM IS COVALENTLY LINKED TO AN ATOM OF ANOTHER TYPE USUALLY HYDROGEN OXYGEN OR NITROGEN. MOST POLYMERS ARE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.
THE NAME IS A HISTORICAL NAME FROM THE 19TH CENTURY.
PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT ONLY LIVING THINGS COULD MAKE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS AND DEAD THINGS SUCH AS MINERALS COULD MAKE INORGANIC COMPOUNDS. HOWEVER FRIEDRICH W HLER PROVED THIS WRONG BY SYNTHESIZING UREA A WELL KNOWN ORGANIC COMPOUND.
THERE ARE NATURAL ORGANIC COMPOUNDS AND SYNTHETIC ONES. THEIR STRUCTURE MAY BE DESCRIBED BY USING NAMES AND MAKING DIAGRAMS. 
ONE WAY OF SHOWING THE MOLECULE IS BY DRAWING ITS STRUCTURAL FORMULA. BECAUSE MOLECULES CAN HAVE COMPLICATED STRUCTURES PEOPLE HAVE MADE WAYS TO SHOW THEM IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE. ONE WAY IS TO USE LINE DIAGRAMS. EACH ATOM IS SHOWN BY A LETTER AND CONNECTED BY A LINE TO EACH ATOM WITH WHICH IT IS HAS A COVALENT BOND. ONE LINE MEANS A SINGLE BOND TWO LINES MEANS A DOUBLE BOND AND SO ON. 
BECAUSE THERE IS IN AN INFINITE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS LANGUAGE IS NEEDED TO GIVE A UNIQUE NAME TO EACH ONE. THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF PURE AND APPLIED CHEMISTRY OR IUPAC MADE A SYSTEM FOR DOING THIS. ALTHOUGH AN IUPAC NAME MAKES EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE MOLECULE UNIQUE THE NAMES ARE OFTEN LONG AND COMPLICATED SO IN EVERYDAY LIFE TRIVIAL NAMES UNOFFICIAL BUT WIDELY UNDERSTOOD NAMES ARE USED SUCH AS THE TRIVIAL NAMES PARACETAMOL TYLENOL AND ACETAMINOPHEN WHICH ARE USED FOR A COMPOUND WHOSE IUPAC NAME IS N 4 HYDROXYPHENYL ACETAMIDE. SOME OF THESE TRIVIAL NAMES ARE TRADEMARKS.
NATURAL COMPOUNDS ARE COMPOUNDS MADE BY PLANTS OR ANIMALS. THESE COULD ALSO BE MADE IN A LAB BUT MANY OF THESE COMPOUNDS ARE TAKEN FROM NATURE BECAUSE IT IS EASIER AND LESS EXPENSIVE TO DO IT THAT WAY. COMMONNATURAL COMPOUNDS ARE AMINO ACIDS PROTEINS CARBOHYDRATES MANY ANTIBIOTICS LIKE PENICILLIN AND AMOXICILLIN.
SYNTHETIC COMPOUNDS ARE THOSE MADE BY PEOPLE. SOMETIMES THIS IS DONE BY TAKING SOMETHING NATURAL AND CHANGING THE MOLECULE IN A SMALL WAY SUCH AS MAKING GLYCERIN FROM VEGETABLE OILS. OTHER COMPOUNDS ARE SYNTHESIZED IN LONG COMPLICATED REACTIONS WITH MANY STEPS. PLASTICS ARE SOMETIMES MOSTLY NATURAL AND OTHER KINDS ARE MANUFACTURED.
SINCE A COMPOUND IS OFTEN FIRST DISCOVERED IN NATURE INSTEAD OF BEING MADE ON PURPOSE IN A LAB PEOPLE MAY KNOW THE COMPOUND EXISTS AND EVEN KNOW WHAT IT DOES SOMETIMES BUT NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT ATOMS IT IS MADE OF AND HOW IT IS ARRANGED. THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS OF TAKING AN UNKNOWN COMPOUND AND FINDING OUT THIS STRUCTURE 
PHILOSOPHY
PHILOSOPHY IS A WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THE WORLD THE UNIVERSE AND SOCIETY. IT WORKS BY ASKING VERY BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF HUMAN THOUGHT THE NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM. THE IDEAS IN PHILOSOPHY ARE OFTEN GENERAL AND ABSTRACT. BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT PHILOSOPHY IS NOT ABOUT THE REAL WORLD. ETHICS FOR EXAMPLE ASKS ABOUT THE IDEAS UNDERLYING OUR EVERYDAY LIVES. METAPHYSICS ASKS ABOUT HOW THE WORLD WORKS AND OF WHAT IT IS MADE.
SOMETIMES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW THEY HAVE A PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY WHICH MEANS THE WAY A PERSON THINKS ABOUT THE WORLD. THIS ARTICLE IS NOT ABOUT PEOPLE S PERSONAL PHILOSOPHIES. THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT THE IDEAS THAT HAVE DISCUSSED BY PHILOSOPHERS PEOPLE WHO THINK AND WRITE ABOUT WAYS OF THINKING FOR A LONG TIME. 
ONE PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION IS THIS IS THERE ANY KNOWLEDGE IN THE WORLD WHICH IS SO CERTAIN THAT NO REASONABLE MAN COULD DOUBT IT. OTHER QUESTIONS ASKED BY PHILOSOPHERS ARE THESE 
THE WORD PHILOSOPHY COMES FROM TWO GREEK WORDS MEANING LOVE OF WISDOM. PHILOS ADJ. BELOVED SOPHIA FEM. NOUN WISDOM.
THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PHILOSOPHY FROM DIFFERENT TIMES AND PLACES. SOME PHILOSOPHERS CAME FROM ANCIENT GREECE SUCH AS PLATO AND ARISTOTLE. OTHERS CAME FROM ASIA SUCH AS CONFUCIUS OR BUDDHA. SOME PHILOSOPHERS ARE FROM THE MIDDLE AGES IN EUROPE SUCH AS WILLIAM OF OCKHAM OR SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS. 
PHILOSOPHERS FROM THE 1600S 1700S AND 1800S INCLUDED THOMAS HOBBES REN DESCARTES JOHN LOCKE DAVID HUME AND IMMANUEL KANT. PHILOSOPHERS FROM THE 1900S INCLUDED LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN AND JEAN PAUL SARTRE.
PHILOSOPHY IS THE STUDY OF HUMANS AND THE WORLD BY THINKING AND ASKING QUESTIONS. IT IS A SCIENCE AND AN ART. PHILOSOPHY TRIES TO ANSWER IMPORTANT QUESTIONS BY COMING UP WITH ANSWERS ABOUT REAL THINGS AND ASKING WHY 
SOMETIMES PHILOSOPHY TRIES TO ANSWER THE SAME QUESTIONS AS RELIGION AND SCIENCE. PHILOSOPHERS DO NOT ALL GIVE THE SAME ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. SOME PEOPLE THINK THERE ARE NO RIGHT ANSWERS IN PHILOSOPHY ONLY BETTER ANSWERS AND WORSE ANSWERS. MANY TYPES OF PHILOSOPHY CRITICIZE OR EVEN ATTACK THE BELIEFS OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION. 
IN HIS WORK CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON IMMANUEL KANT ASKED THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS 
THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS GIVES THE DIFFERENT DOMAINS OR CATEGORIES OF PHILOSOPHY.
PHILOSOPHY CAN BE DIVIDED INTO DIFFERENT GROUPS BASED ON THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT IT ASKS. BELOW IS A LIST OF QUESTIONS SPLIT INTO GROUPS. ONE POSSIBLE LIST OF ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS CAN BE CALLED A PHILOSOPHY. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHIES BECAUSE ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS HAVE MANY DIFFERENT ANSWERS ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE. NOT ALL PHILOSOPHIES ASK THE SAME QUESTIONS. THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE USUALLY ASKED BY PHILOSOPHERS FROM THE WESTERN WORLD 
METAPHYSICS 
METAPHYSICS IS SOMETIMES SPLIT UP INTO ONTOLOGY THE PHILOSOPHY OF REAL LIFE AND LIVING THINGS THE PHILOSOPHY OF MIND AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION BUT THESE SUB BRANCHES ARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER.
ONTOLOGY 
THE PHILOSOPHY OF MIND 
THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 
IN EPISTEMOLOGY 
IN ETHICS 
IN AESTHETICS 
IN LOGIC 
IN AXIOLOGY 
OTHER DIVISIONS INCLUDE ESCHATOLOGY TELEOLOGY AND THEOLOGY. IN PAST CENTURIES NATURAL SCIENCE WAS INCLUDED IN PHILOSOPHY AND CALLED NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.
DOES PHILOSOPHY DO ANY GOOD VERY FEW PEOPLE WOULD DISPUTE THIS. IT IS EASY TO ARGUE THAT PHILOSOPHY IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE IT HELPS PEOPLE TO THINK MORE CLEARLY. PHILOSOPHY HELPS PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD AND THE WAY PEOPLE ACT AND THINK. PHILOSOPHERS BELIEVE THAT ASKING PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS IS USEFUL BECAUSE IT BRINGS WISDOM AND HELPS PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT THE WORLD AND EACH OTHER. SOME PHILOSOPHERS MIGHT EVEN ARGUE THAT THE QUESTION IS PHILOSOPHY GOOD OR BAD IS A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION ITSELF.
HOWEVER SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT PHILOSOPHY IS HARMFUL AS PHILOSOPHY ENCOURAGES FREE THINKING AND OFTEN QUESTIONS THE BELIEFS THAT OTHERS HOLD. FOR EXAMPLE PHILOSOPHIES SUCH AS SOME EXISTENTIALIST VIEWS SAY THAT THERE IS NO MEANING TO LIFE OR HUMAN EXISTENCE EXCEPT THE MEANING THAT WE MAKE UP OR INVENT. PEOPLE FROM SOME RELIGIONS DO NOT AGREE WITH THE BELIEFS OF EXISTENTIALISM.
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT EVERY MAJOR SCIENCE INCLUDING PHYSICS BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY ARE ALL DISCIPLINES THAT ORIGINALLY WERE CONSIDERED PHILOSOPHY. AS SPECULATION AND ANALYSIS ABOUT NATURE BECAME MORE DEVELOPED THESE SUBJECTS BRANCHED AWAY. THIS IS A PROCESS THAT CONTINUES EVEN TODAY PSYCHOLOGY ONLY SPLIT IN THE PAST CENTURY. IN OUR OWN TIME SUBJECTS SUCH AS CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES DECISION THEORY AND APPLIED ETHICS HAVE INCREASINGLY FOUND INDEPENDENCE FROM PHILOSOPHY AS A WHOLE. BECAUSE OF THIS PHILOSOPHY SEEMS USEFUL BECAUSE IT MAKES NEW KINDS OF SCIENCE.
PHILOSOPHERS ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT IDEAS CONCEPTS. THEY TRY TO FIND ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS. SOME THINKERS FIND IT VERY HARD TO FIND THOSE WORDS THAT BEST DESCRIBE THE IDEAS THEY HAVE. WHEN THEY FIND ANSWERS TO SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS PHILOSOPHERS OFTEN HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM THAT IS HOW TO BEST TELL THE ANSWERS THEY FOUND TO OTHER PEOPLE. DEPENDING ON THE MEANING OF THE WORDS THEY USE THE ANSWERS CHANGE. 
SOME PHILOSOPHERS ARE FULL TIME THINKERS CALLED ACADEMICS WHO WORK FOR UNIVERSITIES OR COLLEGES. THESE PHILOSOPHERS WRITE BOOKS AND ARTICLES ABOUT PHILOSOPHY AND TEACH CLASSES ABOUT PHILOSOPHY TO UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE STUDENTS.
OTHER PHILOSOPHERS ARE JUST HOBBY THINKERS WHO THINK ABOUT PHILOSOPHY DURING THEIR FREE TIME. A SMALL NUMBER OF HOBBY THINKERS HAVE THOUGHT SO MUCH ABOUT PHILOSOPHY THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO WRITE ARTICLES FOR PHILOSOPHY MAGAZINES. OTHER PEOPLE APPROACH PHILOSOPHY FROM ANOTHER JOB. FOR EXAMPLE MONKS ARTISTS AND SCIENTISTS MAY THINK ABOUT PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AND QUESTIONS.
MOST PHILOSOPHERS WORK BY ASKING QUESTIONS AND LOOKING FOR GOOD DEFINITIONS MEANINGS OF WORDS TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT A QUESTION MEANS.
SOME PHILOSOPHERS SAY THE ONLY THING NEEDED TO ANSWER A QUESTION IS TO FIND OUT WHAT IT MEANS. THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS SUCH AS THOSE ABOVE DIFFICULT IS THAT PEOPLE DO NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN HELD THIS VIEW.
PHILOSOPHERS OFTEN USE BOTH REAL AND IMAGINARY EXAMPLES TO MAKE A POINT. FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAY WRITE ABOUT A REAL OR FICTIONAL PERSON IN ORDER TO SHOW WHAT THEY THINK A GOOD PERSON OR A BAD PERSON IS LIKE.
SOME PHILOSOPHERS LOOK FOR THE SIMPLEST WAY TO ANSWER A QUESTION AND SAY THAT IS PROBABLY THE RIGHT ANSWER. THIS IS A PROCESS CALLED OCCAM S RAZOR. OTHERS BELIEVE THAT COMPLICATED ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS CAN ALSO BE RIGHT. FOR AN EXAMPLE OF A PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM SEE THE GOD PARADOX.
PHILOSOPHERS USE LOGIC TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND ANSWER QUESTIONS. LOGICAL CONSISTENCY IS A CORNERSTONE OF ANY ACCEPTABLE THEORY. PHILOSOPHERS WHO DISAGREE WITH A THEORY WILL OFTEN TRY TO FIND A LOGICAL CONTRADICTION IN A THEORY. IF THEY FIND A CONTRADICTION THIS GIVES THEM A REASON TO REJECT THAT THEORY. IF THEY DO NOT FIND AN INCONSISTENCY THE PHILOSOPHER MIGHT SHOW THAT THE THEORY LEADS TO A CONCLUSION WHICH IS EITHER UNACCEPTABLE OR RIDICULOUS. THIS SECOND APPROACH IS USUALLY CALLED REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM.
PEOPLE LISTED HERE SHOULD BE GENUINE PHILOSOPHERS RATHER THAN SOCIAL OR POLITICAL CAMPAIGNERS. THE LISTS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE COMPETE.
PHOTOSYNTHESIS
PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH PLANTS AND OTHER THINGS MAKE FOOD. IT IS A CHEMICAL PROCESS THAT USES SUNLIGHT TO TURN CARBON DIOXIDE INTO SUGARS THAT THE CELL CAN USE AS ENERGY. AS WELL AS PLANTS MANY KINDS OF ALGAE PROTISTS AND BACTERIA USE IT TO GET FOOD. PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR LIFE ON EARTH. MOST PLANTS EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY DEPEND ON IT. THE EXCEPTION ARE CERTAIN ORGANISMS THAT DIRECTLY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM CHEMICAL REACTIONS THESE ORGANISMS ARE CALLED CHEMOAUTOTROPHS.
PHOTOSYNTHESIS CAN HAPPEN IN DIFFERENT WAYS BUT THERE ARE SOME PARTS THAT ARE COMMON.
PHOTOSYNTHESIS HAS TWO MAIN SETS OF REACTIONS. LIGHT DEPENDENT REACTIONS NEED LIGHT TO WORK AND LIGHT INDEPENDENT REACTIONS WHICH DO NOT NEED LIGHT TO WORK.
LIGHT ENERGY FROM THE SUN IS USED TO SPLIT WATER MOLECULES PHOTOLYSIS. THE SUNLIGHT HITS CHLOROPLASTS IN THE PLANT CAUSING AN ENZYME TO BREAK APART THE WATER. WATER WHEN BROKEN MAKES OXYGEN HYDROGEN AND ELECTRONS IN THE PATHWAY OF DOLAI S S STATE DIAGRAMS.
REF. DOLAI U 2017 CHEMICAL SCHEME OF WATER SPLITTING PROCESS DURING PHOTOSYNTHESIS BY THE WAY OF EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS. IOSR JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES. 12 6 65 67. DOI 10.9790 3008 1206026567. ISSN 2319 7676. 
HYDROGEN ALONG WITH ELECTRONS ENERGIZED BY LIGHT CONVERTS NADP INTO NADPH WHICH IS THEN USED IN THE LIGHT INDEPENDENT REACTIONS. OXYGEN DIFFUSES OUT OF THE PLANT AS A WASTE PRODUCT OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND ATP IS SYNTHESIZED FROM ADP AND INORGANIC PHOSPHATE. THIS ALL HAPPENS IN THE GRANA OF CHLOROPLASTS.
DURING THIS REACTION SUGARS ARE BUILT UP USING CARBON DIOXIDE AND THE PRODUCTS OF THE LIGHT DEPENDENT REACTIONS ATP AND NADPH AND VARIOUS OTHER CHEMICALS FOUND IN THE PLANT IN THE CALVIN CYCLE. THEREFORE THE LIGHT INDEPENDENT REACTION CANNOT HAPPEN WITHOUT THE LIGHT DEPENDENT REACTION. CARBON DIOXIDE DIFFUSES INTO THE PLANT AND ALONG WITH CHEMICALS IN THE CHLOROPLAST ATP AND NADPH GLUCOSE IS MADE AND FINALLY TRANSPORTED AROUND THE PLANT BY TRANSLOCATION.
THERE ARE THREE MAIN FACTORS AFFECTING PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
IF THERE IS LITTLE LIGHT SHINING ON A PLANT THE LIGHT DEPENDENT REACTIONS WILL NOT WORK EFFICIENTLY. THIS MEANS THAT PHOTOLYSIS WILL NOT HAPPEN QUICKLY AND THEREFORE LITTLE NADPH AND ATP WILL BE MADE. THIS SHORTAGE OF NADPH AND ATP WILL LEAD TO THE LIGHT INDEPENDENT REACTIONS NOT WORKING AS NADPH AND ATP ARE NEEDED FOR THE LIGHT INDEPENDENT REACTIONS TO WORK.
CARBON DIOXIDE IS USED IN THE LIGHT INDEPENDENT REACTIONS. IT COMBINES WITH NADPH AND ATP AND VARIOUS OTHER CHEMICALS SUCH AS RIBULOSE BISPHOSPHATE TO FORM GLUCOSE. THEREFORE IF THERE IS NOT ENOUGH CARBON DIOXIDE THEN THERE WILL BE A BUILDUP OF NADPH AND ATP AND NOT ENOUGH GLUCOSE WILL BE FORMED.
THERE ARE MANY ENZYMES WORKING IN PHOTOSYNTHETIC REACTIONS SUCH AS THE ENZYME IN PHOTOLYSIS. THESE ENZYMES WILL NOT WORK AS WELL OR STOP WORKING AT ALL AT HIGH OR LOW TEMPERATURES AND THEREFORE SO WILL THE LIGHT DEPENDENT AND LIGHT INDEPENDENT REACTIONS. TROPICAL PLANTS HAVE A HIGHER TEMPERATURE OPTIMUM THAN THE PLANTS ADAPTED TO TEMPERATE CLIMATES.
THE FIRST PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS PROBABLY EVOLVED EARLY IN THE HISTORY OF LIFE. THEY MAY HAVE USED REDUCING AGENTS SUCH AS HYDROGEN OR HYDROGEN SULFIDE AS SOURCES OF ELECTRONS RATHER THAN WATER. CYANOBACTERIA APPEARED LATER AND THE EXCESS OXYGEN THEY PRODUCED CONTRIBUTED TO THE OXYGEN CATASTROPHE. THIS MADE THE EVOLUTION OF COMPLEX LIFE POSSIBLE. 
TODAY THE AVERAGE RATE OF ENERGY CAPTURE BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS GLOBALLY IS APPROXIMATELY 130 TERAWATTS WHICH IS ABOUT SIX TIMES LARGER THAN THE CURRENT POWER USED BY HUMAN CIVILIZATION.
PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS ALSO CONVERT AROUND 100 115 THOUSAND MILLION METRIC TONNES OF CARBON INTO BIOMASS PER YEAR.

PHYSICS
PHYSICS IS A BRANCH OF SCIENCE. IT STUDIES MATTER AND ALL FORCES AND THEIR EFFECTS. MODERN PHYSICS CONNECTS IDEAS ABOUT THE FOUR LAWS OF SYMMETRY AND CONSERVATION OF ENERGY MOMENTUM CHARGE AND PARITY. THE WORD PHYSICS COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD MEANING NATURE. PHYSICS CAN ALSO BE DEFINED AS THAT DEPARTMENT OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH RELATES TO THE ORDER OF NATURE OR IN OTHER WORDS TO THE REGULAR SUCCESSION OF EVENTS.
ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES THE MAIN GOAL OF PHYSICS IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE UNIVERSE BEHAVES.
PHYSICS IS A VERY OLD DISCIPLINE BECAUSE ASTRONOMY A PART OF PHYSICS IS THE OLDEST NATURAL SCIENCE. IN THE PAST IT WAS A PART OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY WITH OTHER FIELDS OF SCIENCE SUCH AS CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY BUT DURING THE SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION THESE FIELDS BECAME SEPARATE AND PHYSICS BECAME A DISTINCT FIELD OF KNOWLEDGE.
PHYSICS IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS AIRPLANES TELEVISIONS COMPUTERS AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS. MECHANICS A BRANCH OF PHYSICS HELPED DEVELOP THE MATHEMATICAL FIELD OF CALCULUS.
ASTRONOMY IS THE OLDEST NATURAL SCIENCE. THE SUMERIANS ANCIENT EGYPTIANS AND INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION ALL UNDERSTOOD THAT THE OBJECTS IN THE SKY MOVED SINCE BEFORE 3000 BC. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY WORSHIPED THE OBJECTS IN THE SKY AS GODS. THEIR UNDERSTANDING WASN T SCIENTIFIC BUT THEIR OBSERVATIONS INFLUENCED LATER ASTRONOMY. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ASTRONOMY CAME FROM MESOPOTAMIA BABYLONIA ANCIENT EGYPT AND ANCIENT GREECE. ASTRONOMERS FROM EGYPT BUILT MONUMENTS THAT SHOWED HOW OBJECTS IN THE SKY MOVED AND MOST OF THE NAMES FOR THE CONSTELLATIONS IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE CAME FROM GREEK ASTRONOMERS.
NATURAL PHILOSOPHY STARTED IN GREECE AROUND 650 BC WHEN A MOVEMENT OF PHILOSOPHERS REPLACED SUPERSTITION WITH NATURALISM WHICH REFUTED THE SPIRITUAL. LEUCIPPUS AND HIS STUDENT DEMOCRITUS SUGGESTED THE IDEA OF THE ATOM AROUND THIS PERIOD.
ISLAMIC SCHOLARS CONTINUED TO STUDY ARISTOTELIAN PHYSICS DURING THE ISLAMIC GOLDEN AGE. THEY ALSO DEVELOPED AN EARLY FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. SCIENTISTS LIKE IBN SAHL AL KINDI IBN AL HAYTHAM AL FARISI AND AVICENNA WORKED EXTENSIVELY ON OPTICS AND VISION. IN THE BOOK OF OPTICS IBN AL HAYTHAM REJECTED PREVIOUS GREEK IDEAS CONCERNING VISION AND PROPOSED A NEW THEORY. HE STUDIED HOW LIGHT ENTERS THE EYE AND THEN DEVELOPED THE CAMERA OBSCURA. EUROPEAN SCIENTISTS LATER BUILT EYEGLASSES MAGNIFYING GLASSES TELESCOPES AND CAMERAS FROM THIS BOOK.
PHYSICS BECAME A SEPARATE FIELD OF STUDY AFTER THE SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION. GALILEO S EXPERIMENTS HELPED TO CREATE CLASSICAL PHYSICS. ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT INVENT THE TELESCOPE HE USED IT WHEN HE LOOKED INTO THE NIGHT SKY. HE DISCOVERED THAT THE STARS AND PLANETS WERE NOT PERFECT. HE ALSO INVESTIGATED GRAVITY. ISAAC NEWTON USED GALILEO S IDEAS TO CREATE HIS THREE LAWS OF MOTION. HE ALSO DEVELOPED CALCULUS TO HELP UNDERSTAND PROBLEMS IN MECHANICS SUCH AS HOW CELESTIAL BODIES MOVED AROUND THE SUN.
IN A COUPLE CENTURIES THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WAS IN FULL SWING AND MANY MORE DISCOVERIES WERE MADE IN MANY FIELDS OF SCIENCE. THE LAWS OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO STUDY OBJECTS THAT MOVE MUCH SLOWER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND ARE NOT MICROSCOPIC. WHEN SCIENTISTS FIRST STUDIED QUANTUM MECHANICS THEY HAD TO CREATE A NEW SET OF LAWS WHICH WAS THE START OF MODERN PHYSICS.
AS SCIENTISTS RESEARCHED PARTICLES THEY DISCOVERED WHAT CLASSICAL MECHANICS COULD NOT EXPLAIN. CLASSICAL MECHANICS PREDICTED THAT THE SPEED OF LIGHT VARIED BUT EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THE SPEED OF LIGHT STAYED THE SAME. THIS WAS PREDICTED BY ALBERT EINSTEIN S THEORY OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY. EINSTEIN PREDICTED THAT THE SPEED OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION THROUGH EMPTY SPACE WOULD ALWAYS BE THE SAME. HIS VIEW OF SPACE TIME REPLACED THE ANCIENT IDEA THAT SPACE AND TIME WERE QUITE SEPARATE THINGS.
MAX PLANCK CAME UP WITH QUANTUM MECHANICS TO EXPLAIN WHY METAL RELEASES ELECTRONS WHEN YOU SHINE A LIGHT AT IT AND WHY MATTER EMITS RADIATION. QUANTUM MECHANICS APPLIES FOR VERY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE ELECTRONS PROTONS AND NEUTRONS THAT MAKE UP AN ATOM. PEOPLE LIKE WERNER HEISENBERG ERWIN SCHR DINGER AND PAUL DIRAC CONTINUED TO WORK ON QUANTUM MECHANICS AND EVENTUALLY WE GOT THE STANDARD MODEL.
PHYSICS IS THE STUDY OF ENERGY AND MATTER IN SPACE AND TIME AND HOW THEY ARE RELATED TO EACH OTHER. PHYSICISTS ASSUME THE EXISTENCE OF MASS LENGTH TIME AND ELECTRIC CURRENT AND THEN DEFINE GIVE THE MEANING OF ALL OTHER PHYSICAL QUANTITIES IN TERMS OF THESE BASIC UNITS. MASS LENGTH TIME AND ELECTRIC CURRENT ARE NEVER DEFINED BUT THE STANDARD UNITS USED TO MEASURE THEM ARE ALWAYS DEFINED. IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS ABBREVIATED SI FROM THE FRENCH SYST ME INTERNATIONAL THE KILOGRAM IS THE BASIC UNIT OF MASS THE METRE IS THE BASIC UNIT OF LENGTH THE SECOND IS THE BASIC UNIT OF TIME AND THE AMPERE IS THE BASIC UNIT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT.
IN ADDITION TO THESE FOUR UNITS THERE ARE THREE OTHER ONES THE MOLE WHICH IS THE UNIT OF THE QUANTITY OF MATTER THE CANDELA WHICH MEASURES THE LUMINOUS INTENSITY THE POWER OF LIGHTING AND THE KELVIN THE UNIT OF TEMPERATURE.
PHYSICS STUDIES HOW THINGS MOVE AND THE FORCES THAT MAKE THEM MOVE. FOR EXAMPLE VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION ARE USED BY PHYSICS TO SHOW HOW THINGS MOVE. ALSO PHYSICISTS STUDY THE FORCES OF GRAVITY ELECTRICITY MAGNETISM AND THE FORCES THAT HOLD THINGS TOGETHER. 
PHYSICS STUDIES VERY LARGE THINGS AND VERY SMALL THINGS. FOR INSTANCE PHYSICISTS CAN STUDY STARS PLANETS AND GALAXIES BUT COULD ALSO STUDY SMALL PIECES OF MATTER SUCH AS ATOMS AND ELECTRONS.THEY MAY ALSO STUDY SOUND LIGHT AND OTHER WAVES. AS WELL AS THAT THEY COULD EXAMINE ENERGY HEAT AND RADIOACTIVITY AND EVEN SPACE AND TIME. 
PHYSICS NOT ONLY HELPS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW OBJECTS MOVE BUT HOW THEY CHANGE FORM HOW THEY MAKE NOISE HOW HOT OR COLD THEY WILL BE AND WHAT THEY ARE MADE OF AT THE SMALLEST LEVEL.
PHYSICS IS A QUANTITATIVE SCIENCE BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON MEASURING WITH NUMBERS. MATHEMATICS IS USED IN PHYSICS TO MAKE MODELS THAT TRY TO GUESS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN NATURE. THE GUESSES ARE COMPARED TO THE WAY THE REAL WORLD WORKS. THESE GUESSES ARE MADE BY THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS AND THEY ARE COMPARED TO THE REAL WORLD BY EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICISTS. PHYSICISTS ARE ALWAYS WORKING TO MAKE THEIR MODELS OF THE WORLD BETTER.
PHYSICS IS THE SCIENCE OF MATTER AND HOW MATTER INTERACTS. MATTER IS ANY PHYSICAL MATERIAL IN THE UNIVERSE. EVERYTHING IS MADE OF MATTER. PHYSICS IS USED TO DESCRIBE THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE AROUND US AND TO PREDICT HOW IT WILL BEHAVE. 
PHYSICS IS THE SCIENCE CONCERNED WITH THE DISCOVERY AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE UNIVERSAL LAWS WHICH GOVERN MATTER MOVEMENT AND FORCES AND SPACE AND TIME AND OTHER FEATURES OF THE NATURAL WORLD.
THE SWEEP OF PHYSICS IS BROAD FROM THE SMALLEST COMPONENTS OF MATTER AND THE FORCES THAT HOLD IT TOGETHER TO GALAXIES AND EVEN LARGER THINGS. THERE ARE ONLY FOUR FORCES THAT APPEAR TO OPERATE OVER THIS WHOLE RANGE. HOWEVER EVEN THESE FOUR FORCES GRAVITY ELECTROMAGNETISM THE WEAK FORCE ASSOCIATED WITH RADIOACTIVITY AND THE STRONG FORCE WHICH HOLDS PROTONS AND NEUTRONS IN AN ATOM TOGETHER ARE BELIEVED TO BE DIFFERENT PARTS OF A SINGLE FORCE. 
PHYSICS IS MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE GOAL OF MAKING EVER SIMPLER MORE GENERAL AND MORE ACCURATE RULES THAT DEFINE THE CHARACTER AND BEHAVIOR OF MATTER AND SPACE ITSELF. 
ONE OF THE MAJOR GOALS OF PHYSICS IS MAKING THEORIES THAT APPLY TO EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE. IN OTHER WORDS PHYSICS CAN BE VIEWED AS THE STUDY OF THOSE UNIVERSAL LAWS WHICH DEFINE AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL POSSIBLE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE.
PHYSICS USES THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. THAT IS DATA FROM EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS ARE COLLECTED. THEORIES WHICH ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THESE DATA ARE PRODUCED. PHYSICS USES THESE THEORIES TO NOT ONLY DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA BUT TO MODEL PHYSICAL SYSTEMS AND PREDICT HOW THESE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS WILL BEHAVE. PHYSICISTS THEN COMPARE THESE PREDICTIONS TO OBSERVATIONS OR EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE TO SHOW WHETHER THE THEORY IS RIGHT OR WRONG.
THE THEORIES THAT ARE WELL SUPPORTED BY DATA AND ARE ESPECIALLY SIMPLE AND GENERAL ARE SOMETIMES CALLED SCIENTIFIC LAWS. OF COURSE ALL THEORIES INCLUDING THOSE KNOWN AS LAWS CAN BE REPLACED BY MORE ACCURATE AND MORE GENERAL LAWS WHEN A DISAGREEMENT WITH DATA IS FOUND.
PHYSICS IS MORE QUANTITATIVE THAN MOST OTHER SCIENCES. THAT IS MANY OF THE OBSERVATIONS IN PHYSICS MAY BE REPRESENTED IN THE FORM OF NUMERICAL MEASUREMENTS. MOST OF THE THEORIES IN PHYSICS USE MATHEMATICS TO EXPRESS THEIR PRINCIPLES. MOST OF THE PREDICTIONS FROM THESE THEORIES ARE NUMERICAL. THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE AREAS WHICH PHYSICS HAS ADDRESSED WORK BETTER WITH QUANTITATIVE APPROACHES THAN OTHER AREAS. SCIENCES ALSO TEND TO BECOME MORE QUANTITATIVE WITH TIME AS THEY BECOME MORE HIGHLY DEVELOPED AND PHYSICS IS ONE OF THE OLDEST SCIENCES.
CLASSICAL PHYSICS NORMALLY INCLUDES THE FIELDS OF MECHANICS OPTICS ELECTRICITY MAGNETISM ACOUSTICS AND THERMODYNAMICS. MODERN PHYSICS IS A TERM NORMALLY USED TO COVER FIELDS WHICH RELY ON QUANTUM THEORY INCLUDING QUANTUM MECHANICS ATOMIC PHYSICS NUCLEAR PHYSICS PARTICLE PHYSICS AND CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS AS WELL AS THE MORE MODERN FIELDS OF GENERAL AND SPECIAL RELATIVITY BUT THESE LAST TWO ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED FIELDS OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS AS THEY DO NOT RELY ON QUANTUM THEORY. ALTHOUGH THIS DIFFERENCE CAN BE FOUND IN OLDER WRITINGS IT IS OF LITTLE NEW INTEREST AS QUANTUM EFFECTS ARE NOW UNDERSTOOD TO BE OF IMPORTANCE EVEN IN FIELDS THAT BEFORE WERE CALLED CLASSICAL.
THERE ARE MANY APPROACHES TO STUDYING PHYSICS AND MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES IN PHYSICS. THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES OF ACTIVITIES IN PHYSICS THE COLLECTION OF DATA AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEORIES. 
THE DATA IN SOME SUBFIELDS OF PHYSICS IS AMENABLE TO EXPERIMENT. FOR EXAMPLE CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS BENEFIT FROM THE ABILITY TO PERFORM EXPERIMENTS. EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS FOCUSES MAINLY ON AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH. SOMETIMES EXPERIMENTS ARE DONE TO EXPLORE NATURE AND IN OTHER CASES EXPERIMENTS ARE PERFORMED TO PRODUCE DATA TO COMPARE WITH THE PREDICTIONS OF THEORIES. 
SOME OTHER FIELDS IN PHYSICS LIKE ASTROPHYSICS AND GEOPHYSICS ARE MOSTLY OBSERVATIONAL SCIENCES BECAUSE MOST OF THEIR DATA HAS TO BE COLLECTED PASSIVELY INSTEAD OF THROUGH EXPERIMENTATION. HOWEVER OBSERVATIONAL PROGRAMS IN THESE FIELDS USE MANY OF THE SAME TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT ARE USED IN THE EXPERIMENTAL SUBFIELDS OF PHYSICS. 
THEORETICAL PHYSICS OFTEN USES QUANTITATIVE APPROACHES TO DEVELOP THE THEORIES THAT ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THE DATA. IN THIS WAY THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS OFTEN USE TOOLS FROM MATHEMATICS. THEORETICAL PHYSICS OFTEN CAN INVOLVE CREATING QUANTITATIVE PREDICTIONS OF PHYSICAL THEORIES AND COMPARING THESE PREDICTIONS QUANTITATIVELY WITH DATA. THEORETICAL PHYSICS SOMETIMES CREATES MODELS OF PHYSICAL SYSTEMS BEFORE DATA IS AVAILABLE TO TEST AND SUPPORT THESE MODELS.
THESE TWO MAIN ACTIVITIES IN PHYSICS DATA COLLECTION THEORY PRODUCTION AND TESTING USE MANY DIFFERENT SKILLS. THIS HAS LED TO A LOT OF SPECIALIZATION IN PHYSICS AND THE INTRODUCTION DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF TOOLS FROM OTHER FIELDS. FOR EXAMPLE THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS USE MATHEMATICS AND NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND STATISTICS AND PROBABILITY AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE IN THEIR WORK. EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICISTS DEVELOP INSTRUMENTS AND TECHNIQUES FOR COLLECTING DATA USING ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND MANY OTHER FIELDS OF TECHNOLOGY. OFTEN THE TOOLS FROM THESE OTHER AREAS ARE NOT QUITE APPROPRIATE FOR THE NEEDS OF PHYSICS AND NEED TO BE CHANGED OR MORE ADVANCED VERSIONS HAVE TO BE MADE.
IT IS FREQUENT FOR NEW PHYSICS TO BE DISCOVERED IF EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICISTS DO AN EXPERIMENT THAT CURRENT THEORIES CANNOT EXPLAIN OR FOR THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS TO GENERATE THEORIES WHICH CAN THEN BE PUT TO THE TEST BY EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICISTS.
EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY ARE RELATED. EXPERIMENTS OFTEN NEED SPECIALIZED TOOLS SUCH AS PARTICLE ACCELERATORS LASERS AND IMPORTANT INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS SUCH AS TRANSISTORS AND MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING HAVE COME FROM APPLIED RESEARCH.
FAMOUS THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS INCLUDE
PLANT
PLANTS ARE ONE OF FIVE BIG GROUPS KINGDOMS OF LIVING THINGS. THEY ARE AUTOTROPHIC EUKARYOTES WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE COMPLEX CELLS AND MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD. USUALLY THEY CANNOT MOVE NOT COUNTING GROWTH.
PLANTS INCLUDE FAMILIAR TYPES SUCH AS TREES HERBS BUSHES GRASSES VINES FERNS MOSSES AND GREEN ALGAE. THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF PLANTS KNOWN AS BOTANY HAS IDENTIFIED ABOUT 350 000 EXTANT LIVING SPECIES OF PLANTS. FUNGI AND NON GREEN ALGAE ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS PLANTS.
MOST PLANTS GROW IN THE GROUND WITH STEMS ABOVE THE ATMOSPHERE AND ROOTS BELOW. SOME FLOAT ON WATER. WATER AND SOME NUTRIENTS COME FROM THE ROOTS. THEN CLIMB THE STEM AND REACH THE LEAVES. THE EVAPORATION OF WATER FROM PORES IN THE LEAVES PULLS WATER THROUGH THE PLANT. THIS IS CALLED TRANSPIRATION.
A PLANT NEEDS SUNLIGHT CARBON DIOXIDE MINERALS AND WATER TO MAKE FOOD BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS. A GREEN SUBSTANCE IN PLANTS CALLED CHLOROPHYLL TRAPS THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN NEEDED TO MAKE FOOD. CHLOROPHYLL IS MOSTLY FOUND IN LEAVES INSIDE PLASTIDS WHICH ARE INSIDE THE LEAF CELLS. THE LEAF CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS A FOOD FACTORY. LEAVES OF PLANTS VARY IN SHAPE AND SIZE BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS THE PLANT ORGAN BEST SUITED TO CAPTURE SOLAR ENERGY. ONCE THE FOOD IS MADE IN THE LEAF IT IS TRANSPORTED TO THE OTHER PARTS OF THE PLANT SUCH AS STEMS AND ROOTS.
THE WORD PLANT CAN ALSO MEAN TO PUT SOMETHING IN THE EARTH. FOR EXAMPLE FARMERS PLANT SEEDS IN THE GROUND.
PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS A PROCESS THAT IS TAKEN PLACE BY THE LEAVES ON THE PLANT. THE LEAVES ARE THE ONLY PARTS OF A PLANT THAT CAN DO THIS PROCESS AS THEY ADAPTED. THIS IS ALSO KNOWN AS HOW THE PLANT GETS ITS FOOD.
GREEN ALGAE 
LAND PLANTS EMBRYOPHYTES 
AT LEAST SOME PLANT CELLS CONTAIN PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANELLES PLASTIDS WHICH ENABLE THEM TO MAKE FOOD FOR THEMSELVES. WITH SUNLIGHT WATER AND CARBON DIOXIDE THE PLASTIDS MAKE SUGARS THE BASIC MOLECULES NEEDED BY THE PLANT. FREE OXYGEN O IS PRODUCED AS A BY PRODUCT OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS.
LATER IN THE CELL CYTOPLASM THE SUGARS MAY BE TURNED INTO AMINO ACIDS FOR PROTEINS NUCLEOTIDES FOR DNA AND RNA AND CARBOHYDRATES SUCH AS STARCH. THIS PROCESS NEEDS CERTAIN MINERALS NITROGEN POTASSIUM PHOSPHORUS IRON AND MAGNESIUM.
PLANT NUTRITION IS THE STUDY OF THE CHEMICAL ELEMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR PLANT GROWTH.
MACRONUTRIENTS 
MICRONUTRIENTS TRACE ELEMENTS INCLUDE 
THE ROOTS OF PLANTS PERFORM TWO MAIN FUNCTIONS. FIRST THEY ANCHOR THE PLANT TO THE GROUND. SECOND THEY ABSORB WATER AND VARIOUS NUTRIENTS DISSOLVED IN WATER FROM THE SOIL. PLANTS USE THE WATER TO MAKE FOOD. THE WATER ALSO PROVIDES THE PLANT WITH SUPPORT. PLANTS THAT LACK WATER BECOME VERY LIMP AND THEIR STEMS CANNOT SUPPORT THEIR LEAVES. PLANTS WHICH SPECIALISE IN DESERT AREAS ARE CALLED XEROPHYTES OR PHREATOPHYTES DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF ROOT GROWTH.
WATER IS TRANSPORTED FROM THE ROOTS TO THE REST OF THE PLANT THROUGH SPECIAL VESSELS IN THE PLANT. WHEN THE WATER REACHES THE LEAVES SOME OF IT EVAPORATES INTO THE AIR. MANY PLANTS NEED THE HELP OF FUNGI TO MAKE THEIR ROOTS WORK PROPERLY. THIS PLANT FUNGI SYMBIOSIS IS CALLED MYCORRHIZA. RHIZOBIA BACTERIA IN ROOT NODULES HELP SOME PLANTS GET NITROGEN.
FLOWERS ARE THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGAN ONLY OF FLOWERING PLANTS ANGIOSPERMS. THE PETALS OF A FLOWER ARE OFTEN BRIGHTLY COLORED AND SCENTED TO ATTRACT INSECTS AND OTHER POLLINATORS. THE STAMEN IS THE MALE PART OF THE PLANT. IT IS COMPOSED OF THE FILAMENT A STALK THAT HOLDS THE ANTHER WHICH PRODUCES THE POLLEN. POLLEN IS NEEDED FOR PLANTS TO PRODUCE SEEDS. THE CARPEL IS THE FEMALE PART OF THE FLOWER. THE TOP PART OF THE CARPEL CONTAINS THE STIGMA. THE STYLE IS THE NECK OF THE CARPEL. THE OVARY IS THE SWOLLEN AREA AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CARPEL. THE OVARY PRODUCES THE SEEDS. THE SEPAL IS A LEAF THAT PROTECTS A FLOWER AS A BUD.
THE PROCESS BY WHICH POLLEN GETS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE FLOWER TO ANOTHER FLOWER IS CALLED POLLINATION. THIS TRANSFER CAN HAPPEN IN DIFFERENT WAYS. INSECTS SUCH AS BEES ARE ATTRACTED TO BRIGHT SCENTED FLOWERS. WHEN BEES GO INTO THE FLOWER TO GATHER NECTAR THE SPIKY POLLEN STICKS TO THEIR BACK LEGS. THE STICKY STIGMA ON ANOTHER FLOWER CATCHES THE POLLEN WHEN THE BEE LANDS OR FLIES NEARBY IT.
SOME FLOWERS USE THE WIND TO CARRY POLLEN. THEIR DANGLING STAMENS PRODUCE LOTS OF POLLEN THAT IS LIGHT ENOUGH TO BE CARRIED BY THE WIND. THEIR FLOWERS ARE USUALLY SMALL AND NOT HIGHLY COLOURED. THE STIGMAS OF THESE FLOWERS ARE FEATHERY AND HANG OUTSIDE THE FLOWER TO CATCH THE POLLEN AS IT FALLS.
A PLANT PRODUCES MANY SPORES OR SEEDS. LOWER PLANTS SUCH AS MOSS AND FERNS PRODUCE SPORES. THE SEED PLANTS ARE THE GYMNOSPERMS AND ANGIOSPERMS. IF ALL THE SEEDS FELL TO THE GROUND BESIDES THE PLANT THE AREA MIGHT BECOME OVERCROWDED. THERE MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH WATER AND MINERALS FOR ALL THE SEEDS. SEEDS USUALLY HAVE SOME WAY TO GET TO NEW PLACES. SOME SEEDS CAN BE DISPERSED BY THE WIND OR BY WATER. SEEDS INSIDE JUICY FRUITS ARE DISPERSED AFTER BEING EATEN. SOMETIMES SEEDS STICK TO ANIMALS AND ARE DISPERSED THAT WAY.
THE QUESTION OF THE EARLIEST PLANT FOSSILS DEPENDS ON WHAT IS MEANT BY THE WORD PLANT.
BY THE SILURIAN FOSSILS OF WHOLE PLANTS ARE PRESERVED INCLUDING THE LYCOPHYTE BARAGWANATHIA LONGIFOLIA. FROM THE DEVONIAN DETAILED FOSSILS OF RHYNIOPHYTES HAVE BEEN FOUND. EARLY FOSSILS OF THESE ANCIENT PLANTS SHOW THE INDIVIDUAL CELLS WITHIN THE PLANT TISSUE. THE DEVONIAN PERIOD ALSO SAW THE EVOLUTION OF THE FIRST TREE IN THE FOSSIL RECORD WATTEZIA. THIS FERN LIKE TREE HAD A TRUNK WITH FRONDS AND PRODUCED SPORES.
THE COAL MEASURES ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF PALAEOZOIC PLANT FOSSILS WITH MANY GROUPS OF PLANTS IN EXISTENCE AT THIS TIME. THE SPOIL HEAPS OF COAL MINES ARE THE BEST PLACES TO COLLECT COAL ITSELF IS THE REMAINS OF FOSSILISED PLANTS THOUGH STRUCTURAL DETAIL OF THE PLANT FOSSILS IS RARELY VISIBLE IN COAL. IN THE FOSSIL FOREST AT VICTORIA PARK IN GLASGOW THE STUMPS OF LEPIDODENDRON TREES ARE FOUND IN THEIR ORIGINAL GROWTH POSITIONS.
POLICE
POLICE ARE A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO ENFORCE LAWS HELP WITH EMERGENCIES SOLVE CRIMES AND PROTECT PROPERTY. PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE POLICE ARE CALLED POLICE OFFICERS OR POLICEMEN. THEY WORK OUT OF A POLICE STATION. POLICE ARE TRAINED IN FIRST AID AND RESCUE BECAUSE POLICE OFFICERS ARE OFTEN ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE SICK OR INJURED SUCH AS A CAR ACCIDENT OR A FIRE.
THE POLICE HAVE DIFFERENT POWERS TO HELP THEM DO THEIR JOB. THESE POWERS ARE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. MOST POLICE OFFICERS HAVE THE POWER TO ARREST PEOPLE SEARCH PEOPLE AND SEARCH HOUSES PROPERTIES. THEY SOMETIMES CARRY EQUIPMENT SUCH AS GUNS BATONS TASERS OR PEPPER SPRAY. THE AREA WHERE POLICE OFFICERS CAN USE THESE POWERS IS CALLED THEIR JURISDICTION. IF OFFICERS ARE OUTSIDE OF THEIR JURISDICTION ANOTHER POLICE FORCE WITH JURISDICTION CAN THEN USE THEIR POWERS.
THE POLICE DEAL WITH 
MOST POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE OFFICERS IN TWO MAIN GROUPS A PATROL GROUP WITH OFFICERS WHO WEAR UNIFORMS AND A DETECTIVE GROUP WITH OFFICERS WHO WEAR NORMAL CLOTHING. 
NOT ALL COUNTRIES USE THE SAME WORDS TO DESCRIBE THESE GROUPS. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM FOR EXAMPLE PATROL OFFICERS FORM THE UNIFORM BRANCH WHILE DETECTIVES WORK WITHIN THE CID CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT. 
POLICE UNIFORMS EQUIPMENT AND METHODS VARY DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY. IN SOME PLACES GROUPS OF POLICE TRAIN FOR SPECIAL JOBS SUCH AS DEALING WITH RIOTS OR DEALING WITH HIGHLY DANGEROUS CRIMINALS. 
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES FOR THEIR POLICE. IN IRELAND THEY ARE CALLED THE GARDA. IN RUSSIA THEY WERE CALLED THE MILITSIYER UNTIL 2012 NOW THEY ARE CALLED THE POLITSIYER. OTHER NAMES FOR POLICE SERVICES ARE SHERIFF S OFFICE MARSHAL S OFFICE OR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY. IN THE SAME COUNTRY THERE CAN BE DIFFERENT TYPES OF POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAVE POWERS IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND SITUATIONS SUCH AS STATE POLICE MILITARY POLICE AND LOCAL POLICE. 
WORLDWIDE POLICE ARE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY SERVE. ON AVERAGE THERE ARE 303.3 POLICE OFFICERS PER 100 000 PEOPLE. 
IN MANY COUNTRIES POLICE OFFICERS CARRY GUNS DURING THEIR NORMAL DUTIES. IN OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE THE UNITED KINGDOM NEW ZEALAND AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND MOST POLICE OFFICERS DO NOT CARRY GUNS.
OFFICERS COMMUNICATE USING RADIO DEVICES. THE RADIOS CAN BE ON BOTH THE UNIFORM AND IN THE PATROL VEHICLE. 
PSYCHOLOGY
PSYCHOLOGY IS THE STUDY OF THE MIND ITS THOUGHT FEELING AND BEHAVIOUR. IT IS AN ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE WHICH INVOLVES THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF MENTAL FACULTIES FUNCTIONS AND BEHAVIOURS.
PSYCHOLOGY DEALS MAINLY WITH HUMANS BUT ALSO SOMETIMES WITH NONHUMAN ANIMALS. BECAUSE PSYCHOLOGY MAY BE DIFFICULT TO STUDY AS A WHOLE PSYCHOLOGISTS OFTEN ONLY LOOK AT SMALL PARTS OF IT AT ONE TIME. PSYCHOLOGY HAS MUCH IN COMMON WITH MANY OTHER FIELDS AND OVERLAPS WITH MANY OF THEM. SOME OF THESE FIELDS ARE MEDICINE ETHOLOGY COMPUTER SCIENCE AND LINGUISTICS.
IN THIS FIELD A PROFESSIONAL OR RESEARCHER IS CALLED A PSYCHOLOGIST AND IS A SOCIAL BEHAVIOURAL OR COGNITIVE SCIENTIST. PSYCHOLOGISTS ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF MENTAL FUNCTIONS IN INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. THEY ALSO EXPLORE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND NEUROBIOLOGICAL PROCESSES WHICH UNDERLIE COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS AND BEHAVIOURS.
PSYCHOLOGY HAS BEEN SPLIT UP INTO SMALLER PARTS CALLED BRANCHES. THESE ARE SUBJECTS IN PSYCHOLOGY THAT TRY TO ANSWER A PARTICULAR GROUP OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW PEOPLE THINK. SOME BRANCHES OF PSYCHOLOGY THAT ARE OFTEN STUDIED ARE 
PSYCHOLOGY IS A TYPE OF SCIENCE AND RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGISTS USE MANY OF THE SAME TYPES OF METHODS THAT RESEARCHERS FROM OTHER NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES USE. 
PSYCHOLOGISTS MAKE THEORIES TO TRY TO EXPLAIN A BEHAVIOR OR PATTERN THEY SEE. BASED ON THEIR THEORY THEY MAKE SOME PREDICTIONS. THEY THEN CARRY OUT AN EXPERIMENT OR COLLECT OTHER TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT WILL TELL THEM WHETHER THEIR PREDICTIONS WERE RIGHT OR WRONG. 
SOME TYPES OF EXPERIMENTS CANNOT BE DONE ON PEOPLE BECAUSE THE PROCESS WOULD BE TOO LONG EXPENSIVE DANGEROUS UNFAIR OR OTHERWISE UNETHICAL. THERE ARE ALSO OTHER WAYS PSYCHOLOGISTS STUDY THE MIND AND BEHAVIOR SCIENTIFICALLY AND TEST THEIR THEORIES. PSYCHOLOGISTS MIGHT WAIT FOR SOME EVENTS TO HAPPEN ON THEIR OWN THEY MIGHT LOOK AT PATTERNS AMONG EXISTING GROUPS OF PEOPLE IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS OR THEY MIGHT DO EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS WHICH CAN BE SIMPLER AND MORE ETHICAL TO STUDY.
PSYCHOLOGY SHARES OTHER THINGS WITH NATURAL SCIENCES AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE A GOOD PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY MAY BE POSSIBLE TO PROVE WRONG. JUST LIKE IN ANY NATURAL SCIENCE A GROUP OF PSYCHOLOGISTS CAN NEVER BE COMPLETELY SURE THAT THEIR THEORY IS THE RIGHT ONE. IF A THEORY CAN BE PROVED WRONG BUT EXPERIMENTS DO NOT PROVE IT WRONG THEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT THE THEORY IS ACCURATE. THIS IS CALLED FALSIFIABILITY.
PSYCHOLOGISTS USE MANY TOOLS AS PART OF THEIR DAILY WORK. PSYCHOLOGISTS USE SURVEYS TO ASK PEOPLE HOW THEY FEEL AND WHAT THEY THINK. THEY MAY USE SPECIAL DEVICES TO LOOK AT THE BRAIN AND TO SEE WHAT IT IS DOING. PSYCHOLOGISTS USE COMPUTERS TO COLLECT DATA AS THEY MEASURE HOW PEOPLE BEHAVE IN RESPONSE TO PICTURES WORDS SYMBOLS OR OTHER STIMULI. PSYCHOLOGISTS ALSO USE STATISTICS TO HELP THEM ANALYZE THE DATA THAT THEY GET FROM THEIR EXPERIMENTS.
NOT ALL PSYCHOLOGY IS SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY. PSYCHODYNAMIC PSYCHOLOGY AND DEPTH PSYCHOLOGY DO THINGS LIKE INTERPRETING PEOPLE S DREAMS TO UNDERSTAND THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AS IN OLDER APPROACHES TO PSYCHOLOGY BEGUN BY CARL JUNG WHO WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN FINDING METHODS FOR MEASURING WHAT KIND OF PERSONALITY PEOPLE HAVE.
HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY AND EXISTENTIAL PSYCHOLOGY ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND PERSONAL MEANING THAN TO FIND CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF MENTAL PROCESSES AND BEHAVIOURS.
PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY. A PSYCHOLOGIST MAY WORK IN EITHER BASIC RESEARCH OR APPLIED RESEARCH. BASIC RESEARCH IS THE STUDY OF PEOPLE OR ANIMALS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM. APPLIED RESEARCH IS USING WHAT WAS LEARNED FROM BASIC RESEARCH TO SOLVE REAL WORLD PROBLEMS. IF HE OR SHE IS QUALIFIED AS A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST THEY MAY BE A THERAPIST OR COUNSELLOR AS WELL AS A RESEARCHER. 
TO BECOME A PSYCHOLOGIST A PERSON MUST FIRST GET A BASIC DEGREE AT A UNIVERSITY AND THEN GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL. A MASTER S DEGREE EITHER MSC MASTER OF SCIENCE OR MA MASTER OF ARTS ALLOWS BEGINNING WORK LIKE A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST. A DOCTORATE DEGREE TAKES A LONGER TIME BECAUSE IT INCLUDES DOING RESEARCH AND WRITING A DETAILED REPORT CALLED A DISSERTATION OR THESIS. THE DOCTORAL GRADUATE USES THE INITIALS PHD OR DPHIL DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY AFTER HIS OR HER NAME. SOME CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGISTS EARN A DOCTOR OF PSYCHOLOGY DEGREE AND USE THE INITIALS PSYD AFTER THEIR NAME. THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION SAYS THAT PEOPLE NEED A PHD OR PSYD AND A CURRENT STATE LICENSE IN THE U.S. IN ORDER TO CALL THEMSELVES A PSYCHOLOGIST.
THE WORDS PSYCHOLOGIST AND PSYCHIATRIST MAY BE CONFUSED WITH EACH OTHER. A PSYCHIATRIST HAS GRADUATED FROM MEDICAL SCHOOL AND USES THE INITIALS MD OR ITS EQUIVALENT MB CHB IN LONDON UNIVERSITY FOR EXAMPLE. A PSYCHIATRIST OR DOCTOR MAY WORK WITH A PSYCHOLOGIST THEY MAY PRESCRIBE AND CHECK ON THE EFFECT OF MEDICATIONS.
PUNCTUATION
PUNCTUATION IS THE NAME FOR MARKS USED IN WRITING. THEY ARE TO HELP UNDERSTANDING AND CORRECT READING. THESE ARE SOME COMMON PUNCTUATION MARKS USED IN ENGLISH 
THE USE OF PUNCTUATION IN ENGLISH CAN CHANGE FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND FROM TIME TO TIME. MODERN TYPOGRAPHY SUGGESTS THAT PUNCTUATION SHOULD ONLY BE USED WHEN THERE IS A NEED. THAT RESULTS IN LESS PUNCTUATION THAN WAS THE CASE THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY.
THE USE OF THESE MARKS IS OFTEN DECIDED BY A GROUP OR ORGANIZATION AND THEN WRITTEN DOWN AS A STYLE GUIDE. NEWSPAPERS HAVE A STYLE GUIDE TO MAKE THEIR CONTENT USE THE SAME RULES CONSISTENCY.
IN THE SECOND EXAMPLE NO STYLE GUIDE WILL HELP. THE WRITER JUST HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SENTENCE IS UNDERSTOOD AS IT IS WRITTEN. PUNCTUATION IS THERE TO HELP THE READER MAKE SENSE OF WHAT IS WRITTEN. OFTEN IT IS BEST TO CHANGE THE SENTENCE SO THAT THE MEANING DOES NOT REST ON A COMMA.
THAT SEEMS TO MAKE THE MEANINGS CLEAR.
A PERIOD U.S.A. FULL STOP U.K. AND COMMONWEALTH OR FULL POINT TYPOGRAPHY AND PRINTING LOOKS LIKE THIS.
A PERIOD OR STOP IS USED TO END A SENTENCE. THE PERIOD PLUS A SPACE SEPARATES SENTENCES IN PROSE AND MAKES IT EASIER TO READ. IF THEY ARE NOT NEEDED THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN A LIST FORMAT IT IS OBVIOUS WHEN A SECTION ENDS THEREFORE IT DOES NOT NEED A FULL STOP.
A PERIOD CAN SHOW NUMBERS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN ONE. WITH MONEY A PERIOD IS USED TO SHOW THE AMOUNT OF MONEY LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR.
A PERIOD IS SOMETIMES USED TO SHOW THAT A WORD HAS BEEN MADE SHORTER. A WORD THAT IS MADE SHORTER WITH A PERIOD IS CALLED AN ABBREVIATION.
A COMMA LOOKS LIKE THIS 
A COMMA HAS MANY USES. SOME OF THESE ARE SHOWN BELOW 
A QUESTION MARK LOOKS LIKE THIS 
QUESTION MARKS ARE USED WHEN WRITING A QUESTION TO MAKE AN INQUIRY OR TO ASK SOMETHING.
AN EXCLAMATION MARK LOOKS LIKE THIS 
AN EXCLAMATION MARK IS USED TO WRITE ABOUT A STRONG EMOTION OR TO WRITE THE WORDS A PERSON SHOUTED. IT CAN BE USED TO MAKE A STATEMENT STRONGER OR MORE FORCEFUL.
AN EXCLAMATION MARK CAN BE USED WITH A QUESTION MARK TO MAKE A QUESTION MORE FORCEFUL.
AN APOSTROPHE LOOKS LIKE THIS 
AN APOSTROPHE HAS TWO MAIN USES 
AN APOSTROPHE CAN BE USED TO SHOW THAT SOMETHING BELONGS TO SOMEONE ELSE.
IF THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THE LETTER S IS USED AFTER AN APOSTROPHE TO SHOW OWNERSHIP.
SOMETIMES THE LETTER S IS NOT USED AFTER AN APOSTROPHE TO SHOW OWNERSHIP. A WORD WILL END WITH JUST AN APOSTROPHE IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE THING AND THE WORD ALREADY ENDS WITH AN S.
AN APOSTROPHE CAN BE USED TO PUT TWO SMALL WORDS TOGETHER. TWO SMALL WORDS THAT ARE PUT TOGETHER WITH AN APOSTROPHE TO MAKE ONE WORD ARE CALLED CONTRACTIONS. THIS IS NORMAL IN WRITING ABOUT A PERSON SPEAKING. SPOKEN ENGLISH OFTEN USES CONTRACTIONS BECAUSE THESE WORDS ARE EASIER TO SAY.
PRONOUNS DO NOT USE AN APOSTROPHE TO SHOW THAT SOMETHING BELONGS TO SOMETHING ELSE. AMONG THESE ARE ITS HIS HERS THEIRS.
PLURALS WORDS REFERRING TO MORE THAN ONE THING DO NOT NEED AN APOSTROPHE.
QUOTATION MARKS ALSO CALLED QUOTE MARKS OR QUOTES FOR SHORT ARE USED AROUND THE WORDS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID OR DIRECT SPEECH. THEY ARE USED IN PAIRS.
WHEN QUOTATION MARKS SIT NEXT TO PERIODS AND COMMAS THERE ARE TWO STYLES OF PUNCTUATION. THESE TWO STYLES ARE MOST COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS AMERICAN AND BRITISH THE BRITISH ONE IS ALSO CALLED LOGICAL QUOTATION. 
BOTH SYSTEMS HAVE THE SAME RULES REGARDING QUESTION MARKS EXCLAMATION POINTS COLONS AND SEMICOLONS. BUT THEY DIFFER IN HOW THEY TREAT FULL STOPS AND COMMAS.
IN ALL MAJOR FORMS OF ENGLISH QUESTION MARKS EXCLAMATION MARKS SEMICOLONS AND ANY OTHER PUNCTUATION ARE PLACED INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE CLOSING QUOTATION MARK DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY ARE PART OF THE QUOTED MATERIAL.
THE STYLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND OTHER NON AMERICAN PLACES IS CALLED BRITISH STYLE 
LOGICAL QUOTATION 
OR LOGICAL PUNCTUATION. IT INCLUDES INSIDE QUOTATION MARKS ONLY THOSE PUNCTUATION MARKS WHICH APPEARED IN THE ORIGINAL QUOTED MATERIAL. OTHERWISE IT PLACES PUNCTUATION OUTSIDE THE CLOSING QUOTATION MARKS. FOWLER S A DICTIONARY OF MODERN ENGLISH USAGE PROVIDES AN EARLY EXAMPLE OF THE RULE ALL SIGNS OF PUNCTUATION USED WITH WORDS IN QUOTATION MARKS MUST BE PLACED ACCORDING TO THE SENSE. 
WHEN DEALING WITH WORDS AS WORDS SHORT FORM WORKS AND SENTENCE FRAGMENTS THIS STYLE PLACES PERIODS AND COMMAS OUTSIDE THE QUOTATION MARKS 
WITH DIRECT SPEECH BRITISH PLACING DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE QUOTED STATEMENT IS COMPLETE OR A FRAGMENT. ACCORDING TO THE BRITISH STYLE GUIDE BUTCHER S COPY EDITING AMERICAN STYLE SHOULD BE USED WHEN WRITING FICTION. IN NON FICTION SOME BRITISH PUBLISHERS MAY PERMIT PLACING PUNCTUATION THAT IS NOT PART OF THE PERSON S SPEECH INSIDE THE QUOTATION MARKS BUT PREFER THAT IT BE PLACED OUTSIDE. PERIODS AND COMMAS THAT ARE PART OF THE PERSON S SPEECH ARE PERMITTED INSIDE THE QUOTATION MARKS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE MATERIAL IS FICTION.
IN THE UNITED STATES THE PREVAILING STYLE IS CALLED AMERICAN STYLE WHEREBY COMMAS AND PERIODS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS PLACED INSIDE CLOSING QUOTATION MARKS. THIS STYLE OF PUNCTUATION IS COMMON IN THE U.S. AND TO A LESSER EXTENT CANADA AS WELL. AND IS THE STYLE USUALLY RECOMMENDED BY THE CHICAGO MANUAL OF STYLE AND MOST OTHER AMERICAN STYLE GUIDES. 
WHEN DEALING WITH WORDS AS WORDS SHORT FORM WORKS AND SENTENCE FRAGMENTS STANDARD AMERICAN STYLE PLACES PERIODS AND COMMAS INSIDE THE QUOTATION MARKS 
THIS STYLE ALSO PLACES PERIODS AND COMMAS INSIDE THE QUOTATION MARKS WHEN DEALING WITH DIRECT SPEECH REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE WORK IS FICTION OR NON FICTION 
IN BOTH MAJOR STYLES REGARDLESS OF PLACEMENT ONLY ONE END MARK OR. CAN END A SENTENCE. ONLY THE PERIOD HOWEVER MAY NOT END A QUOTED SENTENCE WHEN IT DOES NOT ALSO END THE ENCLOSING SENTENCE EXCEPT FOR LITERAL TEXT 
THIS IS A COLON 
COLONS CAN BE USED AT THE BEGINNING OF A LIST. THIS IS A LIST OF ANIMALS BIRDS CATS INSECTS PIGS AND SHEEP..
COLONS CAN BE USED TO REPLACE A SEMICOLON IN BETWEEN TWO PARTS OF A SENTENCE BUT THIS IS NOT COMMON TODAY.
STANDARD ENGLISH USAGE IS TO HAVE NO SPACES BEFORE AND ONE SPACE AFTER A COLON.
A SEMICOLON LOOKS LIKE THIS 
A SEMICOLON HAS ONLY TWO USES. FIRST TO CONNECT TWO INDEPENDENT CLAUSES INTO A SINGLE SENTENCE. FOR EXAMPLE 
I COULD TELL THAT IT WAS GETTING LATE IT WAS GROWING DARKER BY THE SECOND. 
THE SECOND USE OF A SEMICOLON IS TO SEPARATE ITEMS IN A SERIES WHEN THE ITEMS CONTAIN PARENTHETICAL ELEMENTS WITHIN THEMSELVES. FOR EXAMPLE 
THE FOLLOWING CREWMEMBERS WERE ON THE BRIDGE JAMES T. KIRK CAPTAIN OF THE

A SEMICOLON IS ALSO USED WITH A CONJUNCTIVE ADVERB WHEN JOINING TWO CLAUSES. IN REALITY THIS IS THE SAME AS THE FIRST RULE BUT IT LOOKS DIFFERENT ENOUGH TO SOMETIMES CAUSE CONCERN.
FOR EXAMPLE 
HUZAIFA CONTEXT IN WHICH ALL LIFE EXISTS CONSEQUENTLY IT IS MORE THAN A POLITICAL ISSUE. 
AN ELLIPSIS IS A MARK THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS...
IT IS USED TO SHOW WHERE WORDS HAVE BEEN MISSED OUT WHEN WRITING WHAT A PERSON SAID. IT CAN ALSO BE USED TO SHOW THAT THERE IS MORE TO BE SAID BUT THE PERSON STOPPED AT THAT POINT.
A HYPHEN LOOKS LIKE THIS. HYPHENS HAVE MANY USES IN WRITING 
PUNK ROCK
PUNK ROCK OR PUNK IS A MUSIC GENRE RELATED TO ROCK MUSIC. IT IS OFTEN DESCRIBED AS HARDER LOUDER AND CRUDER THAN OTHER ROCK MUSIC. MANY PUNK ROCK SONGS HAVE LYRICS WORDS WHICH TELL ANGRY STORIES OR WHICH USE RUDE OR CONTROVERSIAL WORDS.
PUNK ROCK IS A STYLE OF MUSIC. MANY MUSICIANS AND PUNK ROCK MUSIC LISTENERS PUNK ROCKERS WANT TO PROTEST OR REBEL AGAINST THE NORMS OR RULES OF SOCIETY. PUNKS SAY THAT PEOPLE SHOULD DO IT YOURSELF WHICH MEANS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD TRY TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOALS USING THE MATERIALS IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. MANY PUNK BANDS MAKE THEIR OWN MUSIC RECORDINGS AND DISTRIBUTE THEM WITHOUT USING A MAJOR RECORD COMPANY.
MANY PUNKS HAVE STRONG POLITICAL BELIEFS. PUNK ROCK MUSICIANS ARE OFTEN MAD AT THE GOVERNMENT THE POLICE AND LAWS. MANY PUNK ROCK SONGS PROTEST INJUSTICE LIES AND UNFAIRNESS IN COUNTRIES. ALMOST ALL PUNKS ARE LEFTISTS WHO BELIEVE THAT A COUNTRY SHOULD SHARE THE PRODUCTS AND FOOD THAT IT PRODUCES WITH ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY. SOME PUNKS ARE VEGETARIAN OR VEGANS BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT ANIMALS SHOULD NOT BE KILLED FOR FOOD. SOME PUNKS ARE ANARCHISTS. VERY FEW PUNKS ARE CONSERVATIVE LIBERTARIAN OR REPUBLICAN.
MANY PUNK MUSICIANS PUT COLORED HAIR DYE IN THEIR HAIR OR PUT GEL TO MAKE IT STAND UP. THEY WEAR DISTINCTIVE CLOTHES AS A FORM OF PROTEST OR REBELLION AGAINST THE NORMS AND RULES OF SOCIETY.
PUNK ROCK DEVELOPED IN NEW YORK CITY IN THE MID 1970S. BANDS LIKE THE RAMONES TELEVISION THE HEARTBREAKERS BLONDIE AND PATTI SMITH PLAYED LOUD ANGRY SONGS. MANY BANDS PLAYED AT A CLUB CALLED CBGB S. THE MUSIC SOON SPREAD TO AUSTRALIA AND BRITAIN WERE BANDS STARTED PLAYING PUNK ROCK IN 1976 1977. BRITISH BANDS LIKE BUZZCOCKS THE CLASH THE DAMNED GENERATION X THE JAM AND SEX PISTOLS PLAYED PUNK ROCK MUSIC THAT WAS INSPIRED BY THE MUSIC BEING PLAYED IN NEW YORK AS WELL AS BY GARAGE ROCK PUB ROCK AND OTHER PROTOPUNK MUSIC.
THESE EARLY PUNKS REJECTED THE EXCESSES OF MAINSTREAM 1970S ROCK. THEY CREATED FAST HARD EDGED MUSIC WITH SHORT SONGS STRIPPED DOWN INSTRUMENTATION AND OFTEN POLITICAL ANTI ESTABLISHMENT LYRICS. THEY OFTEN DID CONTROVERSIAL THINGS SUCH AS SAYING BAD WORDS IN PUBLIC. MANY NEWSPAPERS WROTE ARTICLES ABOUT THE BAD BEHAVIOR OF PUNK ROCK MUSICIANS.
IN THE 1980S A NEW TYPE OF PUNK ROCK CALLED HARDCORE PUNK OR HARDCORE DEVELOPED. IT WAS LOUDER HARDER AND FASTER THAN THE ORIGINAL PUNK ROCK. BY THE MID 1980S HARDCORE PUNK ROCK BEGAN BEING MIXED WITH HEAVY METAL ROCK MUSIC. MANY HARDCORE BANDS BEGAN PLAYING IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE UK.
IN THE 1990S PUNK ROCK BEGAN BEING MIXED WITH POP MUSIC TO CREATE A NEW LIGHTER STYLE OF MUSIC CALLED POP PUNK. POP PUNK BANDS INCLUDE GREEN DAY AND GOOD CHARLOTTE. SOME POP PUNK BANDS MIXED PUNK ROCK STARS 
SKA MUSIC.
POP PUNK WAS STILL POPULAR IN THE 2000S. SOME PEOPLE WHO LIKE THE 1970S STYLE PUNK ROCK CRITICIZE POP PUNK BECAUSE POP PUNK IS COMMERCIALIZED.
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT PUNK ROCK IS DEAD. BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE BECAUSE THE SPIRIT LIVES ON AND MANY PUNK ROCKERS ARE AROUND TODAY.
PYRAMID
A PYRAMID IS A STRUCTURE USUALLY OF STONE BUILT IN THE SHAPE OF A PYRAMID. FROM ANCIENT TO MODERN TIMES PEOPLE IN MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE BUILT SUCH STRUCTURES.
THE WORD PYRAMID COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD PYRAMIS WHICH MEANT WHEAT CAKE. THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN WORD FOR THEM WAS SOMETHING LIKE MER. THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA WAS ONE OF THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD.
THE FIRST PYRAMIDS WERE BUILT IN 2630 B.C. THE OLDEST KNOWN PYRAMID IN SAQQARA FOR THE THIRD DYNASTYS KING DJOSER.
IN EGYPT KINGS AND QUEENS CALLED PHARAOHS WERE BURIED IN HUGE SQUARE BOTTOMED PYRAMIDS BUILT OF STONE. THEY WERE USUALLY BUILT TO BE USED AS TOMBS FOR PHARAOHS. THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS ARE VERY WELL BUILT. SOME OF THE PYRAMIDS STILL STAND TODAY.
THE OLDEST MAN MADE PYRAMID FOUND IS CALLED THE STEP PYRAMID. IT IS NEAR CAIRO EGYPT. IT WAS BUILT FOR KING DJOSER THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. LATER PYRAMIDS WERE BUILT MUCH LARGER. THE LARGEST ONE WAS THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA. IT WAS NEAR CAIRO. IT WAS THE TALLEST BUILDING IN THE WORLD UNTIL THE EIFFEL TOWER WAS BUILT IN PARIS IN 1889. THE GREAT PYRAMID WAS BUILT BY THE PHARAOH KHUFU CHEOPS FROM THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN OLD KINGDOM. HERODOTUS WAS TOLD BY HIS EGYPTIAN GUIDES THAT IT TOOK TWENTY YEARS FOR A FORCE OF 100 000 OF THE BADLY TREATED SLAVES TO BUILD THE PYRAMID WITH ANOTHER TEN YEARS TO BUILD A STONE CAUSEWAY THAT CONNECTED TO A TEMPLE IN THE VALLEY BELOW.
PEOPLE ONCE THOUGHT PYRAMIDS WERE BUILT BY SLAVES. MORE RECENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE WORKERS WHO BUILT THE PYRAMIDS WERE PAID AND WELL CARED FOR. THEY WERE LOYAL TO THE PHARAOH. INSIDE THE GREAT PYRAMID FAMOUS MAN MADE OBJECTS HAVE BEEN FOUND FROM ANCIENT TIMES. MANY VALUABLE ITEMS WERE BURIED WITH THE DEAD PHARAOHS IN THE HOPE THAT THEY WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE AFTERLIFE. PYRAMIDS USUALLY HAD TRAPS TO STOP THIEVES FROM ESCAPING EASILY. TOMB THIEVES WERE PUNISHED BY DEATH IF THEY WERE CAUGHT. HOWEVER BY 1000 BC MANY OF THE PYRAMIDS HAD BEEN ROBBED OF THEIR PRECIOUS TREASURES.
A LARGE STATUE OF A SPHINX STANDS NEAR THE PYRAMIDS AT GIZA. IT HAS THE BODY OF A LION AND THE HEAD OF A PHARAOH.
THE ANCIENT GREEKS CALLED THE GREAT PYRAMID ONE OF THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD. THERE ARE OVER 100 PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT. MOST OF THEM ARE ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE RIVER NILE. SOME EGYPTOLOGISTS HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON WHY THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN KINGS BUILT PYRAMIDS AS THEIR TOMBS. PYRAMIDS HAVE BEEN EXCAVATED FOR ABOUT THE LAST 200 YEARS.
THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS BELIEVED THAT THE EGYPTIAN PHARAOHS WENT TO THE STARS TO JOIN THEIR GODS IN THE AFTERLIFE.
THE AZTECS AND MAYANS ALSO BUILT MANY MASSIVE PYRAMIDS. NONE ARE AS OLD OR BIG AS THE OLDEST OR BIGGEST EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS. MOST OF THEM ARE STEP PYRAMIDS.
UNLIKE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WHICH WERE USED AS TOMBS FOR RULERS AND WEALTHY PEOPLE AZTEC AND MAYAN PYRAMIDS ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN USED FOR PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF HUMAN SACRIFICE.
THERE ARE ALSO ANCIENT PYRAMIDS IN OTHER PARTS OF AFRICA CENTRAL AMERICA EUROPE NORTH AMERICA AND ASIA. THERE IS A FAMOUS MODERN GLASS PYRAMID IN FRONT OF THE LOUVRE MUSEUM IN PARIS. THE LUXOR HOTEL IN LAS VEGAS NEVADA IS ALSO A GLASS PYRAMID.
QUANTUM MECHANICS
QUANTUM MECHANICS QM IS THE PART OF PHYSICS THAT TELLS HOW THE THINGS THAT MAKE UP ATOMS WORK. QM ALSO TELLS HOW ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES LIKE LIGHT WORK. IT IS ALSO CALLED QUANTUM PHYSICS OR QUANTUM THEORY.
QM IS A MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK RULES WRITTEN IN MATHS FOR MUCH OF MODERN PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY. QUANTUM MECHANICS HELPS MAKE SENSE OF THE SMALLEST THINGS IN NATURE LIKE PROTONS NEUTRONS AND ELECTRONS. COMPLEX MATHEMATICS IS USED TO STUDY SUBATOMIC PARTICLES AND ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES BECAUSE THEY ACT IN VERY STRANGE WAYS. QUANTUM MECHANICS IS IMPORTANT TO PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY.
QUANTUM IS A LATIN WORD THAT MEANS HOW MUCH. SO A QUANTUM OF ENERGY IS A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF ENERGY. LIGHT SOURCES SUCH AS CANDLES OR LASERS SHOOT OUT OR EMIT LIGHT IN BITS CALLED PHOTONS. PHOTONS ARE LIKE PACKETS. EACH ONE HAS A CERTAIN LITTLE BIT OF ENERGY.
PHOTONS ARE PARTICLES MUCH SMALLER THAN ATOMS. THE MORE PHOTONS A LAMP SHOOTS OFF THE BRIGHTER THE LIGHT. LIGHT IS A FORM OF ENERGY THAT BEHAVES LIKE THE WAVES IN WATER OR RADIO WAVES. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TOP OF ONE WAVE AND THE TOP OF THE NEXT WAVE IS CALLED A WAVELENGTH. EACH PHOTON CARRIES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OR QUANTUM OF ENERGY DEPENDING ON ITS WAVELENGTH.
A LIGHT S COLOR DEPENDS ON ITS WAVELENGTH. THE COLOR VIOLET THE BOTTOM OR INNERMOST COLOR OF THE RAINBOW HAS A WAVELENGTH OF ABOUT 400 NM NANOMETERS WHICH IS 0.00004 CENTIMETERS OR 0.000016 INCHES. PHOTONS WITH WAVELENGTHS OF 10 400 NM ARE CALLED ULTRAVIOLET OR UV LIGHT. SUCH LIGHT CANNOT BE SEEN BY THE HUMAN EYE. ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM RED LIGHT IS ABOUT 700 NM. INFRARED LIGHT IS ABOUT 700 NM TO 300 000 NM. HUMAN EYES ARE NOT SENSITIVE TO INFRARED LIGHT EITHER.
WAVELENGTHS ARE NOT ALWAYS SO SMALL. RADIO WAVES HAVE LONGER WAVELENGTHS. THE WAVELENGTHS FOR AN FM RADIO CAN BE SEVERAL METERS IN LENGTH FOR EXAMPLE STATIONS TRANSMITTING ON 99.5 FM ARE EMITTING RADIO ENERGY WITH A WAVELENGTH OF ABOUT 3 METERS WHICH IS ABOUT 10 FEET. EACH PHOTON HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENERGY RELATED TO ITS WAVELENGTH. THE SHORTER THE WAVELENGTH OF A PHOTON THE GREATER ITS ENERGY. FOR EXAMPLE AN ULTRAVIOLET PHOTON HAS MORE ENERGY THAN AN INFRARED PHOTON.
WAVELENGTH AND FREQUENCY THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE WAVE CRESTS PER SECOND ARE INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL. THIS MEANS A LONGER WAVELENGTH WILL HAVE A LOWER FREQUENCY AND VICE VERSA. IF THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT IS INFRARED LOWER IN FREQUENCY THAN RED LIGHT EACH PHOTON CAN HEAT UP WHAT IT HITS. SO IF A STRONG INFRARED LAMP A HEAT LAMP IS POINTED AT A PERSON THAT PERSON WILL FEEL WARM OR EVEN HOT BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY STORED IN THE MANY PHOTONS. THE SURFACE OF THE INFRARED LAMP MAY EVEN GET HOT ENOUGH TO BURN SOMEONE WHO MAY TOUCH IT.
HUMANS CANNOT SEE INFRARED LIGHT BUT WE CAN FEEL THE RADIATION IN THE FORM OF HEAT. FOR EXAMPLE A PERSON WALKING BY A BRICK BUILDING THAT HAS BEEN HEATED BY THE SUN WILL FEEL HEAT FROM THE BUILDING WITHOUT HAVING TO TOUCH IT.
THE MATHEMATICAL FORMULATIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS ARE ABSTRACT. A MATHEMATICAL FUNCTION THE WAVEFUNCTION PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROBABILITY AMPLITUDE OF POSITION MOMENTUM AND OTHER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF A PARTICLE. MANY OF THE RESULTS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS ARE NOT EASILY VISUALIZED IN TERMS OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS.
IF THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT IS ULTRAVIOLET HIGHER IN FREQUENCY THAN VIOLET LIGHT THEN EACH PHOTON HAS A LOT OF ENERGY ENOUGH TO HURT SKIN CELLS AND CAUSE A SUNBURN. IN FACT MOST FORMS OF SUNBURN ARE NOT CAUSED BY HEAT THEY ARE CAUSED BY THE HIGH ENERGY OF THE SUN S UV RAYS DAMAGING YOUR SKIN CELLS. EVEN HIGHER FREQUENCIES OF LIGHT OR ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION CAN PENETRATE DEEPER INTO THE BODY AND CAUSE EVEN MORE DAMAGE. X RAYS AND GAMMA RAYS HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY THAT THEY CAN GO DEEP INTO THE HUMAN BODY AND KILL CELLS. HUMANS CANNOT SEE OR FEEL ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT X RAYS OR GAMMA RAYS. THEY MAY ONLY KNOW THEY HAVE BEEN UNDER SUCH HIGH FREQUENCY LIGHT WHEN THEY GET A RADIATION BURN. AREAS WHERE IT IS IMPORTANT TO KILL GERMS OFTEN USE ULTRAVIOLET LAMPS TO DESTROY BACTERIA FUNGI ETC. X RAYS AND GAMMA RAYS ARE SOMETIMES USED TO KILL CANCER CELLS.
QUANTUM MECHANICS STARTED WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A CERTAIN FREQUENCY MEANS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENERGY. ENERGY IS PROPORTIONAL TO FREQUENCY E F. THE HIGHER THE FREQUENCY THE MORE ENERGY A PHOTON HAS AND THE MORE DAMAGE IT CAN DO. QUANTUM MECHANICS LATER GREW TO EXPLAIN THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF ATOMS. QUANTUM MECHANICS ALSO EXPLAINS THE WAY THAT A PHOTON CAN INTERFERE WITH ITSELF AND MANY OTHER THINGS NEVER IMAGINED IN CLASSICAL PHYSICS.
MAX PLANCK DISCOVERED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FREQUENCY AND ENERGY. NOBODY BEFORE HAD EVER GUESSED THAT FREQUENCY WOULD BE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO ENERGY THIS MEANS THAT AS ONE OF THEM DOUBLES THE OTHER DOES TOO. IF WE CHOOSE TO USE WHAT ARE CALLED NATURAL UNITS THEN THE NUMBER REPRESENTING THE FREQUENCY OF A PHOTON WOULD ALSO REPRESENT ITS ENERGY. THE EQUATION WOULD THEN BE 
MEANING ENERGY EQUALS FREQUENCY.
BUT THE WAY PHYSICS GREW THERE WAS NO NATURAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE UNITS THEN USED TO MEASURE ENERGY AND THE UNITS COMMONLY USED TO MEASURE TIME AND THEREFORE FREQUENCY. SO THE FORMULA THAT PLANCK WORKED OUT TO MAKE THE NUMBERS ALL COME OUT RIGHT WAS 
OR ENERGY EQUALS H TIMES FREQUENCY. THIS H IS A NUMBER CALLED PLANCK S CONSTANT AFTER ITS DISCOVERER.
QUANTUM MECHANICS IS BASED ON THE KNOWLEDGE THAT A PHOTON OF A CERTAIN FREQUENCY MEANS A PHOTON OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENERGY. BESIDES THAT RELATIONSHIP A SPECIFIC KIND OF ATOM CAN ONLY GIVE OFF CERTAIN FREQUENCIES OF RADIATION SO IT CAN ALSO ONLY GIVE OFF PHOTONS THAT HAVE CERTAIN AMOUNTS OF ENERGY.
ISAAC NEWTON THOUGHT THAT LIGHT WAS MADE OF VERY SMALL THINGS THAT WE WOULD NOW CALL PARTICLES HE REFERRED TO THEM AS CORPUSCLES. CHRISTIAAN HUYGENS THOUGHT THAT LIGHT WAS MADE OF WAVES. SCIENTISTS THOUGHT THAT A THING CANNOT BE A PARTICLE AND A WAVE AT THE SAME TIME.
SCIENTISTS DID EXPERIMENTS TO FIND OUT WHETHER LIGHT WAS MADE OF PARTICLES OR WAVES. THEY FOUND OUT THAT BOTH IDEAS WERE RIGHT LIGHT WAS SOMEHOW BOTH WAVES AND PARTICLES. THE DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT PERFORMED BY THOMAS YOUNG SHOWED THAT LIGHT MUST ACT LIKE A WAVE. THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT DISCOVERED BY ALBERT EINSTEIN PROVED THAT LIGHT HAD TO ACT LIKE PARTICLES THAT CARRIED SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF ENERGY AND THAT THE ENERGIES WERE LINKED TO THEIR FREQUENCIES. THIS EXPERIMENTAL RESULT IS CALLED THE WAVE PARTICLE DUALITY IN QUANTUM MECHANICS. LATER PHYSICISTS FOUND OUT THAT EVERYTHING BEHAVES BOTH LIKE A WAVE AND LIKE A PARTICLE NOT JUST LIGHT. HOWEVER THIS EFFECT IS MUCH SMALLER IN LARGE OBJECTS.
HERE ARE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO DISCOVERED THE BASIC PARTS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS MAX PLANCK ALBERT EINSTEIN SATYENDRA NATH BOSE NIELS BOHR LOUIS DE BROGLIE MAX BORN PAUL DIRAC WERNER HEISENBERG WOLFGANG PAULI ERWIN SCHR DINGER JOHN VON NEUMANN AND RICHARD FEYNMAN. THEY DID THEIR WORK IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY.
QUANTUM MECHANICS FORMULAS AND IDEAS WERE MADE TO EXPLAIN THE LIGHT THAT COMES FROM GLOWING HYDROGEN. THE QUANTUM THEORY OF THE ATOM ALSO HAD TO EXPLAIN WHY THE ELECTRON STAYS IN ITS ORBIT WHICH OTHER IDEAS WERE NOT ABLE TO EXPLAIN. IT FOLLOWED FROM THE OLDER IDEAS THAT THE ELECTRON WOULD HAVE TO FALL IN TO THE CENTER OF THE ATOM BECAUSE IT STARTS OUT BEING KEPT IN ORBIT BY ITS OWN ENERGY BUT IT WOULD QUICKLY LOSE ITS ENERGY AS IT REVOLVES IN ITS ORBIT. THIS IS BECAUSE ELECTRONS AND OTHER CHARGED PARTICLES WERE KNOWN TO EMIT LIGHT AND LOSE ENERGY WHEN THEY CHANGED SPEED OR TURNED. 
HYDROGEN LAMPS WORK LIKE NEON LIGHTS BUT NEON LIGHTS HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE GROUP OF COLORS AND FREQUENCIES OF LIGHT. SCIENTISTS LEARNED THAT THEY COULD IDENTIFY ALL ELEMENTS BY THE LIGHT COLORS THEY PRODUCE. THEY JUST COULD NOT FIGURE OUT HOW THE FREQUENCIES WERE DETERMINED.
THEN A SWISS MATHEMATICIAN NAMED JOHANN BALMER FIGURED OUT AN EQUATION THAT TOLD WHAT LAMBDA FOR WAVE LENGTH WOULD BE 
WHERE B IS A NUMBER THAT BALMER DETERMINED TO BE EQUAL TO 364.56 NM.
THIS EQUATION ONLY WORKED FOR THE VISIBLE LIGHT FROM A HYDROGEN LAMP. BUT LATER THE EQUATION WAS MADE MORE GENERAL 
WHERE R IS THE RYDBERG CONSTANT EQUAL TO 0.0110 NM AND N MUST BE GREATER THAN M.
PUTTING IN DIFFERENT NUMBERS FOR M AND N IT IS EASY TO PREDICT FREQUENCIES FOR MANY TYPES OF LIGHT ULTRAVIOLET VISIBLE AND INFARED. TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS GO TO HYPERPHYSICS AND GO DOWN PAST THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE. USE H 1 FOR HYDROGEN. 
IN 1908 WALTER RITZ MADE THE RITZ COMBINATION PRINCIPLE THAT SHOWS HOW CERTAIN GAPS BETWEEN FREQUENCIES KEEP REPEATING THEMSELVES. THIS TURNED OUT TO BE IMPORTANT TO WERNER HEISENBERG SEVERAL YEARS LATER.
IN 1905 ALBERT EINSTEIN USED PLANCK S IDEA TO SHOW THAT A BEAM OF LIGHT IS MADE UP OF A STREAM OF PARTICLES CALLED PHOTONS. THE ENERGY OF EACH PHOTON DEPENDS ON ITS FREQUENCY. EINSTEIN S IDEA IS THE BEGINNING OF THE IDEA IN QUANTUM MECHANICS THAT ALL SUBATOMIC PARTICLES LIKE ELECTRONS PROTONS NEUTRONS AND OTHERS ARE BOTH WAVES AND PARTICLES AT THE SAME TIME. SEE PICTURE OF ATOM WITH THE ELECTRON AS WAVES AT ATOM. THIS LED TO A THEORY ABOUT SUBATOMIC PARTICLES AND ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES CALLED WAVE PARTICLE DUALITY. THIS IS WHERE PARTICLES AND WAVES WERE NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER BUT HAD CERTAIN PROPERTIES OF BOTH.
IN 1913 NIELS BOHR HAD A NEW IDEA. MAYBE ELECTRONS COULD ONLY TAKE UP CERTAIN ORBITS AROUND THE NUCLEUS OF AN ATOM. THE NUMBERS CALLED M AND N IN THE EQUATION ABOVE COULD REPRESENT ORBITS. AN ELECTRON COULD BEGIN IN SOME ORBIT M AND END UP IN SOME ORBIT N OR AN ELECTRON COULD BEGIN IN SOME ORBIT N AND END UP IN SOME ORBIT M. SO IF A PHOTON HITS AN ELECTRON ITS ENERGY WILL BE ABSORBED AND THE ELECTRON WILL MOVE TO A HIGHER ORBIT BECAUSE OF THAT EXTRA ENERGY. AND IF AN ELECTRON FALLS FROM A HIGHER ORBIT TO A LOWER ORBIT THEN IT WILL HAVE TO GIVE UP ENERGY IN THE FORM OF A PHOTON. THE ENERGY OF THE PHOTON WILL EQUAL THE ENERGY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO ORBITS AND THE ENERGY OF A PHOTON MAKES IT HAVE A CERTAIN FREQUENCY AND COLOR. EVERYTHING WORKED OUT VERY WELL THAT WAY BUT THERE WAS ONE BIG QUESTION LEFT EACH OF THE COLORS OF LIGHT PRODUCED BY GLOWING HYDROGEN AND BY GLOWING NEON OR ANY OTHER ELEMENT HAS A BRIGHTNESS OF ITS OWN AND THE BRIGHTNESS DIFFERENCES ARE ALWAYS THE SAME FOR EACH ELEMENT. WHY 
AT THIS POINT MOST THINGS ABOUT THE LIGHT PRODUCED BY A HYDROGEN LAMP WERE KNOWN. ONE BIG PROBLEM REMAINED HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN THE BRIGHTNESS OF EACH OF THE LINES PRODUCED BY GLOWING HYDROGEN 
WERNER HEISENBERG TOOK ON THE JOB OF EXPLAINING THE BRIGHTNESS OR INTENSITY OF EACH LINE. HE COULD NOT USE ANY SIMPLE RULE LIKE THE ONE BALMER HAD COME UP WITH. HE HAD TO USE THE VERY DIFFICULT MATH OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS THAT FIGURES EVERYTHING OUT IN TERMS OF THINGS LIKE THE MASS WEIGHT OF AN ELECTRON THE CHARGE STATIC ELECTRIC STRENGTH OF AN ELECTRON AND OTHER TINY QUANTITIES. CLASSICAL PHYSICS ALREADY HAD ANSWERS FOR THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE BANDS OF COLOR THAT A HYDROGEN LAMP PRODUCES BUT THE CLASSICAL THEORY SAID THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CONTINUOUS RAINBOW AND NOT FOUR SEPARATE COLOR BANDS. HEISENBERG S EXPLANATION IS 
THERE IS SOME LAW THAT SAYS WHAT FREQUENCIES OF LIGHT GLOWING HYDROGEN WILL PRODUCE. IT HAS TO PREDICT SPACED OUT FREQUENCIES WHEN THE ELECTRONS INVOLVED ARE MOVING BETWEEN ORBITS CLOSE TO THE NUCLEUS CENTER OF THE ATOM BUT IT ALSO HAS TO PREDICT THAT THE FREQUENCIES WILL GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER AS WE LOOK AT WHAT THE ELECTRON DOES IN MOVING BETWEEN ORBITS FARTHER AND FARTHER OUT. IT WILL ALSO PREDICT THAT THE INTENSITY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FREQUENCIES GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER AS WE GO OUT. WHERE CLASSICAL PHYSICS ALREADY GIVES THE RIGHT ANSWERS BY ONE SET OF EQUATIONS THE NEW PHYSICS HAS TO GIVE THE SAME ANSWERS BUT BY DIFFERENT EQUATIONS.
CLASSICAL PHYSICS USES THE METHODS OF THE FRENCH MATHEMATICIAN FOURIER TO MAKE A MATH PICTURE OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND IT USES COLLECTIONS OF SMOOTH CURVES THAT GO TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE SMOOTH CURVE THAT GIVES IN THIS CASE INTENSITIES FOR LIGHT OF ALL FREQUENCIES FROM SOME LIGHT. BUT IT IS NOT RIGHT BECAUSE THAT SMOOTH CURVE ONLY APPEARS AT HIGHER FREQUENCIES. AT LOWER FREQUENCIES THERE ARE ALWAYS ISOLATED POINTS AND NOTHING CONNECTS THE DOTS. SO TO MAKE A MAP OF THE REAL WORLD HEISENBERG HAD TO MAKE A BIG CHANGE. HE HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO PICK OUT ONLY THE NUMBERS THAT WOULD MATCH WHAT WAS SEEN IN NATURE. SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY HE GUESSED THESE EQUATIONS BUT HE WAS NOT MAKING BLIND GUESSES. HE FOUND WHAT HE NEEDED. THE NUMBERS THAT HE CALCULATED WOULD PUT DOTS ON A GRAPH BUT THERE WOULD BE NO LINE DRAWN BETWEEN THE DOTS. AND MAKING ONE GRAPH JUST OF DOTS FOR EVERY SET OF CALCULATIONS WOULD HAVE WASTED LOTS OF PAPER AND NOT HAVE GOTTEN ANYTHING DONE. HEISENBERG FOUND A WAY TO EFFICIENTLY PREDICT THE INTENSITIES FOR DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES AND TO ORGANIZE THAT INFORMATION IN A HELPFUL WAY.
JUST USING THE EMPIRICAL RULE GIVEN ABOVE THE ONE THAT BALMER GOT STARTED AND RYDBERG IMPROVED WE CAN SEE HOW TO GET ONE SET OF NUMBERS THAT WOULD HELP HEISENBERG GET THE KIND OF PICTURE THAT HE WANTED 
THE RULE SAYS THAT WHEN THE ELECTRON MOVES FROM ONE ORBIT TO ANOTHER IT EITHER GAINS OR LOSES ENERGY DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT IS GETTING FARTHER FROM THE CENTER OR NEARER TO IT. SO WE CAN PUT THESE ORBITS OR ENERGY LEVELS IN AS HEADINGS ALONG THE TOP AND THE SIDE OF A GRID. FOR HISTORICAL REASONS THE LOWEST ORBIT IS CALLED N AND THE NEXT ORBIT OUT IS CALLED N A THEN COMES N B AND SO FORTH. IT IS CONFUSING THAT THEY USED NEGATIVE NUMBERS WHEN THE ELECTRONS WERE ACTUALLY GAINING ENERGY BUT THAT IS JUST THE WAY IT IS.
SINCE THE RYDBERG RULE GIVES US FREQUENCIES WE CAN USE THAT RULE TO PUT IN NUMBERS DEPENDING ON WHERE THE ELECTRON GOES. IF THE ELECTRON STARTS AT N AND ENDS UP AT N THEN IT HAS NOT REALLY GONE ANYWHERE SO IT DID NOT GAIN ENERGY AND IT DID NOT LOSE ENERGY. SO THE FREQUENCY IS 0. IF THE ELECTRON STARTS AT N A AND ENDS UP AT N THEN IT HAS FALLEN FROM A HIGHER ORBIT TO A LOWER ORBIT. IF IT DOES SO THEN IT LOSES ENERGY AND THE ENERGY IT LOSES SHOWS UP AS A PHOTON. THE PHOTON HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENERGY E AND THAT IS RELATED TO A CERTAIN FREQUENCY F BY THE EQUATION E H F. SO WE KNOW THAT A CERTAIN CHANGE OF ORBIT IS GOING TO PRODUCE A CERTAIN FREQUENCY OF LIGHT F. IF THE ELECTRON STARTS AT N AND ENDS UP AT N A THAT MEANS IT HAS GONE FROM A LOWER ORBIT TO A HIGHER ORBIT. THAT ONLY HAPPENS WHEN A PHOTON OF A CERTAIN FREQUENCY AND ENERGY COMES IN FROM THE OUTSIDE IS ABSORBED BY THE ELECTRON AND GIVES IT ITS ENERGY AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE ELECTRON GO OUT TO A HIGHER ORBIT. SO TO KEEP EVERYTHING MAKING SENSE WE WRITE THAT FREQUENCY AS A NEGATIVE NUMBER. THERE WAS A PHOTON WITH A CERTAIN FREQUENCY AND NOW IT HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY.
SO WE CAN MAKE A GRID LIKE THIS WHERE F A B MEANS THE FREQUENCY INVOLVED WHEN AN ELECTRON GOES FROM ENERGY STATE ORBIT B TO ENERGY STATE A AGAIN SEQUENCES LOOK BACKWARDS BUT THAT IS THE WAY THEY WERE ORIGINALLY WRITTEN. 
GRID OF F
HEISENBERG DID NOT MAKE THE GRIDS LIKE THIS. HE JUST DID THE MATH THAT WOULD LET HIM GET THE INTENSITIES HE WAS LOOKING FOR. BUT TO DO THAT HE HAD TO MULTIPLY TWO AMPLITUDES HOW HIGH A WAVE MEASURES TO WORK OUT THE INTENSITY. IN CLASSICAL PHYSICS INTENSITY EQUALS AMPLITUDE SQUARED. HE MADE AN ODD LOOKING EQUATION TO HANDLE THIS PROBLEM WROTE OUT THE REST OF HIS PAPER HANDED IT TO HIS BOSS AND WENT ON VACATION. DR. BORN LOOKED AT HIS FUNNY EQUATION AND IT SEEMED A LITTLE CRAZY. HE MUST HAVE WONDERED WHY DID HEISENBERG GIVE ME THIS STRANGE THING WHY DOES HE HAVE TO DO IT THIS WAY THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT A BLUEPRINT FOR SOMETHING HE ALREADY KNEW VERY WELL. HE WAS USED TO CALLING THE GRID OR TABLE THAT WE COULD WRITE BY DOING FOR INSTANCE ALL THE MATH FOR FREQUENCIES A MATRIX. AND HEISENBERG S WEIRD EQUATION WAS A RULE FOR MULTIPLYING TWO OF THEM TOGETHER. MAX BORN WAS A VERY VERY GOOD MATHEMATICIAN. HE KNEW THAT SINCE THE TWO MATRICES GRIDS BEING MULTIPLIED REPRESENTED DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE POSITION X Y Z AND MOMENTUM MV FOR INSTANCE THEN WHEN YOU MULTIPLY THE FIRST MATRIX BY THE SECOND YOU GET ONE ANSWER AND WHEN YOU MULTIPLY THE SECOND MATRIX BY THE FIRST MATRIX YOU GET ANOTHER ANSWER. EVEN THOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT MATRIX MATH HEISENBERG ALREADY SAW THIS DIFFERENT ANSWERS PROBLEM AND IT HAD BOTHERED HIM. BUT DR. BORN WAS SUCH A GOOD MATHEMATICIAN THAT HE SAW THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIRST MATRIX MULTIPLICATION AND THE SECOND MATRIX MULTIPLICATION WAS ALWAYS GOING TO INVOLVE PLANCK S CONSTANT H MULTIPLIED BY THE SQUARE ROOT OF NEGATIVE ONE I. SO WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF HEISENBERG S DISCOVERY THEY ALREADY HAD THE BASIC MATH FOR WHAT HEISENBERG LIKED TO CALL THE INDETERMINACY PRINCIPLE. BY INDETERMINATE HEISENBERG MEANT THAT SOMETHING LIKE AN ELECTRON IS JUST NOT PINNED DOWN UNTIL IT GETS PINNED DOWN. IT IS A LITTLE LIKE A JELLYFISH THAT IS ALWAYS SQUISHING AROUND AND CANNOT BE IN ONE PLACE UNLESS YOU KILL IT. LATER PEOPLE GOT IN THE HABIT OF CALLING IT HEISENBERG S UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE WHICH MADE MANY PEOPLE MAKE THE MISTAKE OF THINKING THAT ELECTRONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE REALLY SOMEWHERE BUT WE ARE JUST UNCERTAIN ABOUT IT IN OUR OWN MINDS. THAT IDEA IS WRONG. IT IS NOT WHAT HEISENBERG WAS TALKING ABOUT. HAVING TROUBLE MEASURING SOMETHING IS A PROBLEM BUT IT IS NOT THE PROBLEM HEISENBERG WAS TALKING ABOUT.
HEISENBERG S IDEA IS VERY HARD TO GRASP BUT WE CAN MAKE IT CLEARER WITH AN EXAMPLE. FIRST WE WILL START CALLING THESE GRIDS MATRICES BECAUSE WE WILL SOON NEED TO TALK ABOUT MATRIX MULTIPLICATION.
SUPPOSE THAT WE START WITH TWO KINDS OF MEASUREMENTS POSITION Q AND MOMENTUM P. IN 1925 HEISENBERG WROTE AN EQUATION LIKE THIS ONE 
HE DID NOT KNOW IT BUT THIS EQUATION GIVES A BLUEPRINT FOR WRITING OUT TWO MATRICES GRIDS AND FOR MULTIPLYING THEM. THE RULES FOR MULTIPLYING ONE MATRIX BY ANOTHER ARE A LITTLE MESSY BUT HERE ARE THE TWO MATRICES ACCORDING TO THE BLUEPRINT AND THEN THEIR PRODUCT 
MATRIX OF P
MATRIX OF Q
THE MATRIX FOR THE PRODUCT OF THE ABOVE TWO MATRICES AS SPECIFIED BY THE RELEVANT EQUATION IN HEISENBERG S 1925 PAPER IS 
WHERE 
A P N N A Q N A N B P N N B Q N B N B P N N C Q N C N B...
B P N A N A Q N A N C P N A N B Q N B N C P N A N C Q N C N C...
C P N B N A Q N A N D P N B N B Q N B N D P N B N C Q N D N D...
AND SO FORTH.
IF THE MATRICES WERE REVERSED THE FOLLOWING VALUES WOULD RESULT 
A Q N N A P N A N B Q N N B P N B N B Q N N C P N C N B...
B Q N A N A P N A N C Q N A N B P N B N C Q N A N C P N C N C...
C Q N B N A P N A N D Q N B N B P N B N D Q N B N C P N D N D...
AND SO FORTH.
NOTE HOW CHANGING THE ORDER OF MULTIPLICATION CHANGES THE NUMBERS STEP BY STEP THAT ARE ACTUALLY MULTIPLIED.
THE WORK OF WERNER HEISENBERG SEEMED TO BREAK A LOG JAM. VERY SOON MANY DIFFERENT OTHER WAYS OF EXPLAINING THINGS CAME FROM PEOPLE SUCH AS LOUIS DE BROGLIE MAX BORN PAUL DIRAC WOLFGANG PAULI AND ERWIN SCHR DINGER. THE WORK OF EACH OF THESE PHYSICISTS IS ITS OWN STORY. THE MATH USED BY HEISENBERG AND EARLIER PEOPLE IS NOT VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND BUT THE EQUATIONS QUICKLY GREW VERY COMPLICATED AS PHYSICISTS LOOKED MORE DEEPLY INTO THE ATOMIC WORLD.
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS ALBERT EINSTEIN SUGGESTED THAT IF IT WERE RIGHT THEN QUANTUM MECHANICS WOULD MEAN THAT THERE WOULD BE SPOOKY ACTION AT A DISTANCE. IT TURNED OUT THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS WAS RIGHT AND THAT WHAT EINSTEIN HAD USED AS A REASON TO REJECT QUANTUM MECHANICS ACTUALLY HAPPENED. THIS KIND OF SPOOKY CONNECTION BETWEEN CERTAIN QUANTUM EVENTS IS NOW CALLED QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT.
WHEN AN EXPERIMENT BRINGS TWO THINGS PHOTONS ELECTRONS ETC. TOGETHER THEY MUST THEN SHARE A COMMON DESCRIPTION IN QUANTUM MECHANICS. WHEN THEY ARE LATER SEPARATED THEY KEEP THE SAME QUANTUM MECHANICAL DESCRIPTION OR STATE. IN THE DIAGRAM ONE CHARACTERISTIC E.G. UP SPIN IS DRAWN IN RED AND ITS MATE E.G. DOWN SPIN IS DRAWN IN BLUE. THE PURPLE BAND MEANS THAT WHEN E.G. TWO ELECTRONS ARE PUT TOGETHER THE PAIR SHARES BOTH CHARACTERISTICS. SO BOTH ELECTRONS COULD SHOW EITHER UP SPIN OR DOWN SPIN. WHEN THEY ARE LATER SEPARATED ONE REMAINING ON EARTH AND ONE GOING TO SOME PLANET OF THE STAR ALPHA CENTAURI THEY STILL EACH HAVE BOTH SPINS. IN OTHER WORDS EACH ONE OF THEM CAN DECIDE TO SHOW ITSELF AS A SPIN UP ELECTRON OR A SPIN DOWN ELECTRON. BUT IF LATER ON SOMEONE MEASURES THE OTHER ONE IT MUST DECIDE TO SHOW ITSELF AS HAVING THE OPPOSITE SPIN.
EINSTEIN ARGUED THAT OVER SUCH A GREAT DISTANCE IT WAS CRAZY TO THINK THAT FORCING ONE ELECTRON TO SHOW ITS SPIN WOULD THEN SOMEHOW MAKE THE OTHER ELECTRON SHOW AN OPPOSITE CHARACTERISTIC. HE SAID THAT THE TWO ELECTRONS MUST HAVE BEEN SPIN UP OR SPIN DOWN ALL ALONG BUT THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS COULD NOT PREDICT WHICH CHARACTERISTIC EACH ELECTRON HAD. BEING UNABLE TO PREDICT ONLY BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT ONE OF THEM WITH THE RIGHT EXPERIMENT MEANT THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR SOMETHING IMPORTANT. THEREFORE EINSTEIN SAID QUANTUM MECHANICS HAD A BIG HOLE IN IT. QUANTUM MECHANICS WAS INCOMPLETE.
LATER IT TURNED OUT THAT EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT IT WAS EINSTEIN WHO WAS WRONG.
IN 1925 WERNER HEISENBERG DESCRIBED THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE WHICH SAYS THAT THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT WHERE A PARTICLE IS THE LESS WE CAN KNOW ABOUT HOW FAST IT IS GOING AND IN WHICH DIRECTION. IN OTHER WORDS THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT THE SPEED AND DIRECTION OF SOMETHING SMALL THE LESS WE CAN KNOW ABOUT ITS POSITION. PHYSICISTS USUALLY TALK ABOUT THE MOMENTUM IN SUCH DISCUSSIONS INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT SPEED. MOMENTUM IS JUST THE SPEED OF SOMETHING IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION TIMES ITS MASS.
THE REASON BEHIND HEISENBERG S UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE SAYS THAT WE CAN NEVER KNOW BOTH THE LOCATION AND THE MOMENTUM OF A PARTICLE. BECAUSE LIGHT IS AN ABUNDANT PARTICLE IT IS USED FOR MEASURING OTHER PARTICLES. THE ONLY WAY TO MEASURE IT IS TO BOUNCE THE LIGHT WAVE OFF OF THE PARTICLE AND RECORD THE RESULTS. IF A HIGH ENERGY OR HIGH FREQUENCY LIGHT BEAM IS USED WE CAN TELL PRECISELY WHERE IT IS BUT CANNOT TELL HOW FAST IT WAS GOING. THIS IS BECAUSE THE HIGH ENERGY PHOTON TRANSFERS ENERGY TO THE PARTICLE AND CHANGES THE PARTICLE S SPEED. IF WE USE A LOW ENERGY PHOTON WE CAN TELL HOW FAST IT IS GOING BUT NOT WHERE IT IS. THIS IS BECAUSE WE ARE USING LIGHT WITH A LONGER WAVELENGTH. THE LONGER WAVELENGTH MEANS THE PARTICLE COULD BE ANYWHERE ALONG THE STRETCH OF THE WAVE.
THE PRINCIPLE ALSO SAYS THAT THERE ARE MANY PAIRS OF MEASUREMENTS FOR WHICH WE CANNOT KNOW BOTH OF THEM ABOUT ANY PARTICLE A VERY SMALL THING NO MATTER HOW HARD WE TRY. THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT ONE OF SUCH A PAIR THE LESS WE CAN KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER.
EVEN ALBERT EINSTEIN HAD TROUBLE ACCEPTING SUCH A BIZARRE CONCEPT AND IN A WELL KNOWN DEBATE SAID GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE.
TO THIS DANISH PHYSICIST NIELS BOHR FAMOUSLY RESPONDED EINSTEIN DON T TELL GOD WHAT TO DO.
ELECTRONS SURROUND EVERY ATOM S NUCLEUS. CHEMICAL BONDS LINK ATOMS TO FORM MOLECULES. A CHEMICAL BOND LINKS TWO ATOMS WHEN ELECTRONS ARE SHARED BETWEEN THOSE ATOMS. THUS QM IS THE PHYSICS OF THE CHEMICAL BOND AND OF CHEMISTRY. QM HELPS US UNDERSTAND HOW MOLECULES ARE MADE AND WHAT THEIR PROPERTIES ARE.
QM CAN ALSO HELP US UNDERSTAND BIG THINGS SUCH AS STARS AND EVEN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE. QM IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE THEORY OF HOW THE UNIVERSE BEGAN CALLED THE BIG BANG.
EVERYTHING MADE OF MATTER IS ATTRACTED TO OTHER MATTER BECAUSE OF A FUNDAMENTAL FORCE CALLED GRAVITY. EINSTEIN S THEORY THAT EXPLAINS GRAVITY IS CALLED THE THEORY OF GENERAL RELATIVITY. A PROBLEM IN MODERN PHYSICS IS THAT SOME CONCLUSIONS OF QM DO NOT SEEM TO AGREE WITH THE THEORY OF GENERAL RELATIVITY.
QM IS THE PART OF PHYSICS THAT CAN EXPLAIN WHY ALL ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY WORKS AS IT DOES. THUS QM EXPLAINS HOW COMPUTERS WORK BECAUSE COMPUTERS ARE ELECTRONIC MACHINES. BUT THE DESIGNERS OF THE EARLY COMPUTER HARDWARE OF AROUND 1950 OR 1960 DID NOT NEED TO THINK ABOUT QM. THE DESIGNERS OF RADIOS AND TELEVISIONS AT THAT TIME DID NOT THINK ABOUT QM EITHER. HOWEVER THE DESIGN OF THE MORE POWERFUL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND COMPUTER MEMORY TECHNOLOGIES OF RECENT YEARS DOES REQUIRE QM.
QM HAS ALSO MADE POSSIBLE TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS 
QM IS A CHALLENGING SUBJECT FOR SEVERAL REASONS 
QM DESCRIBES NATURE IN A WAY THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM HOW WE USUALLY THINK ABOUT SCIENCE. IT TELLS US HOW LIKELY TO HAPPEN SOME THINGS ARE RATHER THAN TELLING US THAT THEY CERTAINLY WILL HAPPEN.
ONE EXAMPLE IS YOUNG S DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT. IF WE SHOOT SINGLE PHOTONS SINGLE UNITS OF LIGHT FROM A LASER AT A SHEET OF PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM WE WILL SEE A SINGLE SPOT OF LIGHT ON THE DEVELOPED FILM. IF WE PUT A SHEET OF METAL IN BETWEEN AND MAKE TWO VERY NARROW SLITS IN THE SHEET WHEN WE FIRE MANY PHOTONS AT THE METAL SHEET AND THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SLITS THEN WE WILL SEE SOMETHING REMARKABLE. ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE SHEET OF DEVELOPED FILM WE WILL SEE A SERIES OF BRIGHT AND DARK BANDS. WE CAN USE MATHEMATICS TO TELL EXACTLY WHERE THE BRIGHT BANDS WILL BE AND HOW BRIGHT THE LIGHT WAS THAT MADE THEM THAT IS WE CAN TELL AHEAD OF TIME HOW MANY PHOTONS WILL FALL ON EACH BAND. BUT IF WE SLOW THE PROCESS DOWN AND SEE WHERE EACH PHOTON LANDS ON THE SCREEN WE CAN NEVER TELL AHEAD OF TIME WHERE THE NEXT ONE WILL SHOW UP. WE CAN KNOW FOR SURE THAT IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT A PHOTON WILL HIT THE CENTER BRIGHT BAND AND THAT IT GETS LESS AND LESS LIKELY THAT A PHOTON WILL SHOW UP AT BANDS FARTHER AND FARTHER FROM THE CENTER. SO WE KNOW FOR SURE THAT THE BANDS WILL BE BRIGHTEST AT THE CENTER AND GET DIMMER AND DIMMER FARTHER AWAY. BUT WE NEVER KNOW FOR SURE WHICH PHOTON WILL GO INTO WHICH BAND.
ONE OF THE STRANGE CONCLUSIONS OF QM THEORY IS THE SCHR DINGER S CAT EFFECT. CERTAIN PROPERTIES OF A PARTICLE SUCH AS THEIR POSITION SPEED OF MOTION DIRECTION OF MOTION AND SPIN CANNOT BE TALKED ABOUT UNTIL SOMETHING MEASURES THEM A PHOTON BOUNCING OFF OF AN ELECTRON WOULD COUNT AS A MEASUREMENT OF ITS POSITION FOR EXAMPLE. BEFORE THE MEASUREMENT THE PARTICLE IS IN A SUPERPOSITION OF STATES IN WHICH ITS PROPERTIES HAVE MANY VALUES AT THE SAME TIME. SCHR DINGER SAID THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS SEEMED TO SAY THAT IF SOMETHING SUCH AS THE LIFE OR DEATH OF A CAT WAS DETERMINED BY A QUANTUM EVENT THEN ITS STATE WOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE STATE THAT RESULTED FROM THE QUANTUM EVENT BUT ONLY AT THE TIME THAT SOMEBODY LOOKED AT THE STATE OF THE QUANTUM EVENT. IN THE TIME BEFORE THE STATE OF THE QUANTUM EVENT IS LOOKED AT PERHAPS THE LIVING AND DEAD CAT PARDON
THE EXPRESSION ARE MIXED OR SMEARED OUT IN EQUAL PARTS. 
PEOPLE OFTEN USE THE SYMBOL FORMULA 4 WHICH IS CALLED H BAR. FORMULA 5. H BAR IS A UNIT OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM. WHEN THIS NEW UNIT IS USED TO DESCRIBE THE ORBITS OF ELECTRONS IN ATOMS THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF ANY ELECTRON IN ORBIT IS ALWAYS A WHOLE NUMBER.
THE PARTICLE IN A 1 DIMENSIONAL WELL IS THE MOST SIMPLE EXAMPLE SHOWING THAT THE ENERGY OF A PARTICLE CAN ONLY HAVE SPECIFIC VALUES. THE ENERGY IS SAID TO BE QUANTIZED. 
THE WELL HAS ZERO POTENTIAL ENERGY INSIDE A RANGE AND HAS INFINITE POTENTIAL ENERGY EVERYWHERE OUTSIDE THAT RANGE. FOR THE 1 DIMENSIONAL CASE IN THE FORMULA 6 DIRECTION THE TIME INDEPENDENT SCHR DINGER EQUATION CAN BE WRITTEN AS 
USING DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS WE CAN SEE THAT FORMULA 8 MUST BE
OR
THE WALLS OF THE BOX MEAN THAT THE WAVEFUNCTION MUST HAVE A SPECIAL FORM. THE WAVEFUNCTION OF THE PARTICLE MUST BE ZERO ANYTIME THE WALLS ARE INFINITELY TALL. AT EACH WALL 
CONSIDER X 0
NOW CONSIDER FORMULA 13
WE CAN SEE THAT FORMULA 17 MUST BE AN INTEGER. THIS MEANS THAT THE PARTICLE CAN ONLY HAVE SPECIAL ENERGY VALUES AND CANNOT HAVE THE ENERGY VALUES IN BETWEEN. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF ENERGY QUANTIZATION. 
RADIOACTIVE DECAY
MOST CHEMICAL ELEMENTS ARE STABLE IF THEY ARE NOT PART OF A CHEMICAL REACTION THEY DO NOT CHANGE. CHEMICAL ELEMENTS ARE MADE OF ATOMS. IN STABLE ELEMENTS THE ATOM STAYS THE SAME. IN A CHEMICAL REACTION THE ATOMS WILL FORM CHEMICAL BONDS WITH OTHER ATOMS. EVEN IF THE BONDS CHANGE DURING A REACTION THE ATOMS THEMSELVES DO NOT.
IN THE 19TH CENTURY HENRI BECQUEREL DISCOVERED THAT SOME CHEMICAL ELEMENTS HAVE ATOMS THAT CHANGE DURING THEIR CHANGE THEY SEND OUT A PARTICLE. IN 1898 MARIE AND PIERRE CURIE CALLED THIS PHENOMENON RADIOACTIVE DECAY. BECQUEREL AND THE CURIES WERE AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS FOR THIS DISCOVERY IN 1903.
MOST CARBON ATOMS HAVE SIX PROTONS AND SIX NEUTRONS IN THEIR NUCLEUS. THIS CARBON IS CALLED CARBON 12 BECAUSE 12 IS THE NUMBER OF PROTONS PLUS THE NUMBER OF NEUTRONS IN THE CARBON 12 NUCLEUS SIX PROTONS SIX NEUTRONS 12. ITS ATOMIC WEIGHT IS 12. IF A CARBON ATOM HAS TWO MORE NEUTRONS IT IS CARBON 14. CARBON 14 ACTS CHEMICALLY LIKE OTHER CARBON BECAUSE THE SIX PROTONS AND SIX ELECTRONS ARE WHAT GOVERN ITS CHEMICAL PROPERTIES. IN FACT CARBON 14 EXISTS IN ALL LIVING THINGS ALL PLANTS AND ANIMALS CONTAIN CARBON 14. HOWEVER CARBON 14 IS RADIOACTIVE. IT DECAYS BY BETA DECAY. IT CAN BE DETECTED AND MEASURED. CARBON 14 IN THE SMALL AMOUNTS FOUND ABOUT US IN NATURE IS HARMLESS. IN ARCHEOLOGY THIS KIND OF CARBON IS USED TO DETERMINE THE AGE OF WOOD AND OTHER FORMERLY LIVING THINGS. THE METHOD IS CALLED RADIOCARBON DATING WHICH IS ONE KIND OF RADIOMETRIC DATING.
ERNEST RUTHERFORD FOUND THAT THERE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THESE PARTICLES PENETRATE MATTER. HE FOUND TWO DIFFERENT KINDS WHICH HE CALLED ALPHA DECAY AND BETA DECAY. PAUL VILLARD DISCOVERED A THIRD KIND IN 1900. RUTHERFORD CALLED IT GAMMA DECAY IN 1903.
OTHER KINDS OF DECAY WERE DISCOVERED LATER. THE TYPES OF DECAY ARE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER BECAUSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DECAY PRODUCE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PARTICLES. THE STARTING RADIOACTIVE NUCLEUS IS CALLED THE PARENT NUCLEUS AND THE NUCLEUS THAT IT CHANGES INTO IS CALLED THE DAUGHTER NUCLEUS. THE HIGH ENERGY PARTICLES PRODUCED BY RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS ARE CALLED RADIATION.
THESE VARIOUS KINDS OF DECAY CAN HAPPEN SEQUENTIALLY IN A DECAY CHAIN. ONE KIND OF NUCLEUS DECAYS TO ANOTHER KIND WHICH DECAYS AGAIN TO ANOTHER AND SO ON UNTIL IT BECOMES A STABLE ISOTOPE AND THE CHAIN COMES TO AN END.
THE SPEED AT WHICH THIS CHANGE HAPPENS IS DIFFERENT FOR EACH ELEMENT. RADIOACTIVE DECAY IS GOVERNED BY CHANCE THE TIME IT TAKES ON AVERAGE FOR HALF THE ATOMS OF A SUBSTANCE TO CHANGE IS NAMED THE HALF LIFE. THE RATE IS GIVEN BY AN EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION. AS AN EXAMPLE IODINE I HAS A HALF LIFE OF ABOUT 8 DAYS. THAT OF PLUTONIUM RANGES BETWEEN 4 HOURS PU AND 80 MILLION YEARS PU 
THE RATE OF DECAY IS CALCULATED USING EQUATIONS. AN EQUATION HAS A NUCLIDE ON THE LEFT A RIGHT POINTING ARROW AND THE REACTION PRODUCTS OF THE DECAY ON THE RIGHT. THE EQUATION MUST BE BALANCED TO FOLLOW THE CONSERVATION LAWS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS FOR NUCLEAR REACTIONS. CERTAIN THINGS ARE NOT CHANGED BY DECAY. THSES ARE CALLED CONSERVED ENTITIES. THE CONSERVED ENTITIES ARE TOTAL ENERGY INCLUDING MASS NUMBER OF NUCLEONS LINEAR AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND LEPTON NUMBER. THE PARTICLES OR NUCLEI IN THE EQUATION ARE WRITTEN WITH A SUPERSCRIPT TO SHOW MASS NUMBER A AND A SUBSCRIPT TO DENOTE ATOMIC NUMBER Z. 
RADIOACTIVE DECAY CHANGES AN ATOM FROM ONE THAT HAS HIGHER ENERGY INSIDE ITS NUCLEUS INTO ONE WITH LOWER ENERGY. THE CHANGE OF ENERGY OF THE NUCLEUS IS GIVEN TO THE PARTICLES THAT ARE CREATED. THE ENERGY RELEASED BY RADIOACTIVE DECAY MAY EITHER BE CARRIED AWAY BY A GAMMA RAY ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION A TYPE OF LIGHT A BETA PARTICLE OR AN ALPHA PARTICLE. IN ALL THOSE CASES THE CHANGE OF ENERGY OF THE NUCLEUS IS CARRIED AWAY. AND IN ALL THOSE CASES THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHARGES OF THE ATOM S PROTONS AND ELECTRONS SUM TO ZERO BEFORE AND AFTER THE CHANGE.
DURING ALPHA DECAY THE ATOMIC NUCLEUS RELEASES AN ALPHA PARTICLE. ALPHA DECAY CAUSES THE NUCLEUS TO LOSE TWO PROTONS AND TWO NEUTRONS. ALPHA DECAY CAUSES THE ATOM TO CHANGE INTO ANOTHER ELEMENT BECAUSE THE ATOM LOSES TWO PROTONS AND TWO ELECTRONS. FOR EXAMPLE IF AMERICIUM WERE TO GO THROUGH ALPHA DECAY IT WOULD CHANGE INTO NEPTUNIUM BECAUSE NEPTUNIUM IS DEFINED BY HAVING TWO PROTONS FEWER THAN AMERICIUM. ALPHA DECAY USUALLY HAPPENS IN THE MOST HEAVY ELEMENTS SUCH AS URANIUM THORIUM PLUTONIUM AND RADIUM.
ALPHA PARTICLES CANNOT EVEN GO THROUGH A FEW CENTIMETERS OF AIR. ALPHA RADIATION CANNOT HURT HUMANS WHEN THE ALPHA RADIATION SOURCE IS OUTSIDE THE HUMAN BODY BECAUSE HUMAN SKIN DOES NOT LET THE ALPHA PARTICLES GO THROUGH. ALPHA RADIATION CAN BE VERY HARMFUL IF THE SOURCE IS INSIDE THE BODY SUCH AS WHEN PEOPLE BREATHE DUST OR GAS CONTAINING MATERIALS WHICH DECAY BY EMITTING ALPHA PARTICLES RADIATION.
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF BETA DECAY BETA PLUS AND BETA MINUS.
IN BETA MINUS DECAY THE NUCLEUS GIVES OUT A NEGATIVELY CHARGED ELECTRON AND A NEUTRON CHANGES INTO A PROTON 
BETA MINUS DECAY HAPPENS IN NUCLEAR REACTORS.
IN BETA PLUS DECAY THE NUCLEUS RELEASES A POSITRON WHICH IS LIKE AN ELECTRON BUT IT IS POSITIVELY CHARGED AND A PROTON CHANGES INTO A NEUTRON 
BETA PLUS DECAY HAPPENS INSIDE THE SUN AND IN SOME TYPES OF PARTICLE ACCELERATORS.
GAMMA DECAY HAPPENS WHEN A NUCLEUS PRODUCES A HIGH ENERGY PACKET OF ENERGY CALLED A GAMMA RAY. GAMMA RAYS DO NOT HAVE ELECTRICAL CHARGE BUT THEY DO HAVE ANGULAR MOMENTUM. GAMMA RAYS ARE USUALLY EMITTED FROM NUCLEI JUST AFTER OTHER TYPES OF DECAY. GAMMA RAYS CAN BE USED TO SEE THROUGH MATERIAL TO KILL BACTERIA IN FOOD TO FIND SOME TYPES OF DISEASE AND TO TREAT SOME KINDS OF CANCER. GAMMA RAYS HAVE THE HIGHEST ENERGY OF ANY ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE AND GAMMA RAY BURSTS FROM SPACE ARE THE MOST ENERGETIC RELEASES OF ENERGY KNOWN EVEN MORE ENERGETIC THAN SUPERNOVAS.
RELIGION
A RELIGION IS A SET OF BELIEFS THAT IS HELD BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT RELIGIONS EACH WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF BELIEFS. THE BELIEFS ARE ABOUT THE WORLD AND THE PEOPLE IN IT ABOUT HOW THEY CAME INTO BEING AND WHAT THEIR PURPOSE IS. THESE BELIEFS ARE OFTEN LINKED TO SUPERNATURAL BEINGS SUCH AS GOD A NUMBER OF GODS OR SPIRITS. THEY MAY ALSO BE LINKED TO AN IDEA SUCH AS A PATH THAT THE SPIRIT OF EACH PERSON SHOULD TAKE TOWARDS GOODNESS TRUTH AND DUTY. THIS IS CALLED SPIRITUALITY. EACH RELIGION HAS DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT THESE THINGS. EACH RELIGION ALSO HAS A MORAL CODE WHICH IS A SET OF BELIEFS ABOUT HOW HUMANS SHOULD ACT. EACH RELIGION USUALLY HAS THEIR OWN TYPE OF DEVOTIONS WHEN PEOPLE WORSHIP OR PRAY. THEY OFTEN HAVE RITUALS SPECIAL THINGS THAT ARE ALWAYS DONE IN THE SAME WAY FOR CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR OR CERTAIN TIMES OF A PERSON S LIFE. OTHER WORDS THAT ARE USED FOR RELIGION ARE FAITH AND BELIEF SYSTEM. ALTOGETHER FOLLOWERS OF RELIGION CAN BE KNOWN AS RELIGIONISTS. SOME PEOPLE FOLLOW MORE THAN ONE RELIGION AT A TIME. 
THE LARGEST RELIGIONS ARE CHRISTIANITY ISLAM HINDUISM BUDDHISM TAOISM SIKHISM AND JUDAISM. THERE ARE MANY OTHER RELIGIONS. PEOPLE WHO DO NOT BELIEVE IN ANY GODS ARE CALLED ATHEISTS. PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT THEY ARE NOT SURE WHETHER THEY BELIEVE OR NOT ARE CALLED AGNOSTICS.
IN MANY RELIGIONS ONE OF THE MAIN BELIEFS IS THAT THERE IS A DEITY OR GOD WHO IS A GREAT CREATOR SPIRIT. IN MANY RELIGIONS THERE IS JUST ONE DEITY THAT THE PEOPLE BELIEVE IN. IN OTHER RELIGIONS THERE ARE MANY DEITIES WHO EACH HAVE DIFFERENT ROLES IN THE UNIVERSE. IN MANY RELIGIONS THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF SPIRITS. THESE MAY INCLUDE ANGELS DEVILS AND OTHER SUCH THINGS WHICH CAN BE BOTH GOOD AND BAD.
GIVING HONOUR TO GOD THE GODS OR THE SPIRITS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF MOST RELIGIONS. WHILE THIS MAY OFTEN BE DONE PRIVATELY IT IS ALSO OFTEN DONE WITH GATHERINGS OF PEOPLE AND RITUALS. THESE RITUALS ARE OFTEN BASED ON OLD TRADITIONS AND MAY HAVE BEEN DONE IN ALMOST THE SAME WAY FOR HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF YEARS.
ANOTHER MAIN BELIEF IS THAT HUMANS HAVE A SOUL OR SPIRIT WHICH LIVES ON AFTER THEIR BODY HAS DIED. THE PERSON S SPIRIT IS ON A JOURNEY THROUGH LIFE THAT CONTINUES AFTER DEATH. MOST RELIGIONS BELIEVE THAT WHAT A PERSON DOES DURING THEIR LIFETIME WILL AFFECT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR SPIRIT IN THE AFTERLIFE. MANY RELIGIONS TEACH THAT A GOOD PERSON S SPIRIT CAN REACH A SPECIAL PLACE OF PEACE AND HAPPINESS SUCH AS HEAVEN OR NIRVANA AND THAT A BAD PERSON S SPIRIT CAN TRAVEL TO A PLACE OF PAIN AND SUFFERING SUCH AS HELL. STILL OTHER RELIGIONS BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION THAT INSTEAD OF GOING EITHER TO HEAVEN OR HELL SPIRITS OF THE DEAD RETURN TO EARTH IN A NEW BODY.
MORALS ARE THE WAY A HUMAN BEHAVES TO OTHER HUMANS. MOST RELIGIONS MAKE RULES ABOUT HUMAN MORALS. THE RULES OF HOW PEOPLE SHOULD ACT TO EACH OTHER ARE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT RELIGIONS.
FOR SOME RELIGIONS FOLLOWING A PATH OF GOODNESS TRUTH AND DUTY IS VERY IMPORTANT. THIS IS CALLED TAO IN CHINA. IN THE TEACHINGS OF JUDAISM PEOPLE WERE TOLD TO LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR AS YOURSELF. IN THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS PEOPLE WERE TOLD TO THINK OF EVERY SINGLE PERSON AS THEIR NEIGHBOUR AND TREAT THEM WITH LOVE.
NOT EVERY RELIGION TEACHES PEOPLE TO BE KIND TO ALL OTHER PEOPLE. IN MANY RELIGIONS IT HAS BEEN COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE TO ACT KINDLY ONLY TO SOME PEOPLE AND NOT TO OTHERS. IN SOME RELIGIONS PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT THEY COULD PLEASE A GOD BY KILLING OR SACRIFICING ANOTHER PERSON.
A RELIGION IS PASSED ON FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER THROUGH TEACHINGS AND STORIES WHICH ARE OFTEN CALLED MYTHS WHICH MAY BE WRITTEN DOWN LIKE THE BIBLE OR TOLD FROM MEMORY LIKE THE DREAMTIME STORIES OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL PEOPLE. IN MANY RELIGIONS THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE ROLE OF PRIEST AND SPEND THEIR LIVES TEACHING OTHERS ABOUT THE RELIGION. THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE ROLE OF PASTOR AND SPEND THEIR LIFE CARING FOR OTHER PEOPLE. A PERSON MAY BE BOTH A PRIEST AND A PASTOR. THEY ARE CALLED BY DIFFERENT NAMES IN DIFFERENT RELIGIONS.
SYMBOLS ARE USED TO REMIND PEOPLE OF THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. THEY ARE ALSO USED OR WORN AS A SIGN TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT THE PERSON BELONGS TO A PARTICULAR RELIGION. A SYMBOL MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT IS DRAWN OR WRITTEN IT MIGHT BE A PIECE OF CLOTHING OR JEWELLERY IT MIGHT BE A SIGN THAT A PERSON MAKES WITH THEIR BODY OR IT MIGHT BE A BUILDING OR MONUMENT OR ARTWORK. PICTURE SYMBOLS FOR DIFFERENT RELIGIONS ARE SHOWN IN THE BOX IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THIS ARTICLE.
IN MANY RELIGIONS IT IS THOUGHT IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD SHOW OTHER PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING A PARTICULAR RELIGION. THIS MIGHT BE DONE IN A GENERAL WAY BY WEARING A SYMBOL OR A TYPE OF CLOTHING. MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR RELIGION SO THAT THEY CAN BELIEVE AS WELL. THIS IS CALLED WITNESSING. 
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO WITNESS. A YOUNG PERSON MIGHT SIMPLY SAY TO THEIR FRIENDS I DO NOT USE DRUGS OR GET DRUNK BECAUSE OF MY RELIGION. THIS IS A WITNESS. A PERSON MAY TELL THEIR CLASSMATES WORKMATES AND FRIENDS ABOUT THEIR BELIEFS. A PERSON MIGHT GO TO OTHER PEOPLE S HOUSES AND TALK ABOUT THEIR BELIEFS OR INVITE THE PEOPLE TO JOIN IN THE RITUALS OF THE RELIGION SUCH AS GOING TO CHURCH OR TO A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL. A PERSON MIGHT HAVE PRINTED MATERIAL SUCH AS BOOKS OR LEAFLETS THAT THEY GIVE TO OTHER PEOPLE TO READ. A PERSON MIGHT TRAVEL TO A DIFFERENT COUNTRY TO TEACH TO WORK IN A HEALTH SERVICE OR TO HELP PEOPLE IN SOME OTHER WAY. PEOPLE WHO DO THIS ARE CALLED MISSIONARIES. THESE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT PEOPLE WITNESS TO THEIR RELIGION.
WHEN A PERSON HEARS A WITNESS AND DECIDES THAT THEY WILL JOIN THE RELIGION THIS IS CALLED A CONVERSION. USUALLY A PERSON DECIDES TO JOIN A RELIGION BECAUSE THEY LIKE WHAT THEY HAVE READ OR BEEN TOLD AND THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE HEARING THE TRUTH. THEY JOIN THE RELIGION BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE. HOWEVER THROUGHOUT HISTORY THERE HAVE BEEN MANY TIMES WHEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO JOIN A RELIGION BY VIOLENCE AND THREATS. THIS IS STILL HAPPENING TODAY.
IN MOST COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD PEOPLE ARE FREE TO BELONG TO WHATEVER RELIGION THEY CHOOSE. THIS IS GENERALLY THOUGHT OF AS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. HOWEVER THERE ARE PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE IT IS ILLEGAL AGAINST THE LAW TO WITNESS TO ANY RELIGION EXCEPT THE ONE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE WHO BELONG TO OTHER RELIGIONS MAY BE THREATENED PUT IN JAIL OR MURDERED.
RITUALS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRADITION OF MANY RELIGIONS. IN MANY RELIGIONS IT IS THE TRADITION FOR PEOPLE TO MEET FOR A CELEBRATION ON ONE DAY IN EVERY WEEK. THERE ARE ALSO MAJOR CELEBRATIONS THAT MAY BE HELD ONLY AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR FOR EXAMPLE ON THE BIRTHDAY OF A PERSON WHO IS HONOURED IN THAT RELIGION. SOME RELIGIONS HAVE CELEBRATIONS FOR DIFFERENT SEASONS OF THE YEAR OR WHEN THE SUN OR MOON IS IN A CERTAIN PART OF THE SKY.
IN NEARLY EVERY RELIGION THE IMPORTANT STAGES OF A PERSON S LIFE HAVE A RELIGIOUS CELEBRATION. BIRTH NAMING REACHING AN AGE TO THINK FOR ONESELF REACHING ADULTHOOD MARRIAGE CHILDBIRTH SICKNESS AND DEATH ARE ALL CELEBRATED BY SOME RELIGIONS. HAVING A CELEBRATION OR SPECIAL TRADITIONS WHEN A PERSON DIES IS VERY COMMON.
IT IS THE TRADITIONS THAT ARE ABOUT DEATH THAT GIVE THE EARLIEST EVIDENCE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT 120 000 YEARS AGO NEANDERTHAL PEOPLE STARTED BURYING THEIR DEAD. EARLY HOMO SAPIENS PUT TOOLS AND OTHER THINGS INTO GRAVES WITH THE BODIES AS IF THEY COULD USE THEM IN THE AFTERLIFE. FROM 40 000 YEARS AGO MANY OF THE OBJECTS IN GRAVES ARE SMALL ARTWORKS. SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE PUT THERE FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS.
AN INSTITUTION IS ONE NAME FOR AN ORGANIZATION. MANY RELIGIONS HAVE ORGANIZATIONS THAT MANAGE THE WAY THAT PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW THE RELIGION ARE TO ACT. THE ORGANIZATION MIGHT EMPLOY RELIGIOUS LEADERS EDUCATE PEOPLE INTO THE IDEAS OF THE RELIGION MANAGE MONEY OWN BUILDINGS AND MAKE RULES. MANY RELIGIONS HAVE SUB GROUPS WHICH ARE CALLED DENOMINATIONS. IN ISLAM FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS AHMADIYYA SUNNISM SHI ISM AND SUFISM.
MOST RELIGIONS HAVE SPECIAL BUILDINGS WHERE PEOPLE MEET. THEY ARE OFTEN CALLED TEMPLES. IN JUDAISM THEY ARE CALLED SYNAGOGUES. IN CHRISTIANITY THEY ARE CALLED CHURCHES. IN ISLAM THEY ARE CALLED MOSQUES. IN BUDDHISM THERE ARE PAGODAS TEMPLES AND MONASTERIES. PEOPLE OFTEN TRY TO MAKE THEIR RELIGIOUS BUILDING AS BEAUTIFUL AS POSSIBLE. SOME RELIGIOUS BUILDINGS ARE GREAT WORKS OF ARCHITECTURE.
PEOPLE OFTEN MAKE ARTWORKS THAT ARE ABOUT THEIR RELIGION OR THAT ARE USED IN RELIGIOUS CELEBRATION OR ARE PUT IN A RELIGIOUS BUILDING. RELIGIOUS ART COMES IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES FROM TINY PIECES OF JEWELLERY TO HUGE STATUES AND PAINTINGS. ARTWORKS OFTEN GIVE IMPORTANT CLUES TO HISTORIANS ABOUT DIFFERENT ANCIENT RELIGIONS THAT ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD.
MUSIC IS OFTEN IMPORTANT IN RELIGIOUS CELEBRATIONS. SINGING CHANTING AND PLAYING MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS ARE OFTEN PART OF REGULAR RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS OF PEOPLE. SPECIAL MUSIC IS OFTEN USED ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS. MANY FAMOUS COMPOSERS HAVE WRITTEN RELIGIOUS MUSIC. THE WORDS OF SONGS THAT ARE 3 000 YEARS OLD ARE USED EVERY DAY IN CHRISTIAN CHURCHES AND JEWISH SYNAGOGUES.
RENAISSANCE
THE RENAISSANCE IS A PERIOD IN THE HISTORY OF EUROPE BEGINNING IN ABOUT 1400 AND FOLLOWING THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD.
RENAISSANCE IS A FRENCH WORD MEANING REBIRTH. THE PERIOD IS CALLED BY THIS NAME BECAUSE AT THAT TIME PEOPLE STARTED TAKING AN INTEREST IN THE LEARNING OF ANCIENT TIMES IN PARTICULAR THE LEARNING OF ANCIENT GREECE AND ROME. THE RENAISSANCE WAS SEEN AS A REBIRTH OF THAT LEARNING. THE RENAISSANCE IS OFTEN SAID TO BE THE START OF THE MODERN AGE.
DURING THE RENAISSANCE THERE WERE MANY FAMOUS ARTISTS MANY WRITERS AND MANY PHILOSOPHERS. MANY PEOPLE STUDIED MATHEMATICS AND DIFFERENT SCIENCES. A PERSON WHO IS CLEVER AT A GREAT NUMBER OF THINGS IS SOMETIMES CALLED A RENAISSANCE MAN. LEONARDO DA VINCI WHO WAS A PAINTER A SCIENTIST A MUSICIAN AND A PHILOSOPHER IS THE MOST FAMOUS RENAISSANCE MAN.
THE RENAISSANCE STARTED IN ITALY BUT SOON SPREAD ACROSS THE WHOLE OF EUROPE. IN ITALY THE TIME IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PERIODS 
FOLLOWING THE MANNERIST PERIOD WAS THE BAROQUE PERIOD WHICH ALSO SPREAD ACROSS EUROPE FROM ABOUT 1600. OUTSIDE ITALY IT CAN BE HARD TO TELL WHERE THE RENAISSANCE PERIOD ENDS AND BAROQUE BEGINS.
IN THE MIDDLE AGES THERE WERE VERY FEW BOOKS. THE BOOKS THAT EXISTED NEARLY ALL BELONGED TO CHURCHES OR UNIVERSITIES OR TO THE UPPER CLASS. THEY WERE WRITTEN BY HAND. MANY WERE BEAUTIFUL ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS WITH HAND PAINTED PICTURES. THEY WERE SO EXPENSIVE THAT MOST PEOPLE COULD NOT AFFORD THEM.
MOST BOOKS AT THAT TIME WERE WRITTEN IN LATIN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ANCIENT ROMANS THAT WAS USED IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND ONLY UNDERSTOOD BY PRIESTS AND WELL EDUCATED PEOPLE. PEOPLE WERE FORBIDDEN BY LAW FROM TRANSLATING THE BIBLE INTO ITALIAN ENGLISH GERMAN FRENCH OR OTHER LOCAL LANGUAGES.
AROUND 1440 THE FIRST PRINTED BOOKS WERE MADE IN EUROPE. THE WAY OF PRINTING QUICKLY IMPROVED SO THAT LARGE BOOKS LIKE THE BIBLE COULD BE MADE AND SOLD CHEAPLY. IT TOOK 300 CALF SKINS OR 100 PIG SKINS TO PRINT THE BIBLE. THE PRINTERS THEN BEGAN TO PRINT EVERYTHING THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING ANCIENT GREEK AND ROMAN WRITINGS POETRY PLAYS LIVES OF THE SAINTS MATHEMATICS TEXTBOOKS MEDICAL TEXTBOOKS CHRISTIAN STORIES EROTIC STORIES BOOKS ABOUT ANIMALS AND MONSTERS ADVICE TO PRINCES AS TO HOW TO RULE THEIR PEOPLE AND MAPS OF THE WORLD.
BEFORE THE INVENTION OF THE PRINTING PRESS KNOWLEDGE BELONGED TO PRIESTS MONASTERIES AND UNIVERSITIES. SUDDENLY MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EVEN MERCHANTS COULD LEARN FAR MORE THAN THEY EVER COULD BEFORE. 
THE TIME OF ANCIENT GREECE AND ROME WHEN THERE WERE MANY PHILOSOPHERS WRITERS PAINTERS SCULPTORS ARCHITECTS AND MATHEMATICIANS WAS SEEN BY PEOPLE AS A GOLDEN AGE A TIME WHEN THINGS WERE BEAUTIFUL WELL ORGANISED AND WELL RUN. THIS TIME HAD LASTED FROM ABOUT 400 BC TO ABOUT 400 AD.
IN THE YEAR 1400 IN THE CITY OF ROME PEOPLE WOULD WANDER AROUND LOOKING UP AT THE RUINS OF A CITY THAT HAD ONCE BEEN GREAT. INSIDE THE BROKEN WALLS THAT HAD BEEN SMASHED IN 410 AD WERE THE REMAINS OF HUGE TEMPLES SPORTS ARENAS PUBLIC BATHS APARTMENT BLOCKS AND PALACES. NEARLY ALL OF THEM WERE RUINED AND COULD NOT BE USED. NEARLY ALL OF THEM WERE HALF BURIED IN DIRT. A LOT OF THEM WERE PULLED DOWN TO USE AS BUILDING STONE. BUT THEY SHOWED PEOPLE WHAT GREAT THINGS COULD BE DONE. AMONG THE RUINS OF THIS ONCE GREAT CITY THE PEOPLE OF ROME LIVED IN COTTAGES. THEY STILL WENT TO CHURCH IN THE HUGE CHURCHES BASILICAS BUILT BY THE FIRST CHRISTIAN EMPEROR CONSTANTINE THE GREAT IN THE 4TH CENTURY. THEY STILL HELD MARKET DAY IN THE ANCIENT ROMAN MARKET PLACE OF CAMPO DEI FIORI FIELD OF FLOWERS.
ONE DAY IN 1402 INTO THE MIDDLE OF ROME CAME A YOUNG MAN CALLED FILIPPO BRUNELLESCHI AND A TEENAGE BOY CALLED DONATELLO. THEY WERE FASCINATED BY EVERYTHING THAT THEY SAW. THEY MEASURED ANCIENT RUINED BUILDINGS THEY DREW THINGS AND THEY DUG AROUND FOR WEEKS LOOKING FOR BITS OF BROKEN STATUES AND PAINTED POTTERY THAT THEY COULD STICK TOGETHER. THEY WERE PROBABLY THE WORLD S FIRST ARCHAEOLOGISTS. BY THE TIME THEY WENT BACK HOME TO FLORENCE THEY KNEW MORE ABOUT ANCIENT ROMAN ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE THAN ANYONE HAD KNOWN FOR ABOUT A THOUSAND YEARS. BRUNELLESCHI BECAME A VERY FAMOUS ARCHITECT AND DONATELLO BECAME A VERY FAMOUS SCULPTOR.
THE CITY OF FLORENCE IS REALLY WHERE THE RENAISSANCE BEGAN. IN THOSE DAYS ITALY WAS NOT ONE SINGLE COUNTRY. IT WAS LOTS OF LITTLE STATES ALL GOVERNED IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND ALL FIGHTING OR MAKING ALLIES WITH EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.
ROME WAS POLITICALLY POWERFUL BECAUSE ROME HAD THE POPE THE PERSON IN CONTROL OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. BECAUSE OF HIS VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE AS A SPIRITUAL LEADER MOST PEOPLE AND MOST CITIES DID NOT WANT TO ARGUE WITH THE POPE WHICHEVER POPE HE MIGHT BE. BECAUSE A NEW POPE WAS ELECTED WHEN THE OLD ONE DIED EVERYONE WHO WAS RICH AND POWERFUL WAS ALWAYS HOPING IT MIGHT BE A MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY. IT WAS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE SEVERAL YOUNG MEN IN THE FAMILY TRAINED AS PRIESTS JUST IN CASE. IT WAS ALSO A GOOD IDEA TO BE GOOD FRIENDS WITH OTHER RICH FAMILIES. ONE WAY TO DO THIS WAS TO HAVE LOTS OF DAUGHTERS AND GET THEM TO MARRY RICH POWERFUL MEN FROM DIFFERENT CITIES. THIS WAS THE WAY THAT POLITICS WORKED.
OTHER CITIES THAT WERE POWERFUL WERE VENICE WITH ITS GREAT BIG NAVY MILAN WHICH CONTROLLED TRADE WITH NORTHERN EUROPE AND WAS VERY RICH GENOA WHICH CONTROLLED TRADE WITH FRANCE AND SPAIN AND WAS VERY RICH AND FLORENCE WHERE MANY PEOPLE SAY THE RENAISSANCE STARTED.
THE POWER OF FLORENCE WAS NOT FOUNDED ON A STRONG ARMY ON A STRONG FORTRESS OR A GOOD POSITION TO CONTROL TRADE. IT WAS FOUNDED ON BANKING. THE CLEVERNESS IN BUSINESS OF ONE SINGLE FAMILY WAS VERY IMPORTANT IN MAKING FLORENCE POWERFUL AND THE CENTRE OF RENAISSANCE LEARNING. THE FAMILY WERE CALLED THE MEDICI.
RHETORIC
RHETORIC IS THE ART OF CONVINCING AND PERSUADING PEOPLE BY LANGUAGE THROUGH PUBLIC SPEAKING OR WRITING. THE ROOT OF THE WORD IS FROM GREEK ROUGHLY MEANING THE ART OF SPEECH. 
WEBSTER S DICTIONARY DEFINES IT AS THE ART OR SCIENCE OF USING WORDS EFFECTIVELY IN SPEAKING OR WRITING ESPECIALLY THE ART OR SCIENCE OF LITERARY COMPOSITION. 
THE WORD EFFECTIVELY IN THIS DEFINITION IS A RELATIVE MATTER. WHAT IS EFFECTIVE IN ONE CONTEXT MAY BE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT IN ANOTHER CULTURAL SETTING. DIFFERENT LANGUAGES DIFFER IN THEIR RHETORICAL STYLES THAT IS IN THE WAY THAT THEY USE LANGUAGE TO ACCOMPLISH VARIOUS PURPOSES. PEOPLE CAN BE TRAINED IN THIS SKILL. IT IS THE ART OR THE TECHNIQUE OF PERSUASION USED BY ORATORS PUBLIC SPEAKERS WRITERS AND MEDIA.
ITS ORIGIN WAS IN ANCIENT GREECE OF THE 5TH CENTURY. THEY MADE THEIR DECISIONS BY SPEAKING FOR OR AGAINST PROPOSALS IN A PUBLIC PLACE. ALSO SPEECHES WERE MADE WHEN A PERSON WAS ACCUSED OF A SERIOUS CRIME BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES. BECAUSE RHETORIC WAS SO IMPORTANT TO THEM THE GREEKS AND ROMANS WROTE ABOUT HOW TO BE A GOOD RHETORICIAN. THIS IS SOMETIMES CALLED SECONDARY RHETORIC. IT IS A TECHNIQUE WHICH CAN BE TAUGHT AND USED IN WRITING. AN EARLY EXAMPLE IS PLATO WHO WROTE HIS WORKS IN THE FORM OF DIALOGUES. EACH QUESTION RAISED IS DISCUSSED BETWEEN TWO CHARACTERS. IN THE ANCIENT WORLD THE ROMANS WHO WERE MUCH INFLUENCED BY THE ANCIENT GREEKS ALSO USED THE SAME METHODS FOR DECISION MAKING. CICERO WAS ONE OF THEIR FAMOUS ORATORS. IN THEIR CASE THE DEBATES DID NOT INVOLVE ALL CITIZENS JUST THE ROMAN SENATE OR THE COURTS. 
IN MEDIEVAL UNIVERSITIES RHETORIC WAS TAUGHT AS PART OF THE CURRICULUM. RHETORIC DIALECTIC AND GRAMMAR FORM THE TRIVIUM WHICH WITH THE QUADRIVIUM MAKE UP THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS OF WESTERN CULTURE. DURING ANTIQUITY AND THE MIDDLE AGES RHETORIC WAS USED FOR PERSUASION IN PUBLIC AND POLITICAL ARENAS AND ALSO IN THE COURTS OF JUSTICE. THE WORDS RHETORIC OR SOPHISM ARE OFTEN USED WITH A NEGATIVE MEANING OF DISINFORMATION OR PROPAGANDA. AS THE ART OF PERSUASION THE RHETORIC CONTINUES TO BE IMPORTANT IN PRESENT DAY PUBLIC LIFE. THEY ARE ALSO USED TO DESCRIBE A SPEECH WITH DOUBTFUL OR SLANTED ARGUMENTS. SEVERAL HUNDRED RHETORICAL FIGURES WERE RECOGNISED BY CLASSICAL RHETORICIANS. SOME OF THESE ARE STILL IN USE SUCH AS METAPHOR SIMILE AND PARADOX.
IN THE MODERN WORLD SPEECHES MADE ON TELEVISION IDEAS EMBEDDED IN ADVERTISEMENTS OR IN FRONT OF CROWDS ARE ALL RHETORICS. THEY SPEAK TO PEOPLE DIRECTLY WITH THE INTENTION OF PERSUADING THEM. BEFORE WORLD WAR II RADIO AND PRINT MEDIA WERE POWERFUL TOOLS FOR RHETORIC. THE NEWSPAPERS AND BOOKS PERSUADE READERS TOWARDS A PARTICULAR POINT OF VIEW. RHETORIC DOES NOT DEPEND ONLY ON A LIVE AUDIENCE.
ACCORDING TO ARISTOTLE A RHETORIC HAS THREE ELEMENTS IN PERSUASION 
A 1988 STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BY S TER IN AUSTRALIA AMONG STUDENTS WHO WERE NATIVE SPEAKERS OF ARABIC VIETNAMESE AND ENGLISH. THE SAMPLE 6TH AND 11TH GRADE STUDENTS WERE ASKED TO WRITE A BEDTIME STORY FOR A YOUNG CHILD. PATTERNS WERE IMMEDIATELY EVIDENT IN THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES USED BY THE STUDENT S IN THE STORY WRITING TASK. 
THE VIETNAMESE STORIES PLACED PRIMARY FOCUS ON CHARACTERS AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM MANIFESTED IN A GREAT PROPORTION OF DIALOG. ENGLISH STORIES PLACED PRIMARY FOCUS ON THE SEQUENTIAL FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE PLOT. ARABIC STORIES PLACED PRIMARY FOCUS ON DESCRIPTIVE ELEMENTS OF THE SETTING. 
CONTRASTIVE RHETORICS SAYS THAT PEOPLE WHO SHARE A COMMON LANGUAGE MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT RHETORIC STYLES DUE THE INFLUENCE OF CULTURE AND EXCHANGES. THE DISCOURSE GOES BEYOND THE TARGET LANGUAGE S NATIVE FORMS OF DISCOURSE ORGANIZATION OR RHETORIC. 
A PARAPHRASING TASK STUDY WAS DONE IN THE USA AMONG CHINESE AND RUSSIAN STUDENTS. AMERICAN STUDENTS WERE EASILY ABLE TO PARAPHRASE BUT CHINESE STUDENTS FOUND IT HARD PERHAPS DUE TO THEIR ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT INFLUENCED BY CONFUCIAN TRADITIONS. RUSSIAN STUDENTS STRUGGLED WITH THE PARAPHRASING BECAUSE NORM IN RUSSIAN ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT WAS THAT STUDENTS ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO READ AND DESCRIBE AND WAS NOT REQUIRED TO GIVE A PERSONAL INTERPRETATION OR AN OPINION.
U.S. RHETORICAL STYLE ETHNOCENTRIC SOURCES DESCRIBE IT AS TYPICALLY DIRECT AND RELATIVELY LOGICAL.
SOME VERY WITTY THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID AGAINST ORATORS AND THEIR RHETORIC 
RIVER
A RIVER IS A STREAM OF WATER THAT FLOWS THROUGH A CHANNEL OR PASSAGE IN THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND. THE PASSAGE WHERE THE RIVER FLOWS IS CALLED THE RIVER BED AND THE EARTH ON EACH SIDE IS CALLED A RIVER BANK. A RIVER BEGINS ON HIGH GROUND OR IN HILLS OR MOUNTAINS AND FLOWS DOWN FROM THE HIGH GROUND TO THE LOWER GROUND BECAUSE OF GRAVITY. A RIVER BEGINS AS A SMALL STREAM AND GETS BIGGER THE FARTHER IT FLOWS.
THE WATER IN A RIVER IS CALLED FRESH WATER. IT COMES FROM RAIN OR SNOW AND IT CAN USUALLY BE DRUNK SAFELY UNLESS IT HAS BEEN POLLUTED. THE WATER IN A SEA CANNOT BE DRUNK SAFELY BECAUSE IT IS SALT WATER. BOTH PEOPLE AND ANIMALS OFTEN LIVE NEAR RIVERS. THEY NEED WATER TO SURVIVE AND FOR HUMANS RIVERS WERE ONCE THE ONLY MEANS OF FAST TRANSPORT.
THE START OF A RIVER IS CALLED THE SOURCE OR HEAD WATER. THE PART OF THE RIVER THAT IS NEAR THE SOURCE IS CALLED A YOUNG RIVER. A YOUNG RIVER IS OFTEN IN A V SHAPED RIVER BED AND FLOWS QUICKLY DOWNHILL OVER STONES AND AROUND BIG ROCKS. YOUNG RIVERS OFTEN HAVE LOTS OF SMALL WATERFALLS AND RAPIDS. 
THE MIDDLE PART OF A RIVER IS CALLED A MATURE RIVER. A MATURE RIVER MAKES A RIVERBED THAT IS U SHAPED. IT MIGHT BE VERY DEEP AND RUN FAST. IT SWEEPS OVER SMALL ROCKS AND BOULDERS AND MAKES BIG TURNS AROUND HILLS AND MOUNTAINS. IT IS MUCH WIDER THAN A YOUNG RIVER BUT NOT AS WIDE AS AN OLD RIVER. TO CROSS OVER A MATURE RIVER PEOPLE USE BRIDGES. MANY CITIES AND TOWNS ARE BUILT ON THE BANKS OF MATURE RIVERS. MANY FARMS THAT KEEP ANIMALS SUCH AS DAIRY COWS HORSES AND SHEEP ARE ALONG MATURE RIVERS BECAUSE THE ANIMALS CAN DRINK FROM THE RIVER EVERY DAY. 
A RIVER USUALLY ENDS BY FLOWING INTO AN OCEAN A LAKE OR A BIGGER RIVER. THE PLACE WHERE THE RIVER FLOWS OUT INTO A BIGGER BODY OF WATER IS CALLED THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER. 
AS A RIVER FLOWS TOWARDS ITS MOUTH THE COUNTRYSIDE AROUND THE RIVER OFTEN CHANGES FROM HILLY TO FLAT. AS IT FLOWS OVER THE FLAT LAND THE RIVER BECOMES WIDER AND SLOWER. A WIDE SLOW RIVER IS CALLED AN OLD RIVER. AN OLD RIVER OFTEN FLOODS ACROSS THE LAND AFTER THERE IS LOTS OF RAIN AT THE HEADWATERS. AN OLD RIVER SLOWLY BUILDS UP ITS BANKS ON EITHER SIDE THE HIGH BANKS ARE CALLED LEVEES. AN OLD RIVER OFTEN MEANDERS TWISTS AND TURNS AND SOMETIMES AFTER A FLOOD IT LEAVES LAKES BEHIND WHICH ARE CALLED OX BOWS OR BILLABONGS. OLD RIVERS ARE THE MOST USEFUL TYPE OF RIVER FOR GROWING CROPS. CORN RICE FRUIT COTTON HAY TOBACCO AND SUGAR ARE SOME OF THE CROPS THAT ARE GROWN NEAR OLD RIVERS. 
THE SHAPE OF THE MOUTH DEPENDS ON THE CONDITIONS OF THE SEA WHERE IT FLOWS. IF THERE IS A STRONG TIDE WHERE THE RIVER MEETS THE SEA THE RIVER FORMS AN ESTUARY. AN ESTUARY IS A WIDE FUNNEL LIKE MOUTH OF THE RIVER. THE FRESH WATER OF THE RIVER MIXES SLOWLY WITH THE SALT WATER BECOMING BRACKISH WATER SOMEWHAT SALTY WATER. MANY KINDS OF FISH CLAMS MOLLUSCS AND OTHER SEALIFE LIVE AT ESTUARIES. MANY OF THE WORLD S LARGEST CITIES AND HARBOURS ARE AT ESTUARIES.
WHERE A RIVER FLOWS OUT TO THE SEA IT SOMETIMES FLOWS VERY SLOWLY THROUGH SANDY OR MUDDY LAND MAKING LOTS OF LITTLE ISLANDS AS IT FLOWS. THE MAIN STREAM OF THE RIVER GETS BROKEN INTO MANY PARTS THAT SPREAD OUT INTO A TRIANGLE SHAPE LIKE THE GREEK LETTER DELTA. WHEN THIS HAPPENS IT IS CALLED THE DELTA OF THE RIVER. DELTAS ARE OFTEN PLACES THAT ARE NOT GOOD FOR TOWNS OR FARMS BUT ARE VERY GOOD FOR BIRDS AND OTHER WILDLIFE AND FISHING. DELTAS ARE OFTEN MADE INTO WILDLIFE RESERVES. NOT ALL RIVERS HAVE DELTAS. THERE ARE FAMOUS DELTAS ON THE NILE RIVER THE AMAZON RIVER THE MEKONG RIVER THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND THE DANUBE RIVER.

SOME RIVERS FLOW UNDERGROUND THROUGH CAVES. UNDERGROUND RIVERS FORM IN PLACES WHERE THERE ARE LOTS OF CRACKS IN THE ROCKS ABOVE SO THAT IN RAINY WEATHER THE WATER RUNS DOWNS AND COLLECTS IN SMALL UNDERGROUND STREAMS. SOMETIMES THE UNDERGROUND WATER TRICKLES OR GUSHES OUT OF THE GROUND TO FORM A SMALL SPRING OF WATER. IN OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE ARE CAVES THE SMALL UNDERGROUND STREAMS RUN TOGETHER TO FORM A RIVER. THE RIVER CAN SOMETIMES RUN THROUGH DEEP WIDE UNDERGROUND CAVERNS. WHILE MANY UNDERGROUND RIVERS FLOW GENTLY SOME UNDERGROUND RIVERS FLOW FAST AND HAVE RAPIDS PARTICULARLY AFTER HEAVY RAIN. MANY UNDERGROUND RIVERS FLOW OUT THROUGH A CAVE MOUTH TO BECOME AN ORDINARY RIVER.
THE WATER IN RIVERS IS FRESH WATER THAT HAS COME FROM RAIN SNOW AND FROM UNDERGROUND STREAMS. IT CAN USUALLY BE DRUNK SAFELY BY PEOPLE UNLESS IT IS TOO DIRTY BECAUSE OF MUD OR HUMAN POLLUTION. PEOPLE AND ANIMALS NEED FRESH WATER TO DRINK SO THEY OFTEN LIVE BY THE SIDE OF A RIVER. 
ROBOT
A ROBOT IS AN ARTIFICIAL AGENT MEANING IT ACTS INSTEAD OF A PERSON DOING THINGS IT IS DESIGNED FOR.
ROBOTS ARE USUALLY MACHINES CONTROLLED BY A COMPUTER PROGRAM OR ELECTRONIC CIRCUITRY. THEY MAY BE DIRECTLY CONTROLLED BY HUMANS. THEY MAY BE DESIGNED TO LOOK LIKE HUMANS IN WHICH CASE THEIR BEHAVIOUR MAY SUGGEST INTELLIGENCE OR THOUGHT. MOST ROBOTS DO A SPECIFIC JOB AND THEY DO NOT ALWAYS LOOK LIKE HUMANS. THEY CAN COME IN MANY FORMS.
IN FICTION HOWEVER ROBOTS USUALLY LOOK LIKE PEOPLE AND SEEM TO HAVE A LIFE OF THEIR OWN. THERE ARE MANY BOOKS MOVIES AND VIDEO GAMES WITH ROBOTS IN THEM. ISAAC ASIMOV S I ROBOT IS PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS.
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN BUILDING MACHINES TO DO WORK FOR US FOR A LONG TIME. BUT IT TAKES TIME AND MONEY TO BUILD JUST ONE MACHINE SO EARLY IDEAS STAYED IDEAS OR WERE BUILT TO MAKE RICH PEOPLE LAUGH.
LEONARDO DA VINCI DESIGNED A MAN SHAPED MACHINE TO LOOK LIKE A KNIGHT IN 1464. IT WOULD BE CONTROLLED WITH ROPES AND WHEELS.
OTHER ENGINEERS AND DREAMERS DREW MECHANICAL MEN. IN1920 KAREL APEK WROTE A STORY ABOUT THEM AND HE USED A WORD FROM CZECH THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WORK ROBOT.
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ROBOT DESIGNS IN THE 20TH CENTURY WERE NOT MADE TO LOOK LIKE PEOPLE. THEY WERE DESIGNED FOR USE. GEORGE DEVOL MADE THE FIRST OF THESE THE UNIMATE IN 1954 WITH ONE ARM AND ONE HAND. GENERAL MOTORS BOUGHT IT IN 1960. THE NEXT YEAR IT STARTED WORK IN A FACTORY IN NEW JERSEY LIFTING AND STACKING PIECES OF METAL THAT WERE TOO HOT FOR PEOPLE TO TOUCH. THE ENGINEERS COULD PROGRAM IT AND REPROGRAM IT IF THEY HAD TO.
ROBOTS HAVE MANY USES. MANY FACTORIES USE ROBOTS TO DO HARD WORK QUICKLY AND WITHOUT MANY MISTAKES. THEY DO NOT LOOK LIKE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE TO DO THINGS. THESE ARE INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS. SOME ROBOTS FIND AND GET RID OF BOMBS. IF SOMEONE MAKES A MISTAKE THE ROBOT IS DAMAGED OR DESTROYED WHICH IS BETTER THAN A PERSON BEING KILLED. THERE ARE ALSO ROBOTS THAT HELP AT HOME TO VACUUM OR RUN A LAWN MOWER FOR EXAMPLE. SUCH ROBOTS MUST LEARN ABOUT THE AREA OF WORK.
A FEW ROBOTS DO SURGERY IN PLACES INSIDE THE BODY WHERE A HUMAN HAND IS TOO BIG. 
PLANET ROVERS ARE ROBOTS FOR EXPLORING DISTANT PLANETS. BECAUSE IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO SEND A RADIO SIGNAL FROM EARTH TO ANOTHER PLANET THE ROBOTS DO MUCH OF THEIR WORK ALONE WITHOUT COMMANDS FROM EARTH. 
PEOPLE STILL THINK OF ROBOTS AS HAVING A SHAPE LIKE A PERSON TWO LEGS TWO ARMS AND A HEAD. ASIMO IS ONE ROBOT THAT IS HELPING SCIENTISTS LEARN HOW TO DESIGN AND PROGRAM ROBOTS. IT CAN WALK WHICH IS NOT EASY TO PROGRAM.
ROUGHLY HALF OF ALL THE ROBOTS IN THE WORLD ARE IN ASIA 32 IN EUROPE AND 16 IN NORTH AMERICA 1 IN AUSTRALASIA AND 1 IN AFRICA. 30 OF ALL THE ROBOTS IN THE WORLD ARE IN JAPAN. JAPAN HAS THE MOST ROBOTS OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND IS THE LEADER IN THE WORLD ROBOTICS INDUSTRY. JAPAN IS ACTUALLY SAID TO BE THE ROBOTIC CAPITAL OF THE WORLD.
IN JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA IDEAS OF FUTURE ROBOTS HAVE BEEN MAINLY POSITIVE. THE POSITIVE RECEPTION OF ROBOTS THERE MAY BE PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE FAMOUS CARTOON ROBOT ASTROBOY. CHINA EXPRESSED VIEWS ON ROBOTICS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA BUT CHINA IS BEHIND BOTH AMERICA AND EUROPE IN ROBOTIC DEVELOPMENT. THE EAST ASIAN VIEW IS THAT ROBOTS SHOULD BE ROUGHLY EQUAL TO HUMANS. THEY FEEL ROBOTS COULD CARE FOR OLD PEOPLE TEACH CHILDREN OR SERVE AS ASSISTANTS. THE POPULAR OPINION OF EAST ASIA IS THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ROBOTS TO BECOME MORE POPULAR AND MORE ADVANCED. THIS VIEW IS OPPOSITE TO THE POPULAR WESTERN VIEW.
THIS IS THE OPENING OF AN ERA IN WHICH HUMAN BEINGS AND ROBOTS CAN CO EXIST SAYS JAPANESE FIRM MITSUBISHI ABOUT ONE OF THE MANY HUMAN LIKE ROBOTS IN JAPAN. THE SOUTH KOREAN MINISTRY OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION HAS PREDICTED THAT EVERY SOUTH KOREAN HOUSEHOLD WILL HAVE A ROBOT BY BETWEEN 2015 AND 2020.
WESTERN SOCIETIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE AGAINST OR EVEN FEAR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROBOTS. SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES AND OTHER STORIES OFTEN SHOW THEM AS DANGEROUS REBELS AGAINST HUMANITY.
THE WEST REGARDS ROBOTS AS A THREAT TO THE FUTURE OF HUMANS WHICH IS MUCH DUE TO RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE OF THE ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS IN WHICH CREATING MACHINES THAT CAN THINK FOR THEMSELVES WOULD ALMOST BE PLAYING GOD. OBVIOUSLY THESE BOUNDARIES ARE NOT CLEAR BUT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IDEOLOGIES.
THE WRITER ISAAC ASIMOV TOLD MANY STORIES ABOUT ROBOTS WHO HAD THE THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS TO KEEP HUMANS SAFE FROM THEM.
THESE WERE NOT USED IN REAL LIFE WHEN HE INVENTED THEM. HOWEVER IN TODAY S WORLD ROBOTS ARE MORE COMPLICATED AND ONE DAY REAL LAWS MAY BE NEEDED MUCH LIKE ISAAC ASIMOV S ORIGINAL THREE LAWS.
THESE LAWS ARE TALKED ABOUT IN THE MEGAMAN VIDEO GAMES.
SOUTH KOREA WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO HAVE LAWS ABOUT ROBOTS.
ROOT
THE ROOTS OF A PLANT IS THE PART THAT IS USUALLY BURIED IN THE SOIL. ROOTS ARE USUALLY ALWAYS UNDER THE SOIL THOUGH SOMETIMES ROOTS CAN BE ABOVE THE GROUND. THIS IS CALLED AN AERIAL ROOT. 
ALSO STEMS CAN SOMETIMES BE UNDER THE SOIL POTATOES FOR EXAMPLE. ROOTS DO NOT HAVE LEAVES AND ARE DIFFERENT FROM STEMS INSIDE.
PLANTS NEED THEIR ROOTS ESPECIALLY FOR THREE REASONS THE ROOTS TAKE WATER AND NUTRIENTS A SORT OF FOOD FROM THE SOIL. THEY ALSO OFTEN STORE THIS FOOD. AND THEY FIX THE PLANTS TO THE GROUND. 
HOWEVER MOST PLANT ROOTS DO NOT WORK AT THEIR BEST UNLESS THEY HAVE HELP FROM FUNGI. THE SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN ROOTS AND FUNGUS IS KNOWN AS MYCORRHIZA.
THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF ROOT SYSTEMS 
SOME ROOTS GO VERY DEEP INTO THE GROUND. ONE ROOT THAT WAS FOUND IN ARIZONA USA WAS 60 M BELOW THE SURFACE.
ROOTS ARE ALSO VERY STRONG. SOME TREE ROOTS CAN DESTROY STONES. ROOTS ARE NOT GREEN BECAUSE THE CELLS HAVE NO CHLOROPHYLL.
ROOTS GROW THROUGH THE WHOLE LIFE OF THE PLANT. THEY GROW LONGER FROM THE TIP ADDING CELLS TO THE END OF EACH ROOT. THE ROOT ADDS CELLS TO THEIR TIPS AND THEY GROW FATTER AS THEY ADD CELLS AROUND THEIR TUBE LIKE BODIES.
AT THE TIP OF EACH ROOT THERE IS A SMALL GROUP OF TOUGH DEAD HARD CELLS CALLED THE ROOT CAP. THE ROOT CAP IS THE STRONGEST PART OF THE ROOT TIP AND ITS JOB IS TO PUSH ITS WAY THROUGH THE DIRT TO LOOK FOR MOISTURE AND NUTRIENTS AND PROTECT THE PLANT.
ROOTS ARE USUALLY FOUND UNDERGROUND BUT IN SOME CASES THIS IS NOT SO. IN THE RAINFOREST THE AIR IS WARM AND HUMID IT HAS A LOT OF WATER. SOME RAINFOREST PLANTS KNOWN AS EPIPHYTES GROW RIGHT ON TREES. THEIR ROOTS HANG DOWN IN THE AIR OR RUNNING INTO THE MOSS GROWING ON THE TREES. MANY AERIAL ROOTS ARE USED TO RECEIVE WATER AND NUTRIENT INTAKE DIRECTLY FROM THE AIR FROM FOG DEW OR HUMID AIR.
SOME TREES HAVE ROOTS THAT ARE ABOVE THE GROUND AND UNDERGROUND. MANGROVE TREES HAVE AERIAL ROOTS ROOTS WHICH COME UP INTO THE AIR. THEY EXCHANGE GASES WITH THE ATMOSPHERE JUST AS LEAVES DO. THEY ARE AN ADAPTATION TO THE POOR LEVEL OF OXYGEN IN THE WATERLOGGED SOIL OF THE MANGROVE SWAMP.
THE BANYAN TREE HAS A ROOT SYSTEM THAT IS UNDERGROUND BUT IT ALSO HAS ROOTS THAT START IN ITS BRANCHES AND GROW DOWN TOWARDS THE GROUND. THESE ROOTS NOT ONLY TAKE IN WATER AND NUTRIENTS FROM THE SOIL BUT THEY ALSO HELP TO SUPPORT THE LONG BRANCHES OF THE BANYAN TREE. BECAUSE OF THIS EXTRA SUPPORT BANYAN TREE BRANCHES CAN BE REALLY LONG. A BANYANTREE IN LAHAINA MAUI WHICH WAS PLANTED IN 1873 BY A MAN NAMED WILLIAM OWEN SMITH HAS BRANCHES THAT ARE SO LONG THAT THIS SINGLE TREE COVERS A FULL SQUARE BLOCK IN THE CITY.
MUCH ABOUT AERIAL ROOTS IS STILL UNKNOWN.
THERE ARE TWO MAIN KINDS OF ROOTS SYSTEMS TAPROOT SYSTEMS AND FIBROUS ROOT SYSTEMS. A TAPROOT SYSTEM HAS ONE THICK MAIN ROOT GROWING DOWN FROM THE PLANT S STEM AND LOTS OF SMALLER SECONDARY ROOTS BRANCHING OFF FROM THIS. A TAPROOT SYSTEM IS USUALLY DEEPER THAN IT IS WIDE. OFTEN WE EAT TAPROOTS LIKE CARROTS AND TURNIPS.
A FIBROUS ROOT SYSTEM HAS LOTS OF ROOTS GROWING IN MANY DIRECTIONS. THERE IS NOT ONE MAIN ROOT. A FIBROUS ROOT SYSTEM IS USUALLY WIDER THAN DEEP.
IT HAS BEEN USUALLY ASSUMED THAT IN REGULAR NON AERIAL TERRESTRIAL ROOTS THE NUTRIENTS ARE PUMPED IN TOGETHER WITH THE WATER AND THAT WATER IS PUMPED INTO THE ROOTS BY OSMOSIS. RECENT STUDIES IN LARGE TREES SUCH AS THE GIANT SEQUOIA SHOWED THAT MUCH OF THE PUMPING POWER AFTER INITIAL GROWTH IS RECEIVED BY HYDRAULIC SUCTION DUE TO TRANSPIRATION WATER EVAPORATION FROM THE LEAVES IN ADDITION TO THE STRONG CAPILLARY ACTION IN THE PLANT S BRANCHING XYLEM IN THE STEM AND LEAVES.
SCIENCE
SCIENCE IS WHAT WE DO TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE NATURAL WORLD. IT IS THE TOTAL OF PHYSICS CHEMISTRY BIOLOGY GEOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY. SCIENCE MAKES USE OF MATHEMATICS AND IT MAKES OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS. SCIENCE PRODUCES ACCURATE FACTS SCIENTIFIC LAWS AND THEORIES. SCIENCE ALSO REFERS TO THE LARGE AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE THAT HAS BEEN FOUND USING THIS PROCESS.
RESEARCH USES THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH USES HYPOTHESES BASED ON IDEAS OR EARLIER KNOWLEDGE WHICH CAN BE CATEGORIZED THROUGH DIFFERENT TOPICS. THEN THOSE HYPOTHESES ARE TESTED BY EXPERIMENTS. 
PEOPLE WHO STUDY AND RESEARCH SCIENCE AND TRY TO FIND OUT EVERYTHING ABOUT IT ARE CALLED SCIENTISTS. SCIENTISTS STUDY THINGS BY LOOKING AT THEM VERY CAREFULLY BY MEASURING THEM AND BY DOING EXPERIMENTS AND TESTS. SCIENTISTS TRY TO EXPLAIN WHY THINGS ACT THE WAY THEY DO AND PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
TODAY SCIENCE USUALLY REFERS TO A WAY OF PURSUING KNOWLEDGE NOT JUST THE KNOWLEDGE ITSELF. IT IS MAINLY ABOUT THE PHENOMENA OF THE MATERIAL WORLD. IN THE 17TH AND 18TH CENTURIES SCIENTISTS INCREASINGLY SOUGHT TO FORMULATE KNOWLEDGE IN TERMS OF LAWS OF NATURE SUCH AS NEWTON S LAWS OF MOTION. AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE 19TH CENTURY THE WORD SCIENCE BECAME INCREASINGLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD ITSELF AS A WAY TO STUDY THE NATURAL WORLD INCLUDING PHYSICS CHEMISTRY GEOLOGY AND BIOLOGY.
IT WAS IN THE 19TH CENTURY ALSO THAT THE TERM SCIENTIST WAS CREATED BY WILLIAM WHEWELL. HE MEANT IT TO DISTINGUISH THOSE WHO SOUGHT KNOWLEDGE ON NATURE FROM THOSE WHO SOUGHT OTHER TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE.
THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS THE NAME GIVEN TO THE METHODS USED BY SCIENTISTS TO FIND KNOWLEDGE. THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD ARE 
DISCOVERIES IN FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE CAN BE WORLD CHANGING. FOR EXAMPLE 
NOT EVERYONE COMPLETELY AGREES ABOUT HOW SCIENCE WORKS. SOME PHILOSOPHERS AND SCIENTISTS SAY THAT SCIENTIFIC THEORIES ARE ONLY ACCEPTED FOR THE TIME BEING. THEY LAST SO LONG AS THEY ARE THE BEST EXPLANATION. WHEN THEORIES NO LONGER EXPLAIN THE DATA THEY ARE DISCARDED AND REPLACED. OR SOMETIMES SCIENTISTS WILL MAKE A THEORY BETTER RATHER THAN DISCARD IT OR THEY WILL KEEP ON USING THE THEORY HOPING THAT IT WILL BE MADE BETTER EVENTUALLY.
SCIENCE IS A WAY TO GET KNOWLEDGE BY DISCARDING WHAT IS NOT TRUE. 
SCIENTISTS MUST BE VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE EXPLANATIONS THAT FIT WELL WITH WHAT THEY OBSERVE AND MEASURE. THEY COMPETE TO PROVIDE BETTER EXPLANATIONS. AN EXPLANATION MIGHT BE INTERESTING OR PLEASING BUT IF IT DOES NOT AGREE WITH WHAT OTHER SCIENTISTS REALLY SEE AND MEASURE THEY WILL TRY TO FIND A BETTER EXPLANATION.
BEFORE A SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE IS PUBLISHED OTHER SCIENTISTS READ THE ARTICLE AND DECIDE WHETHER THE EXPLANATIONS MAKE SENSE FROM THE DATA. THIS IS CALLED PEER REVIEW. AFTER ARTICLES ARE PUBLISHED OTHER SCIENTISTS WILL ALSO CHECK IF THE SAME EXPERIMENTS OBSERVATIONS OR TESTS PRODUCE THE SAME DATA AGAIN. PEER REVIEW AND REPEATING EXPERIMENTS ARE THE ONLY WAY TO BE SURE THE KNOWLEDGE IS CORRECT. 
SCIENCE MAKES MODELS OF NATURE MODELS OF OUR UNIVERSE AND MEDICINE. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SCIENCES WITH THEIR OWN NAMES. HOWEVER IT IS NOT RIGHT TO SAY SCIENCE SAYS ANY ONE THING. SCIENCE IS A PROCESS NOT JUST THE FACTS AND RULES BELIEVED AT ONE TIME.
SCIENCE FICTION
SCIENCE FICTION OFTEN SHORTENED TO SCI FI OR SF IS A KIND OF WRITING. SCIENCE FICTION STORIES CAN BE NOVELS MOVIES TV SHOWS COMIC BOOKS AND OTHER LITERATURE.
SF IS OFTEN ABOUT THE FUTURE. IT CAN BE ABOUT IMAGINARY NEW SCIENCE AND INVENTIONS SUCH AS SPACESHIPS TIME MACHINES AND ROBOTS. SCIENCE FICTION STORIES ARE OFTEN IN A WORLD THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE REAL WORLD. THEY CAN HAVE SCIENCE AND TOOLS THAT DO NOT EXIST IN REALITY. SCIENCE FICTION STORIES OFTEN TAKE PLACE ON OTHER WORLDS. THERE ARE OFTEN ALIEN CREATURES.
SCIENCE FICTION IS DIFFERENT FROM FANTASY. FANTASY STORIES OFTEN HAVE MAGIC AND OTHER THINGS THAT DO NOT EXIST AND ARE NOT SCIENCE. ISAAC ASIMOV WAS A FAMOUS SCIENCE FICTION WRITER. HE ONCE SAID THAT SCIENCE FICTION IS POSSIBLE BUT FANTASY IS NOT.
WRITERS OFTEN USE SF TO EXPLAIN EVERYDAY QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS BY PUTTING THEM IN THE FUTURE. USUALLY THEY INVENT A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD TO HELP PEOPLE NOTICE IMPORTANT IDEAS.
SCIENCE FICTION CHANGES OVER TIME. SOME AUTHORS WROTE SF BOOKS BEFORE THIS TYPE OF WRITING HAD A NAME. THESE WRITERS AND BOOKS WERE NOT CALLED SCIENCE FICTION WHEN THEY WERE PUBLISHED. BUT THEY ARE OFTEN CALLED SCIENCE FICTION TODAY.
TWO BROAD GENRES OF SCIENCE FICTION ARE HARD SF AND SOFT SF. ALTHOUGH NOT EVERYONE AGREES ON THE EXACT DEFINITIONS OF THESE TWO TYPES THE WAY THEY USE SCIENCE OR THE TYPE OF SCIENCE USED IN THE STORIES IS DIFFERENT.
HARD SCIENCE FICTION OR HARD SF IS SPECIAL BECAUSE IT USES TRUE FACTS AND THEORIES FROM SCIENCES. THESE SCIENCES ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN HARD SF PHYSICS ASTROPHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY. ALSO HARD SF CAN SHOW WORLDS THAT MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY MAY MAKE POSSIBLE. MANY CORRECT PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE COME FROM THE HARD SCIENCE FICTION SUBGENRE. HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN MANY INCORRECT IDEAS ABOUT THE FUTURE TOO. SOME HARD SF WRITERS HAVE ALSO WORKED AS PROFESSIONAL SCIENTISTS. A FEW OF THESE SCIENTIST WRITERS ARE GREGORY BENFORD AND GEOFFREY A. LANDIS WHILE MATHEMATICIAN AUTHORS INCLUDE RUDY RUCKER AND VERNOR VINGE. OTHER NOTEWORTHY HARD SF AUTHORS INCLUDE ARTHUR C. CLARKE HAL CLEMENT ISAAC ASIMOV GREG BEAR STANISLAV LEM LARRY NIVEN ROBERT J. SAWYER STEPHEN BAXTER ALASTAIR REYNOLDS CHARLES SHEFFIELD AND GREG EGAN.
SOFT SCIENCE FICTION STORIES TAKE IDEAS FROM SOCIAL SCIENCES SUCH AS PSYCHOLOGY ECONOMICS POLITICAL SCIENCE SOCIOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY. SOME IMPORTANT WRITERS IN THIS CATEGORY INCLUDE URSULA K. LE GUIN AND PHILIP K. DICK. SOFT SF CAN BE MOSTLY ABOUT CHARACTER AND EMOTION. RAY BRADBURY WON A PRIZE CALLED THE SFWA GRAND MASTER AND WRITES IN THIS STYLE. THE SOVIET UNION PRODUCED SOCIAL SCIENCE FICTION TOO. SOME EXAMPLES ARE STRUGATSKY BROTHERS KIR BULYCHOV AND IVAN YEFREMOV.
SOME SOCIAL SF AND SOFT SF CAN BE TYPES OF SPECULATIVE FICTION FOR EXAMPLE UTOPIAN OR DYSTOPIAN STORIES. GEORGE ORWELL S NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR ALDOUS HUXLEY S BRAVE NEW WORLD AND MARGARET ATWOOD S THE HANDMAID S TALE ARE EXAMPLES. SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT SATIRICAL NOVELS IN FANTASTIC SETTINGS PLACES SUCH AS GULLIVER S TRAVELS BY JONATHAN SWIFT ARE SPECULATIVE FICTION.
WITHIN HARD OR SOFT SF THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OR SUBGENRES OF SCIENCE FICTION. EACH SUBGENRE IS A GROUP OF STORIES THAT USES SIMILAR IDEAS OR STYLES OF WRITING. PUBLISHING COMPANIES AND CRITICS PUT WORKS OF SF INTO DIFFERENT SUBGENRES TO HELP DESCRIBE THE WORK TO HELP READERS CHOOSE WHICH BOOKS TO READ RO MOVIES TO WATCH. ASSIGNING GENRES IS NOT SIMPLE. SOME STORIES CAN BE IN TWO OR MORE GENRES AT THE SAME TIME. OTHER STORIES MAY NOT FIT ANY GENRE.
IN ALTERNATE OR ALTERNATIVE HISTORY STORIES WRITERS IMAGINE HOW THE PAST MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. THESE STORIES MAY USE TIME TRAVEL TO CHANGE THE PAST. SOME SET A STORY IN A UNIVERSE WITH A DIFFERENT HISTORY FROM OUR OWN. THESE ARE SOME IMPORTANT ALTERNATE HISTORY BOOKS 
THE SIDEWISE AWARD IS FOR THE BEST WORKS IN THIS SUBGENRE. THE NAME SIDEWISE IS TAKEN FROM MURRAY LEINSTER S 1934 STORY SIDEWISE IN TIME. HARRY TURTLEDOVE IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS WRITERS IN THE SUBGENRE. HE IS OFTEN CALLED THE MASTER OF ALTERNATE HISTORY.
APOCALYPTIC FICTION IS ABOUT THE END OF CIVILIZATION. THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES THROUGH WAR ON THE BEACH PANDEMIC THE LAST MAN ASTRONOMIC IMPACT WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE ECOLOGICAL DISASTER THE WIND FROM NOWHERE OR MANKIND S SELF DESTRUCTION ORYX AND CRAKE OR SOME OTHER GENERAL DISASTER. APOCALYPTIC SF MAY ALSO BE ABOUT WORLD OR CIVILIZATION AFTER A DISASTER.
CYBERPUNK BEGAN IN THE EARLY 1980S. BRUCE BETHKE USED THIS WORD AS THE TITLE FOR A SHORT STORY IN 1980 BY PUTTING TOGETHER TWO WORDS CYBERNETICS AND PUNK. SOON PEOPLE USED THIS WORD TO DESCRIBE WILLIAM GIBSON S BOOK NEUROMANCER. CYBERPUNK AUTHORS CAN PUT THEIR STORIES IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS. STORIES USUALLY TAKE PLACE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND THE SETTINGS ARE OFTEN DYSTOPIAN CHARACTERIZED BY MISERY. THESE ARE OFTEN SOCIETIES WITH VERY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. A FEW HUGE CORPORATIONS USUALLY CONTROL THE SOCIETY. ANOTHER EARLY CYBERPUNK NOVEL THAT HAS BECOME A CLASSIC IS SNOW CRASH BY NEAL STEPHENSON.
MILITARY SCIENCE FICTION STORIES HAPPEN DURING WARS. THESE WARS CAN BE BETWEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES DIFFERENT PLANETS OR BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES. THE STORIES ARE TOLD BY CHARACTERS WHO ARE SOLDIERS. THEY INCLUDE DETAIL ABOUT MILITARY TECHNOLOGY RULES AND HISTORY. SOME MILITARY SF MAY BE SIMILAR TO REAL HISTORICAL CONFLICTS. HEINLEIN S STARSHIP TROOPERS IS AN EARLY EXAMPLE. ANOTHER IS THE DORSAI NOVELS OF GORDON DICKSON. JOE HALDEMAN S THE FOREVER WAR IS A RESPONSE TO THE WORLD WAR II STYLE STORIES OF EARLIER MILITARY SF AUTHORS. HALDEMAN WAS A SOLDIER IN THE VIETNAM WAR. IMPORTANT MILITARY SF AUTHORS INCLUDE JOHN RINGO DAVID DRAKE DAVID WEBER AND S. M. STIRLING. BAEN BOOKS IS KNOWN FOR CULTIVATING MILITARY SCIENCE FICTION AUTHORS.
SUPERHUMAN STORIES ARE ABOUT HUMANS WHO GET SPECIAL ABILITIES THAT ARE NOT NORMAL. MAYBE THE NEW POWERS COME FROM NATURE. TWO EXAMPLES OF THIS TYPE ARE OLAF STAPLEDON S NOVEL ODD JOHN AND THEODORE STURGEON S MORE THAN HUMAN. SOMETIMES SCIENTISTS GIVE PEOPLE SPECIAL POWERS ON PURPOSE. ONE EXAMPLE IS A.E. VAN VOGT S NOVEL SLAN. FREDERIK POHL S NOVEL MAN PLUS IS ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE FROM THIS CATEGORY. IN THAT BOOK GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS MAKE A MAN INTO A POWERFUL CYBORG PART HUMAN PART MACHINE.
THESE STORIES USUALLY HAVE TWO MAIN POINTS. ONE IS THE FEELING OF LONELINESS AND SEPARATION THAT THESE SUPERHUMAN PEOPLE FEEL. THE OTHER IS SOCIETY S REACTION TO THEM.
SPACE OPERA IS ADVENTURE SCIENCE FICTION IN OUTER SPACE OR ON DISTANT PLANETS. ACTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SCIENCE OR CHARACTERS. THERE IS USUALLY A STRONG HERO AND A VERY BIG CONFLICT. THE ACTION OFTEN MOVES TO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES. EDWARD E. DOC SMITH WAS AN EARLY SPACE OPERA WRITER. FLASH GORDON AND STAR WARS ARE ALSO POPULAR EXAMPLES.
SOME PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT SPACE WESTERN IS A KIND OF SPACE OPERA. IT TAKES IDEAS FROM BOOKS AND MOVIES ABOUT EXPLORING THE AMERICAN OLD WEST AND MOVES THEM TO SPACE IN THE FUTURE. THESE STORIES ARE OFTEN ON FRONTIER COLONY WORLDS COLONIES THAT HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEEN TERRAFORMED AND OR SETTLED SERVING AS STAND INS FOR THE BACKDROP OF LAWLESSNESS AND ECONOMIC EXPANSION THAT WERE PREDOMINANT IN THE AMERICAN WEST. SOME EXAMPLES ARE FIREFLY AND THE MOVIE SERENITY BY JOSS WHEDON. ANIME PROGRAMS LIKE COWBOY BEBOP AND OUTLAW STAR ARE ALSO SPACE WESTERNS. HAN SOLO FROM STAR WARS IS AN IMPORTANT SPACE WESTERN CHARACTER.
THE FIRST IMPORTANT TIME TRAVEL NOVEL WAS MARK TWAIN S A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR S COURT. THE MOST FAMOUS IS H. G. WELLS S 1895 NOVEL THE TIME MACHINE. WELL S BOOK USES A MACHINE THAT ALLOWS AN OPERATOR TO TRAVEL TO AN EXACT TIME. TWAIN S TIME TRAVELER IS STRUCK IN THE HEAD. THE TERM TIME MACHINE WAS INVENTED BY WELLS. NOW IT IS THE NAME FOR ANY VEHICLE THAT CAN TAKE A RIDER TO A ONE DATE. RAY BRADBURY S 1952 SHORT STORY CALLED A SOUND OF THUNDER IS A MORE RECENT AND VERY FAMOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS GENRE. TIME TRAVEL STORIES CAN BE COMPLICATED. THEY HAVE LOGICAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS THE GRANDFATHER PARADOX. TIME TRAVEL IS A POPULAR SUBJECT IN MODERN SCIENCE FICTION IN PRINT MOVIES AND TELEVISION.
SCIENCE FICTION FANDOM IS THE COMMUNITY OF THE LITERATURE OF IDEAS... THE CULTURE IN WHICH NEW IDEAS EMERGE AND GROW BEFORE BEING RELEASED INTO SOCIETY AT LARGE. MEMBERS OF THIS COMMUNITY FANS ARE IN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER AT CONVENTIONS OR CLUBS THROUGH PRINT OR ONLINE FANZINES OR ON THE INTERNET USING WEB SITES MAILING LISTS AND OTHER RESOURCES.
SF FANDOM EMERGED FROM THE LETTERS COLUMN IN AMAZING STORIES MAGAZINE. SOON FANS BEGAN WRITING LETTERS TO EACH OTHER AND THEN GROUPING THEIR COMMENTS TOGETHER IN INFORMAL PUBLICATIONS THAT BECAME KNOWN AS FANZINES. ONCE THEY WERE IN REGULAR CONTACT FANS WANTED TO MEET EACH OTHER AND THEY ORGANIZED LOCAL CLUBS. IN THE 1930S THE FIRST SCIENCE FICTION CONVENTIONS GATHERED FANS FROM A WIDER AREA. CONVENTIONS CLUBS AND FANZINES WERE THE MAIN FAN ACTIVITIES OR FANAC FOR DECADES UNTIL THE INTERNET IMPROVED COMMUNICATION AMONG A MUCH LARGER POPULATION OF INTERESTED PEOPLE.
THERE ARE TWO VERY IMPORTANT SCIENCE FICTION AWARDS THE HUGO AWARD AND THE NEBULA AWARD. THE HUGO IS PRESENTED BY THE WORLD SCIENCE FICTION SOCIETY AT WORLDCON EACH YEAR. THE NEBULA IS PRESENTED BY SFWA AND VOTED ON BY THE COMMUNITY OF AUTHORS. ONE IMPORTANT AWARD FOR SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES IS THE SATURN AWARD. THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCE FICTION FANTASY AND HORROR MOVIES GIVES THIS AWARD EACH YEAR..
THERE ARE NATIONAL AWARDS LIKE CANADA S AURORA AWARD AND THE UK ARTHUR C. CLARKE AWARD REGIONAL AWARDS LIKE THE ENDEAVOUR AWARD PRESENTED AT ORYCON FOR WORKS FROM THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST SPECIAL INTEREST OR SUBGENRE AWARDS LIKE THE CHESLEY AWARD FOR ART OR THE WORLD FANTASY AWARD FOR FANTASY. MAGAZINES MAY ORGANIZE READER POLLS NOTABLY THE LOCUS AWARD.
CONVENTIONS IN FANDOM SHORTENED AS CONS ARE HELD IN CITIES AROUND THE WORLD CATERING TO A LOCAL REGIONAL NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL MEMBERSHIP. GENERAL INTEREST CONVENTIONS COVER ALL ASPECTS OF SCIENCE FICTION WHILE OTHERS FOCUS ON A PARTICULAR INTEREST LIKE MEDIA FANDOM FILKING ETC. MOST ARE ORGANIZED BY VOLUNTEERS IN NON PROFIT GROUPS THOUGH MOST MEDIA ORIENTED EVENTS ARE ORGANIZED BY COMMERCIAL PROMOTERS. THE CONVENTION S ACTIVITIES ARE CALLED THE PROGRAM WHICH MAY INCLUDE PANEL DISCUSSIONS READINGS AUTOGRAPH SESSIONS COSTUME MASQUERADES AND OTHER EVENTS. ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE CONVENTION ARE NOT PART OF THE PROGRAM THESE COMMONLY INCLUDE A DEALER S ROOM ART SHOW AND HOSPITALITY LOUNGE OR CON SUITES.
CONVENTIONS MAY HOST AWARD CEREMONIES. WORLDCONS PRESENT THE HUGO AWARDS EACH YEAR. SF SOCIETIES ARE A YEAR ROUND BASE OF ACTIVITIES FOR SCIENCE FICTION FANS. THEY MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH AN ONGOING SCIENCE FICTION CONVENTION OR HAVE REGULAR CLUB MEETINGS OR BOTH. MOST GROUPS MEET IN LIBRARIES SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES COMMUNITY CENTERS PUBS OR RESTAURANTS OR THE HOMES OF INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS. LONG ESTABLISHED GROUPS LIKE THE NEW ENGLAND SCIENCE FICTION ASSOCIATION AND THE LOS ANGELES SCIENCE FANTASY SOCIETY HAVE CLUBHOUSES FOR MEETINGS AND STORAGE OF CONVENTION SUPPLIES AND RESEARCH MATERIALS.
THE SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY WRITERS OF AMERICA SFWA WAS FOUNDED BY DAMON KNIGHT IN 1965 AS A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY OF PROFESSIONAL SCIENCE FICTION AUTHORS 24 YEARS AFTER HIS ESSAY UNITE OR FIE HAD LED TO THE ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL FANTASY FAN FEDERATION. FANDOM HAS HELPED SUPPORT RELATED GROUPS AS THEY STARTED TO FORM INCLUDING MEDIA FANDOM THE SOCIETY FOR CREATIVE ANACHRONISM GAMING FILKING AND FURRY FANDOM.
THE FIRST SCIENCE FICTION FANZINE THE COMET WAS PUBLISHED IN 1930. FANZINE PRINTING METHODS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE DECADES FROM THE MIMEOGRAPH AND THE DITTO MACHINE TO MODERN PHOTOCOPYING. THE NUMBER OF COPIES WAS USUALLY NOT ENOUGH TO USE COMMERCIAL PRINTING. MODERN FANZINES ARE PRINTED ON COMPUTER PRINTERS OR AT LOCAL COPY SHOPS OR THEY MAY ONLY BE SENT AS EMAIL. THE BEST KNOWN FANZINE OR ZINE TODAY IS ANSIBLE. DAVID LANGFORD IS THE EDITOR AND IT HAS WON SEVERAL HUGO AWARDS. ARTISTS WORKING FOR FANZINES HAVE RISEN TO PROMINENCE IN THE FIELD INCLUDING BRAD W. FOSTER TEDDY HARVIA AND JOE MAYHEW THE HUGOS INCLUDE A CATEGORY FOR BEST FAN ARTISTS. THE EARLIEST ORGANIZED FANDOM ONLINE WAS THE SF LOVERS COMMUNITY ORIGINALLY A MAILING LIST IN THE LATE 1970S WITH A TEXT ARCHIVE FILE THAT WAS UPDATED REGULARLY. IN THE 1980S USENET GROUPS GREATLY EXPANDED THE CIRCLE OF FANS ONLINE. IN THE 1990S THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB MADE THE ONLINE FAN COMMUNITY MUCH MUCH LARGER. FANS CREATED THOUSANDS AND THEN MILLIONS OF WEB SITES DEVOTED TO SCIENCE FICTION AND RELATED GENRES FOR ALL MEDIA. MOST OF THESE WEBSITES ARE SMALL EPHEMERAL OR ABOUT VERY SPECIFIC TOPICS. THOUGH SITES LIKE SF SITE AND READ AND FIND OUT GIVE READERS A BROAD RANGE OF REFERENCES AND REVIEWS ABOUT SCIENCE FICTION.
FAN FICTION IS NON COMMERCIAL FICTION CREATED BY PEOPLE WHO LOVE AN SF STORY OR WORLD. FANS WRITE STORIES THAT TAKE PLACE IN THE SETTING OF AN ESTABLISHED BOOK MOVIE OR TELEVISION SERIES. SOME PEOPLE CALL IT FANFIC. IN SOME CASES THE COPYRIGHT OWNERS OF THE BOOKS MOVIES OR TELEVISION SERIES HAVE INSTRUCTED THEIR LAWYERS TO ISSUE CEASE AND DESIST LETTERS TO FANS.
SCIENTIFIC METHOD
SCIENTIFIC METHOD REFERS TO WAYS TO INVESTIGATE PHENOMENA GET NEW KNOWLEDGE CORRECT ERRORS AND MISTAKES AND TEST THEORIES. 
THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY SAYS THAT SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS A METHOD OR PROCEDURE THAT HAS CHARACTERIZED NATURAL SCIENCE SINCE THE 17TH CENTURY CONSISTING IN SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION MEASUREMENT AND EXPERIMENT AND THE FORMULATION TESTING AND MODIFICATION OF HYPOTHESES.
A SCIENTIST GATHERS EMPIRICAL AND MEASURABLE EVIDENCE AND USES SOUND REASONING. NEW KNOWLEDGE OFTEN NEEDS ADJUSTING OR FITTING INTO PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE. 
WHAT DISTINGUISHES A SCIENTIFIC METHOD OF INQUIRY IS A QUESTION KNOWN AS THE CRITERION. IT IS AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS THERE A WAY TO TELL WHETHER A CONCEPT OR THEORY IS SCIENCE AS OPPOSED TO SOME OTHER KIND OF KNOWLEDGE OR BELIEF THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IDEAS AS TO HOW IT SHOULD BE EXPRESSED. LOGICAL POSITIVISTS THOUGHT A THEORY WAS SCIENTIFIC IF IT COULD BE VERIFIED BUT KARL POPPER THOUGHT THIS WAS A MISTAKE. HE THOUGHT A THEORY WAS NOT SCIENTIFIC UNLESS THERE WAS SOME WAY IT MIGHT BE REFUTED. ON THE OTHER HAND PAUL FEYERABEND THOUGHT THERE WAS NO CRITERION. FOR HIM ANYTHING GOES OR WHATEVER WORKS WORKS.
SCIENTISTS TRY TO LET REALITY SPEAK FOR ITSELF. THEY SUPPORT A THEORY WHEN ITS PREDICTIONS ARE CONFIRMED AND CHALLENGE IT WHEN ITS PREDICTIONS PROVE FALSE. SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHERS OFFER HYPOTHESES AS EXPLANATIONS OF PHENOMENA AND DESIGN EXPERIMENTS TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES. SINCE BIG THEORIES CANNOT BE TESTED DIRECTLY IT IS DONE BY TESTING PREDICTIONS DERIVED FROM THE THEORY. THESE STEPS MUST BE REPEATABLE TO GUARD AGAINST MISTAKE OR CONFUSION BY ANY PARTICULAR EXPERIMENTER. 
SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY IS GENERALLY INTENDED TO BE AS OBJECTIVE AS POSSIBLE. TO REDUCE BIASED INTERPRETATIONS OF RESULTS SCIENTISTS PUBLISH THEIR WORK AND SO SHARE DATA AND METHODS WITH OTHER SCIENTISTS.
SCIENCE AND THINGS THAT ARE NOT SCIENCE SUCH AS PSEUDOSCIENCE ARE OFTEN DISTINGUISHED BY WHETHER THEY USE THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO CREATE AN OUTLINE OF THE STEPS IN THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD WAS JOHN STUART MILL.
THERE IS NO ONE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. SOME FIELDS OF SCIENCE ARE BASED ON MATHEMATICAL MODELS SUCH AS PHYSICS AND CLIMATE SCIENCE. OTHER FIELDS SUCH AS MANY FIELDS OF SOCIAL SCIENCE HAVE ROUGH THEORIES AND RELY MORE ON PATTERNS THAT EMERGE FROM THEIR DATA. SOMETIMES SCIENTISTS FOCUS ON TESTING AND CONFIRMING HYPOTHESES BUT OPEN ENDED EXPLORATION IS ALSO IMPORTANT. SOME SCIENTIFIC FIELDS USE LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS. OTHERS COLLECT OBSERVATIONS FROM REAL WORLD SITUATIONS. MANY AREAS OF SCIENCE ARE QUANTITATIVE EMPHASIZING NUMERICAL DATA AND MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS. BUT SOME AREAS ESPECIALLY IN SOCIAL SCIENCE USE QUALITATIVE METHODS SUCH AS INTERVIEWS OR DETAILED OBSERVATIONS OF HUMAN OR ANIMAL BEHAVIOR. FOCUSING TOO MUCH ONE KIND OF METHOD CAN LEAD US TO IGNORE KNOWLEDGE PRODUCED USING OTHER METHODS. 
SOME TEXTBOOKS FOCUS ON A SINGLE STANDARD SCIENTIFIC METHOD. THIS IDEA OF A SINGLE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS LARGELY BASED ON EXPERIMENTAL HYPOTHESIS TESTING QUANTITATIVE AREAS OF SCIENCE. IT DOESN T APPLY VERY WELL TO OTHER AREAS OF SCIENCE. IT IS OFTEN WRITTEN AS A NUMBER OF STEPS 
ALTHOUGH WRITTEN AS A LIST SCIENTISTS MAY BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DIFFERENT STEPS A NUMBER OF TIMES BEFORE BEING SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER.
NOT ALL SCIENTISTS USE THE ABOVE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN THEIR DAY TO DAY WORK. SOMETIMES THE ACTUAL WORK OF SCIENCE LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE ABOVE.
LET S SAY WE ARE GOING FIND OUT THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE WAY SUGAR DISSOLVES IN A GLASS OF WATER. BELOW IS ONE WAY TO DO THIS FOLLOWING THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD STEP BY STEP.
DOES SUGAR DISSOLVE FASTER IN HOT WATER OR COLD WATER DOES THE TEMPERATURE AFFECT HOW FAST THE SUGAR DISSOLVES THIS IS A QUESTION WE MIGHT WANT TO ASK.
ONE SIMPLE EXPERIMENT WOULD BE TO DISSOLVE SUGAR IN WATER OF DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES AND TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES FOR THE SUGAR TO DISSOLVE. THIS WOULD BE A TEST OF THE IDEA THAT THE RATE OF DISSOLVING VARIES ACCORDING TO THE KINETIC ENERGY OF THE SOLVENT.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TO USE THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF WATER IN EACH TRIAL AND THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF SUGAR. WE DO THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TEMPERATURE ALONE CAUSES THE EFFECT. IT MIGHT BE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE RATIO OF SUGAR TO WATER IS ALSO A FACTOR IN THE RATE OF DISSOLVING. TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL WE MIGHT ALSO RUN THE EXPERIMENT SO THAT THE WATER TEMPERATURE DOES NOT CHANGE DURING THE EXPERIMENT.
THIS IS CALLED ISOLATING A VARIABLE. THIS MEANS THAT OF THE FACTORS WHICH MIGHT HAVE AN EFFECT ONLY ONE IS BEING CHANGED IN THE EXPERIMENT.
WE WILL DO THE EXPERIMENT IN THREE TRIALS WHICH ARE EXACTLY THE SAME EXCEPT FOR THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER.
ONE WAY THAT MAKES IT EASY TO SEE RESULTS IS TO MAKE A TABLE OF THEM LISTING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT CHANGED EACH TIME WE RAN THE EXPERIMENT. OURS MIGHT LOOK LIKE THIS 
IF EVERY OTHER PART OF THE EXPERIMENT WAS THE SAME WE DID NOT USE MORE SUGAR ONE TIME THAN THE OTHER WE DID NOT STIR ONE TIME OR THE OTHER ETC. THEN THIS WOULD BE VERY GOOD EVIDENCE THAT HEAT AFFECTS HOW FAST SUGAR IS DISSOLVED. 
WE CANNOT KNOW FOR SURE THOUGH THAT THERE IS NOT SOMETHING ELSE AFFECTING IT. AN EXAMPLE OF A HIDDEN CAUSE MIGHT BE THAT SUGAR DISSOLVES FASTER EACH TIME MORE SUGAR IS DISSOLVED INTO THE SAME POT. THIS IS PROBABLY NOT TRUE BUT IF IT WERE IT COULD MAKE THE RESULTS EXACTLY THE SAME THREE TRIALS AND THE LAST ONE WOULD BE FASTEST. WE HAVE NO REASON TO THINK THAT THIS IS TRUE AT THIS TIME BUT WE MIGHT WANT TO NOTE IT AS ANOTHER POSSIBLE ANSWER.
THE REPLICATION CRISIS OR REPLICABILITY CRISIS REFERS TO A CRISIS IN SCIENCE. VERY OFTEN THE RESULT OF A SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT IS DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO REPLICATE LATER EITHER BY INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS OR BY THE ORIGINAL RESEARCHERS THEMSELVES. WHILE THE CRISIS HAS LONG STANDING ROOTS THE PHRASE WAS COINED IN THE EARLY 2010S AS PART OF A GROWING AWARENESS OF THE PROBLEM.
SINCE THE REPRODUCIBILITY OF EXPERIMENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD THE INABILITY TO REPLICATE STUDIES HAS POTENTIALLY GRAVE CONSEQUENCES.
THE REPLICATION CRISIS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY WIDELY DISCUSSED IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY AND IN PARTICULAR SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY AND IN MEDICINE WHERE A NUMBER OF EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO RE INVESTIGATE CLASSIC RESULTS AND TO ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE BOTH THE VALIDITY OF THE RESULTS AND IF INVALID THE REASONS FOR THE FAILURE OF REPLICATION.
RECENT DISCUSSIONS HAVE MADE THIS PROBLEM BETTER KNOWN.
ELEMENTS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD WERE WORKED OUT BY SOME EARLY STUDENTS OF NATURE. 
SHIP
A SHIP IS A LARGE VEHICLE USED TO TRAVEL ON WATER. IT IS BIGGER THAN A BOAT. SHIPS ARE USED FOR TRAVEL TRADE AND WAR. THEY HAVE LONG BEEN SPECIALIZED WITH DIFFERENT KINDS FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES.
THE FIRST SHIPS USED OARS OR THE WIND OR BOTH TO MAKE THEM MOVE.
FROM ABOUT 4000 BC THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS WERE MAKING WOODEN SAIL BOATS. BY 1200 BC THE PHOENICIANS AND GREEKS HAD BEGUN TO MAKE BIGGER SAILING SHIPS WHICH WERE ABOUT 30 METRES 100 FEET LONG AND COULD CARRY 90180 TONNES OF CARGO. THE ROMANS MADE EVEN BIGGER SHIPS WHICH COULD CARRY UP TO 1 000 PEOPLE AND 1 000 TONNES OF CARGO. THE 8TH CENTURY SAW THE RISE OF THE VIKINGS WHO WERE FAMOUS FOR THEIR LONGSHIPS AND WHICH WERE MAINLY USED FOR RAIDING OTHER COUNTRIES BUT ALSO FOR TRADING. THE LONGSHIPS HAD FLAT BOTTOMS SO THEY COULD MOVE IN SHALLOW NOT DEEP RIVERS.
SAILING SHIPS WERE USED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS BUT THEY WERE VERY IMPORTANT IN WARS AND TRADE FROM THE 1500 S TO THE 1800 S. THE CHINESE ADMIRAL ZHENG HE COMMANDED A FLEET OF TREASURE SHIPS ON SEVEN VOYAGES ALL OVER ASIA UP TO EAST AFRICA IN THE EARLY FIFTEENTH CENTURY. THESE SHIPS PROBABLY WERE ABOUT 130 M 450 FT LONG AND UP TO 50 M 180 FT WIDE. THAT MAKES THEM ABOUT TWICE THE SIZE OF THE LARGEST EUROPEAN SHIPS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND LARGEST FLEET IN THE 17TH CENTURY WAS THE DUTCH FLEET SEE THE NETHERLANDS. FOR TRADE AND TRANSPORT THE DUTCH OFTEN USED A PARTICULAR KIND OF TRADING SHIP CALLED A FLUTE FLUIT IN DUTCH. TRANSPORT OF PEOPLE AND CARGO ON SAILING SHIPS CONTINUED UNTIL THE 1920 S. 
SOME FAMOUS SHIPS FROM THIS ERA INCLUDE 
IN THE 19TH CENTURY STEAMBOATS BECAME COMMONPLACE.
AT ONE TIME THE STEAMSHIPS TITANIC OLYMPIC AND BRITANNIC WERE THE LARGEST SHIPS IN THE WORLD TITANIC SANK ON HER MAIDEN VOYAGE AFTER HITTING AN ICEBERG BECOMING ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS SHIPWRECKS OF ALL TIME THE OLYMPIC WAS TITANIC S NEARLY IDENTICAL TWIN AND ACTUALLY SET SAIL BEFORE TITANIC AND WAS SCRAPPED IN THE 1930 S AFTER A VERY SUCCESSFUL CAREER INCLUDING HER BEING A PASSENGER LINER AND A WARSHIP IN WORLD WAR I. THE BRITANNIC WAS THE LARGEST OF THESE THREE SISTER SHIPS AND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MORE GRAND AND ELEGANT THAN THE TITANIC BUT BEFORE SHE SET SAIL ON HER MAIDEN VOYAGE WWI BROKE OUT AND SHE WAS STRIPPED OF HER ELEGANT FURNITURE AND ELABORATE PANELING AND BECAME A HOSPITAL SHIP. DURING HER TERM AS A HOSPITAL SHIP SHE WAS SUNK BY EITHER A MINE OR TORPEDO NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE. THE TITANIC LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN OFF THE COAST OF NOVA SCOTIA AND THE BRITANNIC LIES IN THE AEGEAN SEA OFF THE COAST OF THE ISLAND OF KEA.
AFTER WORLD WAR II SHIPS WITH DIESEL ENGINES BECAME COMMONPLACE. PASSENGER AIRLINERS REPLACED PASSENGER SHIPS FOR LONG TRIPS IN THE LATE 20TH CENTURY. CARGO SHIPS BECAME MUCH BIGGER. THE MAIN KINDS ARE CONTAINER SHIPS FOR MOSTLY MANUFACTURED GOODS AND BULK CARRIERS INCLUDING OIL TANKERS.
THE WORLD S LARGEST SHIP IS THE PRELUDE OWNED BY SHELL. IT IS BEING BUILT ON GEOJE ISLAND SOUTH KOREA. IT IS 488M LONG AND HAS THE INTERNAL CAPACITY GREATER THAN THE TOTAL VOLUME OF FOUR LARGE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS. WHAT IT WILL DO IS COLLECT NATURAL GAS OFF THE COAST OF AUSTRALIA AND LIQUIFY IT. WHEN LIQUIFIED THE HYDROCARBON TAKES UP 600 TIMES LESS SPACE THAN ITS GAS. SMALLER TANKERS WILL TAKE THE LIQUID GAS TO ITS BUYERS. THE SHIP WILL DO LIQUIFYING AND TEMPORARY STORAGE WHICH IS USUALLY DONE ON LAND. SHELL BELIEVES THIS JUSTIFIES THE COST OF THE SHIP.
THE SHIPPING YARD BUILDS ALL KINDS OF STRUCTURES FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY. IT EMPLOYS 30 000 WORKERS.
SLAVERY
SLAVERY IS WHEN A PERSON CALLED A SLAVE IS TREATED AS THE PROPERTY OF ANOTHER PERSON CALLED A MASTER. IT OFTEN MEANS THAT SLAVES ARE FORCED TO WORK OR ELSE THEY WILL BE PUNISHED BY THE LAW IF SLAVERY IS LEGAL IN THAT PLACE OR BY THEIR MASTER.
THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT EVEN BEFORE THERE WAS WRITING THERE WAS SLAVERY. THERE HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF SLAVERY AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN ALMOST ALL CULTURES AND CONTINENTS. SOME SOCIETIES HAD LAWS ABOUT SLAVERY OR THEY HAD AN ECONOMY THAT WAS BUILT ON IT. ANCIENT GREECE AND ANCIENT ROME HAD MANY SLAVES.
DURING THE 20TH CENTURY ALMOST ALL COUNTRIES MADE LAWS FORBIDDING SLAVERY. THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS SAYS THAT SLAVERY IS WRONG. SLAVERY IS NOW BANNED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE STILL DIFFERENT FORMS OF SLAVERY IN SOME COUNTRIES.
THE ENGLISH WORD SLAVE COMES FROM THE MEDIEVAL WORD FOR THE SLAVIC PEOPLES OF CENTRAL EUROPE AND EASTERN EUROPE BECAUSE THESE WERE THE LAST ETHNIC GROUP TO BE CAPTURED AND ENSLAVED IN CENTRAL EUROPE. ACCORDING TO ADAM SMITH AND AUGUSTE COMTE A SLAVE WAS MAINLY DEFINED AS A CAPTIVE OR PRISONER OF WAR. SLAVE HOLDERS USED TO BUY SLAVES AT SLAVE AUCTIONS. IN MANY CASES SLAVES ARE NOT ALLOWED RIGHTS. 
IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER SLAVERY HAS BEEN PRACTICED SINCE THE EARLIEST CIVILIZATIONS. EARLY HUNTER GATHERERS HAD NO USE FOR SLAVES. THEY DID EVERYTHING FOR THEMSELVES. HAVING ANOTHER PAIR OF HANDS TO HELP THEM MEANT ANOTHER MOUTH TO FEED. SLAVERY OR OWNING ANOTHER PERSON MADE NO SENSE TO THESE PEOPLE. ONCE MEN GATHERED IN CITIES AND TOWNS AND THERE WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOOD HAVING A CHEAP SUPPLY OF LABOR MADE SENSE. THIS IS WHEN THE EARLIEST FORMS OF SLAVERY APPEARED. SLAVERY CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE EARLIEST RECORDS SUCH AS THE CODE OF HAMMURABI C. 1760 BC. THIS REFERS TO IT AS AN ESTABLISHED INSTITUTION.
IN THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST CAPTIVES OBTAINED THROUGH WARFARE OFTEN BECAME SLAVES. THIS WAS SEEN BY THE LAWS IN THE BIBLE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY AS A LEGAL FORM OF SLAVERY. BUT THE ISRAELITES WERE NOT ALLOWED TO ENSLAVE OTHER ISRAELITES. THE DEUTERONOMIC CODE CALLS FOR THE DEATH PENALTY FOR THE CRIME OF KIDNAPPING ISRAELITES TO ENSLAVE THEM.
IN ANCIENT EGYPT SLAVES WERE MAINLY PRISONERS OF WAR. OTHER WAYS PEOPLE COULD BECOME SLAVES WAS BY INHERITING THE STATUS FROM THEIR PARENTS WHO WERE SLAVES. SOMEONE COULD BECOME A SLAVE IF HE COULD NOT PAY HIS DEBTS. PEOPLE ALSO SOLD THEMSELVES INTO SLAVERY BECAUSE THEY WERE POOR PEASANTS AND NEEDED FOOD AND SHELTER. THE LIVES OF SLAVES WERE NORMALLY BETTER THAN THAT OF PEASANTS. YOUNG SLAVES COULD NOT BE PUT TO HARD WORK AND HAD TO BE BROUGHT UP BY THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSEHOLD. NOT ALL SLAVES WENT TO HOUSES. SOME ALSO SOLD THEMSELVES TO TEMPLES OR WERE ASSIGNED TO TEMPLES BY THE KING. SLAVE TRADING WAS NOT VERY POPULAR UNTIL LATER IN ANCIENT EGYPT. AFTERWARDS SLAVE TRADES SPRANG UP ALL OVER EGYPT.
IN MANY PLACES CITIZENS WERE PARTLY OR FULLY PROTECTED FROM BEING ENSLAVED SO MOST SLAVES WERE FOREIGNERS.
ROMAN SLAVES PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SOCIETY AND THE ECONOMY. BESIDES MANUAL LABOR SLAVES PERFORMED MANY DOMESTIC SERVICES. THEY COULD WORK AT HIGHLY SKILLED JOBS AND PROFESSIONS. TEACHERS ACCOUNTANTS AND PHYSICIANS WERE OFTEN SLAVES. GREEK SLAVES WERE OFTEN HIGHLY EDUCATED. UNSKILLED SLAVES OR THOSE SENTENCED TO SLAVERY AS PUNISHMENT WORKED ON FARMS IN MINES AND AT MILLS. THEIR LIVING CONDITIONS WERE BRUTAL AND THEIR LIVES SHORT.
SLAVES WERE CONSIDERED PROPERTY UNDER ROMAN LAW AND HAD NO LEGAL PERSONHOOD. UNLIKE ROMAN CITIZENS THEY COULD BE SUBJECTED TO CORPORAL PUNISHMENT SEXUAL EXPLOITATION PROSTITUTES WERE OFTEN SLAVES TORTURE AND SUMMARY EXECUTION. THE TESTIMONY OF A SLAVE COULD NOT BE ACCEPTED IN A COURT OF LAW UNLESS THE SLAVE WAS TORTURED A PRACTICE BASED ON THE BELIEF THAT SLAVES IN A POSITION TO BE PRIVY TO THEIR MASTERS AFFAIRS WOULD BE TOO VIRTUOUSLY LOYAL TO REVEAL DAMAGING EVIDENCE UNLESS COERCED. OVER TIME HOWEVER SLAVES GAINED INCREASED LEGAL PROTECTION INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO FILE COMPLAINTS AGAINST THEIR MASTERS. ATTITUDES CHANGED IN PART BECAUSE OF THE INFLUENCE AMONG THE EDUCATED ELITE OF THE STOICS WHOSE EGALITARIAN VIEWS OF HUMANITY EXTENDED TO SLAVES.
ROMAN SLAVES COULD HOLD PROPERTY WHICH EVEN THOUGH IT BELONGED TO THEIR MASTERS THEY WERE ALLOWED TO USE AS IF IT WERE THEIR OWN. SKILLED OR EDUCATED SLAVES WERE ALLOWED TO EARN THEIR OWN MONEY. WITH ENOUGH MONEY THEY COULD BUY THEIR FREEDOM.
HISTORIANS ESTIMATE THAT BETWEEN 650 AD AND THE 1960S 10 TO 18 MILLION PEOPLE WERE ENSLAVED BY ARAB SLAVE TRADERS. THEY WERE TAKEN FROM EUROPE ASIA AND AFRICA ACROSS THE RED SEA INDIAN OCEAN AND SAHARA DESERT. MALE SLAVES WERE OFTEN EMPLOYED AS SERVANTS SOLDIERS OR WORKERS BY THEIR OWNERS. MOST MALE SLAVES WERE CASTRATED. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT AS MANY AS 6 OUT OF EVERY 10 BOYS BLED TO DEATH DURING THE PROCESS. BUT THE HIGH PRICE OF EUNUCHS MADE IT WORTHWHILE. WOMAN AND CHILDREN TAKEN AS SLAVES WERE MAINLY USED AS SERVANTS AND CONCUBINES. WHILE THE LATER ATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE CONCENTRATED ON MEN FOR LABOR THE ARAB SLAVE TRADE STARTED WITH MEN AND BOYS BUT SHIFTED OVER TIME TO CONCENTRATE MORE ON WOMAN AND YOUNG GIRLS FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES.
FOR FOUR CENTURIES BEGINNING IN THE LATE 15TH CENTURY MILLIONS OF AFRICANS WERE TAKEN AS SLAVES BY EUROPEANS. THE EUROPEANS WERE NOT THE FIRST TO EXPLOIT AFRICA FOR MANPOWER. BEGINNING IN ABOUT 650 AD ARAB SLAVE TRADERS BEGAN TAKING SLAVES FROM AFRICA. THEY DEALT MAINLY IN CASTRATED MALE SLAVES EUNUCHS. ACCORDING TO RONALD SEGAL AUTHOR OF ISLAM S BLACK SLAVES THE OTHER BLACK DIASPORA 2002 THE CALIPHA IN BAGHDAD AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 10TH CENTURY HAD 7 000 BLACK EUNUCHS AND 4 000 WHITE EUNUCHS IN HIS PALACE. BY THE 1900S ARAB SLAVE TRADERS HAD TAKEN BETWEEN 10 AND 20 MILLION SLAVES OUT OF AFRICA. IT IS NOT CERTAIN THAT EUROPEAN SLAVE TRADERS OBTAINED BLACK SLAVES FROM THE ARAB SLAVE TRADERS. THE ARABS CONCENTRATED MAINLY ON SUPPLYING THEIR OWN NEEDS. EUROPEANS BEGAN EXPORTING AFRICANS TO THE NEW WORLD AS A SOURCE OF CHEAP LABOR ON COLONIAL PLANTATIONS. 
BETWEEN 1452 AND 1455 POPE NICOLAS V ISSUED A SERIES OF PAPAL BULLS AUTHORIZING THE PORTUGUESE TO TAKE AFRICAN SLAVES. AT FIRST SLAVE TRADERS RAIDED COASTAL AREAS AND CARRIED BLACK PEOPLE OFF. BUT THE MINES AND FIELDS OF THE COLONIES NEEDED MORE AND MORE SLAVES. IN THE EARLY 16TH CENTURY SPAIN BEGAN TO ISSUE LICENSES AND CONTRACTS TO SUPPLY SLAVES. BY THE 1750S LARGE SLAVING COMPANIES WERE ESTABLISHED. MOST OF EUROPE AT THE TIME WAS INVOLVED IN THE SLAVE TRADE.
MANY EUROPEANS WHO ARRIVED IN NORTH AMERICA DURING THE 17TH AND 18TH CENTURIES CAME UNDER CONTRACT AS INDENTURED SERVANTS. THE CHANGE FROM INDENTURED SERVITUDE TO SLAVERY WAS A GRADUAL PROCESS IN VIRGINIA. THE EARLIEST LEGAL DOCUMENTATION OF SUCH A SHIFT WAS IN 1640. THIS IS WHERE A NEGRO JOHN PUNCH WAS SENTENCED TO LIFETIME SLAVERY FOR ATTEMPTING TO RUN AWAY. THIS CASE ALSO MARKED THE DISPARATE TREATMENT OF AFRICANS AS HELD BY THE VIRGINIA COUNTY COURT WHERE TWO WHITE RUNAWAYS RECEIVED FAR LESSER SENTENCES. AFTER 1640 PLANTERS STARTED TO IGNORE THE EXPIRATION OF INDENTURED CONTRACTS. THEY KEPT THEIR SERVANTS AS SLAVES FOR LIFE. THIS WAS DEMONSTRATED BY THE CASE JOHNSON V. PARKER. THE COURT RULED THAT JOHN CASOR AN INDENTURED SERVANT BE RETURNED TO JOHNSON WHO CLAIMED THAT CASOR BELONGED TO HIM FOR HIS LIFE. ACCORDING TO THE 1860 U. S. CENSUS 393 975 INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING 8 OF ALL US FAMILIES OWNED 3 950 528 SLAVES. ONE THIRD OF SOUTHERN FAMILIES OWNED SLAVES. SLAVERY IN UNITED STATES WAS LEGALLY ABOLISHED BY THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION IN 1865.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE STILL SLAVES IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD MOSTLY IN SOUTH ASIA AND AFRICA. IT IS LESS COMMON IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD BECAUSE OF BETTER LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT IT STILL HAPPENS THERE AS WELL. THE WAYS IN WHICH IT IS DONE HAVE CHANGED. TODAY SLAVES MAY WORK BECAUSE OF THINGS LIKE A HIGH DEBT FOR EXAMPLE SLAVES HAVE TO WORK TO PAY OFF A DEBT. MANY VICTIMS ARE TOLD THAT THEIR FAMILIES WILL BE HARMED IF THEY REPORT THE SLAVE OWNERS. MANY SLAVES ARE FORCED TO BE DOMESTIC SERVANTS. IN SOME CASES THEIR FAMILIES SELL THEM TO THE SLAVE OWNERS. SOME SLAVES HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED FROM ONE PART OF THE WORLD TO ANOTHER. THESE PEOPLE ARE ILLEGALLY IN THEIR HOST COUNTRY AND THEREFORE DO NOT REPORT THE ABUSE. FORCED PROSTITUTION IS A TYPE OF SLAVERY. ANOTHER FORM OF SLAVERY STILL HAPPENING TODAY IS FORCED CHILD LABOR. SOME CHILDREN HAVE TO WORK IN MINES OR IN PLANTATIONS OR THEY HAVE TO FIGHT WARS AS CHILD SOLDIERS FOR NO PAY. 
ONE STUDY SAYS THAT THERE ARE 27 MILLION PEOPLE BUT OTHERS SAY THERE COULD BE AS MANY AS 200 MILLION IN SLAVERY TODAY.
OTHER TERMS THAT DESCRIBE THE RECRUITEMENT OF LABORERS AND THAT MAY HAVE SIMILARITIES TO SLAVERY ARE BLACKBIRDING IMPRESSMENT AND SHANGHAIING. 
SOME OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS STILL SLAVERY ARE IN AFRICA THE MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTH ASIA. IN SUMMER 2007 570 PEOPLE WERE FOUND TO BE SLAVES FOR BRICK MAKERS IN CHINA. OF THOSE FREES THEIR WERE 69 CHILDREN. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT MADE A FORCE OF 35 000 POLICE CHECK NORTHERN CHINESE BRICK KILNS FOR SLAVES AND SENT LOTS OF KILN SUPERVISORS AND OFFICIALS TO PRISON AND SENTENCED ONE KILN FOREMAN TO DEATH FOR KILLING A WORKER WHO WAS A SLAVE.
IN MAURITANIA IT IS THOUGHT THAT UP TO 600 000 MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN OR 20 OF THE POPULATION ARE SLAVES AND THAT MANY OF THEM ARE USED AS BONDED LABOUR. SLAVERY IN MAURITANIA WAS MADE ILLEGAL IN AUGUST 2007. IN NIGER THERE IS ALSO MUCH SLAVERY. A NIGERIAN STUDY HAS FOUND THAT MORE THAN 800 000 PEOPLE ARE SLAVES ALMOST 8 OF THE POPULATION. CHILD SLAVERY HAS COMMONLY BEEN USED WHEN MAKING CASH CROPS AND MINING. ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE MORE THAN 109 000 CHILDREN WERE WORKING ON COCOA FARMS ALONE IN C TE D IVOIRE IVORY COAST IN THE WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOUR IN 2002.
IN NOVEMBER 2006 THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION SAID THAT IT WOULD PROSECUTE MEMBERS OF THE JUNTA THAT RULES MYANMAR ALSO CALLED BURMA AT THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MILITARY MAKES SOME CITIZENS DO FORCED LABOUR. THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION SAYS THAT IT THINKS THAT ABOUT 800 000 PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO WORK THIS WAY. 
SCHOLARS OF ISLAMIC LAW HAVE CONDEMNED THE REVIVAL OF THE SLAVE TRADE OF NON MUSLIM WOMEN BY THE ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND THE LEVANT. 
AN AGITATION CALLED ABOLITIONISM AGAINST SLAVERY BEGAN IN CHRISTIAN COUNTRIES IN THE 18TH CENTURY. FIRST THEY ABOLISHED THE SLAVE TRADE SO MORE PEOPLE WOULDN T BECOME SLAVES. IN 1833 THE BRITISH EMPIRE STOPPED SLAVERY. SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES FOLLOWED. IN THE UNITED STATES DISAGREEMENT OVER SLAVERY LED TO THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR AND THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION. IN 1865 WHEN THE NORTH WON ALL SLAVES WERE MADE FREE. STILL MORE COUNTRIES ABOLISHED SLAVERY AFTERWARDS. PEDRO II OF BRAZIL ABOLISHED IT IN 1888. FORCED LABOR HOWEVER CONTINUED EITHER AGAINST THE LAW OR BY DEBT PEONAGE OR OTHER METHODS WHICH THE LAWS OF THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES DID NOT COUNT AS SLAVERY. 
SLEEP
SLEEP IS A STATE OF REST WHICH HAPPENS IN ANIMALS INCLUDING HUMANS. ANIMALS THAT SLEEP ARE IN AN UNCONSCIOUS STATE OR MOSTLY SO. MOST OF THE MUSCLES THAT ANIMALS CAN CONTROL ON PURPOSE ARE INACTIVE. ANIMALS THAT ARE ASLEEP DO NOT REACT TO STIMULI AS FAST AS THOSE THAT ARE AWAKE. THEY CAN WAKE UP FROM SLEEP MORE EASILY THAN FROM HIBERNATION OR COMA. ALL MAMMALS AND BIRDS AND MANY REPTILES AMPHIBIANS AND FISH SLEEP. IN HUMANS OTHER MAMMALS AND MOST OTHER ANIMALS THAT WERE STUDIED SLEEPING REGULARLY IS ESSENTIAL FOR SURVIVAL.
THE PURPOSE OF SLEEP IS NOT FULLY KNOWN AND IT IS STILL STUDIED TODAY. WE DO KNOW FOR SURE THOUGH THAT SLEEP IS NECESSARY TO MOST ANIMALS FOR SURVIVAL. NOT HAVING ENOUGH SLEEP CAN EVEN BE USED FOR TORTURE.
A PERSON SLEEPS WHEN HE OR SHE IS NOT AWAKE. USUALLY THIS IS DURING THE NIGHT. DURING THE DAY TIME MOST PEOPLE ARE AWAKE. THEY WORK GO TO SCHOOL COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY OR DO OTHER THINGS. MANY PEOPLE SLEEP FOR A SHORT TIME IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON FOR A QUICK REST. THIS IS OFTEN CALLED A NAP.
IN SOME COUNTRIES MOST NOTABLY WHERE THE WEATHER IS WARM THERE IS A TRADITION TO TAKE A NAP RIGHT AFTER NOON OR EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON. THIS TRADITION IS CALLED SIESTA AND IS MOST COMMON IN SPAIN AND LATIN AMERICA. SOME STORES AND SERVICES EVEN HAVE CLOSED WHILE THEIR OWNERS AND OR EMPLOYEES TAKE THEIR SIESTA.
THE WORD SLEEP COMES FROM THE OLD OLD GERMANIC VERBS FOR SLEEP. IN OLD AND MIDDLE HIGH GERMAN IT WAS CALLED SLAF. THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF THE WORD WAS TO SLAP WHICH WAS RELATED TO THE WORD FOR FLABBY NOT HARD OR FIRM.
MANY WORDS RELATED TO SLEEP HAVE VERY DIFFERENT MEANINGS THOUGH. FOR EXAMPLE SLEEP WAS ALSO USED TO MEAN DEATH SO THAT PUTTING AN ANIMAL TO SLEEP MEANT TO KILL THE ANIMAL WITHOUT PAIN. SLEEP WITH SOMEONE CAN ALSO HAVE A SEXUAL MEANING.
GENERALLY THE REASON FOR SLEEP IS THAT THE BRAIN HAS WORK TO DO DURING SLEEP. THE DETAILS ARE NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET ENOUGH SLEEP FOR THE BODY AND THE BRAIN TO BE HEALTHY AND WORK PROPERLY. USUALLY ANIMALS AND PEOPLE SLEEP AT PERIODIC INTERVALS SUCH AS ONCE A DAY. CERTAIN ANIMALS SEND OUT SIGNALS TO THE OTHERS THAT THEY WILL SOON GO TO SLEEP. YAWNING IS SUCH A SIGNAL.
BOTH HUMANS AND MANY ANIMALS SLEEP ABOUT ONCE A DAY. SOME ANIMALS SUCH AS CATS SLEEP MANY TIMES A DAY FOR SHORT PERIODS.
WHEN PEOPLE SLEEP THEY OFTEN HAVE DREAMS. PROBABLY SOME ANIMALS DO TOO.
NOT ONLY PEOPLE SLEEP ALL MAMMALS AND BIRDS AND MOST FISH REPTILES AND OTHER ANIMALS DO TOO.
IN MAMMALS AND BIRDS SLEEP CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO CATEGORIES. IN ONE OF THEM THE EYES MOVE RAPIDLY. IT IS CALLED REM SLEEP FROM RAPID EYE MOVEMENT. MOST DREAMS TAKE PLACE IN THIS PHASE. REM SLEEP OCCURS NORMALLY AT INTERVALS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AND THE PERIODS OF REM SLEEP INCREASE IN LENGTH IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE NIGHT. REM SLEEP WAS FIRST DISCOVERED IN 1952 53. 
REM SLEEP IS FOUND IN MAMMALS AND SONGBIRDS BUT IS POORLY ESTABLISHED IN REPTILES AND FISH. A SURVEY SUGGESTS 
THE OTHER CATEGORY WHERE THIS MOVEMENT OF THE EYES DOES NOT HAPPEN IS CALLED NREM SLEEP NON REM SLEEP. USUALLY DREAMS DO NOT OCCUR DURING THIS TIME. THERE ARE THREE OR FOUR STAGES OF NREM SLEEP. STAGE I IS JUST BARELY SLEEPING OR DOZING. STAGE II IS ALSO LIGHT SLEEP. NORMALLY IN ADULT HUMANS ABOUT HALF OF THE TIME SPENT ASLEEP IS SPENT IN LIGHT SLEEP. STAGES III AND IV ARE CALLED DEEP SLEEP. DEEP SLEEP IS NECESSARY FOR GROWTH AND HEALING. IT CAN BE QUITE DIFFICULT TO AWAKEN SOMEONE WHO IS IN STAGE III OR STAGE IV SLEEP. SOMETIMES STAGES III AND IV ARE COMBINED AND CALLED STAGE III.
ADULT HUMANS NORMALLY SLEEP IN CYCLES OF 90 TO 110 MINUTES EACH. THE NIGHT S SLEEP CAN BE 4 OR 5 OF THESE CYCLES. EACH CYCLE INCLUDES IN THIS ORDER STAGE I STAGE II STAGE III IV AND REM.
THE TIMING OF SLEEP AND THE AMOUNT OF IT ARE BOTH IMPORTANT. BOTH ARE DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE. SOME ADULTS SLEEP BEST FROM 22 00 TO 05 00 OR 06 00 OR 07 00. SOME SLEEP BEST FROM MIDNIGHT TO SEVEN OR EIGHT. THESE VARIATIONS ARE NORMAL.
HOW MUCH SLEEP IS ENOUGH ALSO DEPENDS ON AGE. CHILDREN NEED MORE SLEEP THAN ADULTS. NEWBORN BABIES SLEEP ABOUT 18 HOURS PER DAY. SMALL BABIES SLEEP MANY TIMES A DAY HUMAN BABIES DO NOT DEVELOP CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS BEFORE THEY ARE 3 4 MONTHS OLD. AT THE AGE OF 1 YEAR THEY SLEEP FOR ABOUT 14 HOURS. 
A NINE YEAR OLD SHOULD SLEEP ABOUT 9 10 HOURS PER DAY AND TEENAGERS TOO ALSO NEED THAT MUCH SLEEP. ADULTS WHO SLEEP LESS THAN ABOUT 8 HOURS A DAY PERFORM WORSE THAN THOSE WHO SLEEP THAT LONG. 
PEOPLE MAY HAVE TROUBLE GOING TO SLEEP STAYING ASLEEP OR GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP. THIS USUALLY MEANS THAT THEY ARE TOO SLEEPY IN THE DAYTIME.
THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT INFLUENCE SLEEP. ALSO SOME SUBSTANCES CALLED STIMULANTS COFFEE IS AN EXAMPLE CAN CAUSE POOR SLEEP. WHEN PEOPLE HAVE JUST EATEN SOMETHING THE BODY IS BUSY DIGESTING WHAT THEY HAVE ATE. THIS CAN CAUSE POOR SLEEP TOO. WORRYING AND STRESS CAN CAUSE POOR SLEEP. 
THERE ARE MANY DISEASES THAT CAUSE POOR SLEEP. FEVER CAN LEAD TO BAD DREAMS. POOR SLEEP CAN BE A SIDE EFFECT OF SOME MEDICATIONS. 
SLEEP DISORDERS DIRECTLY INFLUENCE HOW A PERSON SLEEPS. EXAMPLES OF SLEEP DISORDERS ARE NARCOLEPSY SLEEP APNEA AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHM SLEEP DISORDERS.
SLEEP SPECIALISTS DOCTORS SPECIALISED IN SLEEPING PROBLEMS OFTEN SUGGEST BETTER SLEEP HYGIENE TO PEOPLE WITH SLEEPING PROBLEMS. SLEEP HYGIENE MEANS THINGS PEOPLE CAN TRY SUCH AS 
SNAKE
SNAKES ARE REPTILES. THEY ARE PART OF THE ORDER SQUAMATA. THEY DON T HAVE LEGS VOICE EARS AND EYELIDS. DESPITE THIS SNAKES ARE SUCCESSFUL CARNIVORES. THERE ARE AT LEAST 20 FAMILIES AND ABOUT 500 GENERA AND 3 400 SPECIES.
THEY HAVE A LONG SLENDER BODY AND ARE VERY MOBILE IN THEIR OWN WAY. MOST OF THEM LIVE IN THE TROPICS. VERY FEW SNAKE SPECIES LIVE BEYOND THE TROPIC OF CANCER OR TROPIC OF CAPRICORN AND ONLY ONE SPECIES THE COMMON VIPER VIPERA BERUS LIVES BEYOND THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. THEIR SKIN IS COVERED WITH SCALES. THEY CAN SEE WELL ENOUGH AND THEY CAN TASTE SCENTS WITH THEIR TONGUES BY FLICKING THEM IN AND OUT. THEY ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO VIBRATIONS IN THE GROUND.
THOUGH THEY DO NOT HAVE A VOICE THEY CAN HISS. MOST SNAKES LIVE ON THE GROUND OTHERS LIVE IN THE WATER AND A FEW LIVE UNDER THE SOIL. LIKE ALL REPTILES SNAKES NEED THE HEAT OF THE SUN TO CONTROL THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE. THAT IS WHY MOST SNAKES ARE IN THE WARM HUMID TROPICAL REGIONS OF THE WORLD.
THEY RANGE IN SIZE FROM THE TINY 10.4 CM 4 INCH LONG THREAD SNAKE TO THE RETICULATED PYTHON OF IN LENGTH. THE FOSSIL TITANOBOA WAS LONG.
SNAKES ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE EVOLVED FROM LIZARDS. THE EARLIEST SNAKE FOSSILS ARE FROM THE LOWER CRETACEOUS. A WIDE RANGE OF SNAKES APPEARED DURING THE PALEOCENE PERIOD C 66 TO 56 MILLION YEARS AGO.
THE SQUAMATA ARE DEFINITELY A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP IT IS A SISTER GROUP TO THE TUATARA. JUDGED BY THEIR FOSSIL RECORD THE SQUAMATES WERE PRESENT IN THE MESOZOIC BUT HAD A MINOR PLACE IN THE LAND ECOLOGY. THREE OF THE SIX LINES ARE RECORDED FIRST IN THE UPPER JURASSIC THE OTHERS IN THE CRETACEOUS. PROBABLY ALL CERTAINLY THE LIZARDS AROSE EARLIER IN THE JURASSIC. THE MOSASAURS OF THE UPPER CRETACEOUS WERE BY FAR THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF ALL THE LIZARDS BECOMING THE TOP PREDATOR IN THEIR ECOSYSTEM.
ALTHOUGH SNAKES AND LIZARDS LOOK VERY DIFFERENT NEITHER IS A PROPER CLADE. SNAKES DID DESCEND FROM EARLY LIZARDS NOT ONCE BUT A NUMBER OF TIMES. 
THERE IS A MONOPHYLETIC CLADE WITHIN THE SQUAMATA. IT IS THE TOXICOFERA. IT INCLUDES ALL VENOMOUS SNAKES AND LIZARDS AND MANY RELATED NON VENOMOUS SPECIES. THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS IS IN RECENT MOLECULAR ANALYSES.
THE FOSSIL OF A PRIMITIVE SNAKE FROM THE LOWER CRETACEOUS HAS BEEN FOUND. IT LIVED ABOUT 113 MILLION YEARS AGO. IT HAD RATHER SMALL FRONT AND REAR LEGS. SEVERAL OTHER FOSSIL SNAKES HAVE BEEN FOUND WITH SMALL REAR LEGS BUT THIS IS THE FIRST ONE WITH ALL FOUR LEGS. THE SNAKE TETRAPODOPHIS AMPLECTUS LIVED ON LAND AND WAS ADAPTED TO BURROWING. THE RESEARCHER SAID THERE WERE A LOT OF VERY ADVANCED SNAKE FEATURES INCLUDING ITS HOOKED TEETH FLEXIBLE JAW AND SPINE AND EVEN SNAKE LIKE SCALES. AND THERE S THE GUT CONTENTS IT S SWALLOWED ANOTHER VERTEBRATE. IT WAS PREYING ON OTHER ANIMALS WHICH IS A SNAKE FEATURE. THE SNAKE CAME FROM THE CRATO FORMATION IN BRAZIL AND LAY IN A PRIVATE COLLECTION FOR MANY YEARS. IT WAS RE DISCOVERED IN A MUSEUM AT SOLNHOFEN BAVARIA. 
MOST SNAKES ARE NONVENOMOUS. THOSE THAT HAVE VENOM USE IT MAINLY TO KILL AND SUBDUE PREY RATHER THAN FOR SELF DEFENSE. SOME HAVE VENOM POTENT ENOUGH TO CAUSE PAINFUL INJURY OR DEATH TO HUMANS. NONVENOMOUS SNAKES EITHER SWALLOW PREY ALIVE OR KILL BY SQUEEZING.
TWO TAXONOMIC FAMILIES ARE ENTIRELY VENOMOUS 
A THIRD FAMILY WITH THE REAR FANGED SNAKES AND MOST OF THE OTHER SNAKE SPECIES IS THE
MANY SNAKES HAVE SKULLS WITH MORE JOINTS THAN THEIR LIZARD ANCESTORS. THIS HELPS THEM SWALLOW PREY MUCH LARGER THAN THEIR HEADS. THE BONES OF THE HEAD AND JAWS CAN MOVE APART TO LET LARGE PREY MOVE INTO THEIR BODY. THE THROAT STOMACH AND INTESTINES CAN ALSO EXPAND IN A MOST EXTRAORDINARY MANNER. IN THIS WAS A THIN LOOKING SNAKE CAN SWALLOW AND DIGEST A LARGER ANIMAL.
TO FIT THEIR NARROW BODIES SNAKES PAIRED ORGANS SUCH AS KIDNEYS ARE ONE IN FRONT OF THE OTHER INSTEAD OF SIDE BY SIDE AND MOST SNAKES HAVE ONLY ONE WORKING LUNG. SOME SPECIES HAVE A PELVIC GIRDLE WITH A PAIR OF VESTIGIAL CLAWS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CLOACA. THIS IS A RELIC OF THE LEGS WHICH DO NOT APPEAR IN MODERN SNAKES.
SNAKES NEED TO SHED THEIR SKIN REGULARLY WHILE THEY GROW. THIS IS CALLED MOULTING. SNAKES SHED THEIR SKIN BY RUBBING THEIR HEAD AGAINST SOMETHING ROUGH AND HARD LIKE A PIECE OF WOOD OR A ROCK. THIS CAUSES THE SKIN WHICH IS ALREADY STRETCHED TO SPLIT OPEN. THE SNAKE KEEPS ON RUBBING ITS SKIN ON VARIOUS ROUGH OBJECTS UNTIL THE SKIN PEELS OFF FROM ITS HEAD. THIS LETS IT CRAWL OUT TURNING THE SKIN INSIDE OUT.
ALL SNAKES ARE CARNIVOROUS THEY EAT OTHER ANIMALS. SOME ARE VENOMOUS THEY INJECT POISON BY GROOVES IN THEIR TEETH. CONSTRICTORS ARE NOT VENOMOUS SO THEY SQUEEZE THEIR PREY TO DEATH. SNAKES SWALLOW THEIR FOOD WHOLE AND THEY CANNOT CHEW. BECAUSE THEY ARE COLD BLOODED THEY DO NOT HAVE TO EAT SO REGULARLY AS MAMMALS. PEOPLE WHO OWN PET SNAKES FEED THEM AS INFREQUENTLY AS ONCE PER MONTH. SOME SNAKES CAN GO AS LONG AS SIX MONTHS WITHOUT A GOOD MEAL.
THE LACK OF LIMBS DOES NOT IMPEDE THE MOVEMENT OF SNAKES. THEY HAVE DEVELOPED SEVERAL DIFFERENT MODES OF LOCOMOTION TO DEAL WITH PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENTS. EACH MODE OF SNAKE LOCOMOTION IS DISCRETE AND DISTINCT FROM THE OTHERS.
LATERAL UNDULATION IS THE SOLE MODE OF AQUATIC LOCOMOTION AND THE MOST COMMON MODE OF TERRESTRIAL LOCOMOTION. IN THIS MODE THE BODY OF THE SNAKE ALTERNATELY FLEXES TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT RESULTING IN A SERIES OF REARWARD MOVING WAVES. WHILE THIS MOVEMENT APPEARS RAPID SNAKES HAVE RARELY BEEN DOCUMENTED MOVING FASTER THAN TWO BODY LENGTHS PER SECOND OFTEN MUCH LESS. THIS MODE OF MOVEMENT HAS THE SAME NET COST OF TRANSPORT CALORIES BURNED PER METER MOVED AS RUNNING IN LIZARDS OF THE SAME MASS.
TERRESTRIAL LATERAL UNDULATION IS THE MOST COMMON MODE OF TERRESTRIAL LOCOMOTION FOR MOST SNAKE SPECIES. IN THIS MODE THE POSTERIORLY MOVING WAVES PUSH AGAINST CONTACT POINTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS ROCKS TWIGS IRREGULARITIES IN THE SOIL ETC. EACH OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTS IN TURN GENERATES A REACTION FORCE DIRECTED FORWARD AND TOWARDS THE MIDLINE OF THE SNAKE RESULTING IN FORWARD THRUST WHILE THE LATERAL COMPONENTS CANCEL OUT. THE SPEED OF THIS MOVEMENT DEPENDS UPON THE DENSITY OF PUSH POINTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT WITH A MEDIUM DENSITY OF ABOUT 8 ALONG THE SNAKE S LENGTH BEING IDEAL. THE WAVE SPEED IS PRECISELY THE SAME AS THE SNAKE SPEED AND AS A RESULT EVERY POINT ON THE SNAKE S BODY FOLLOWS THE PATH OF THE POINT AHEAD OF IT ALLOWING SNAKES TO MOVE THROUGH VERY DENSE VEGETATION AND SMALL OPENINGS.
SNAKES MOVE FORWARD IN WATER BY MOVING THEIR BODIES IN A WAVE LIKE MOTION. THE WAVES BECOME LARGER AS THEY MOVE DOWN THE SNAKE S BODY AND THE WAVE TRAVELS BACKWARDS FASTER THAN THE SNAKE MOVES FORWARDS. THRUST IS GOT BY PUSHING THEIR BODY AGAINST THE WATER THIS RESULTS IN THE OBSERVED SLIP. IN SPITE OF OVERALL SIMILARITIES STUDIES SHOW THAT THE PATTERN OF MUSCLE ACTIVATION IS DIFFERENT IN AQUATIC VERSUS TERRESTRIAL LATERAL UNDULATION WHICH JUSTIFIES CALLING THEM SEPARATE MODES. ALL SNAKES CAN LATERALLY UNDULATE FORWARD WITH BACKWARD MOVING WAVES BUT ONLY SEA SNAKES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED REVERSING THE MOTION MOVING BACKWARDS WITH FORWARD MOVING WAVES.
THIS IS MOST OFTEN USED BY COLUBROID SNAKES COLUBRIDS ELAPIDS AND VIPERS. THEY USE IT WHEN THE ENVIRONMENT LACKS ANYTHING FIRM TO PUSH AGAINST SUCH AS A SLICK MUD FLAT OR A SAND DUNE. SIDEWINDING IS A MODIFIED FORM OF LATERAL UNDULATION IN WHICH ALL OF THE BODY SEGMENTS ORIENTED IN ONE DIRECTION REMAIN IN CONTACT WITH THE GROUND WHILE THE OTHER SEGMENTS ARE LIFTED UP. THIS RESULTS IN A PECULIAR ROLLING MOTION. THIS MODE OF LOCOMOTION OVERCOMES THE SLIPPERY NATURE OF SAND OR MUD BY PUSHING OFF WITH ONLY STATIC PORTIONS ON THE BODY THEREBY MINIMIZING SLIPPING. THE STATIC NATURE OF THE CONTACT POINTS CAN BE SHOWN FROM THE TRACKS OF A SIDEWINDING SNAKE WHICH SHOW EACH BELLY SCALE IMPRINT WITHOUT ANY SMEARING. THIS MODE OF LOCOMOTION HAS VERY LOW CALORIC COST LESS THAN OF THE COST FOR A LIZARD OR SNAKE TO MOVE THE SAME DISTANCE.
WHEN PUSH POINTS ARE ABSENT BUT THE SPACE IS TOO NARROW FOR SIDEWINDING SUCH AS IN TUNNELS SNAKES RELY ON CONCERTINA LOCOMOTION. IN THIS MODE THE SNAKE BRACES THE BACK PART OF ITS BODY AGAINST THE TUNNEL WALL WHILE THE FRONT OF THE SNAKE EXTENDS AND STRAIGHTENS. THE FRONT PORTION THEN FLEXES AND FORMS AN ANCHOR POINT AND THE BACK PART IS STRAIGHTENED AND PULLED FORWARDS. THIS MODE OF LOCOMOTION IS SLOW AND VERY DEMANDING NEEDING UP TO SEVEN TIMES THE ENERGY OF LATERALLY UNDULATING OVER THE SAME DISTANCE. THIS HIGH COST IS DUE TO THE REPEATED STOPS AND STARTS OF PORTIONS OF THE BODY AS WELL AS THE NEED TO USE THE MUSCLES TO BRACE AGAINST THE TUNNEL WALLS.
THE SLOWEST MODE OF SNAKE LOCOMOTION IS RECTILINEAR LOCOMOTION WHICH IS ALSO THE ONLY ONE WHERE THE SNAKE DOES NOT NEED TO BEND ITS BODY LATERALLY THOUGH IT MAY DO SO WHEN TURNING. IN THIS MODE THE BELLY SCALES ARE LIFTED AND PULLED FORWARD BEFORE BEING PLACED DOWN AND THE BODY PULLED OVER THEM. WAVES OF MOVEMENT AND STASIS PASS POSTERIORLY RESULTING IN A SERIES OF RIPPLES IN THE SKIN. THE RIBS OF THE SNAKE DO NOT MOVE IN THIS MODE OF LOCOMOTION AND THIS METHOD IS MOST OFTEN USED BY LARGE PYTHONS BOAS AND VIPERS WHEN STALKING PREY ACROSS OPEN GROUND AS THE SNAKE S MOVEMENTS ARE SUBTLE AND HARDER TO DETECT BY THEIR PREY IN THIS MANNER.
THE MOVEMENT OF SNAKES IN TREES HAS ONLY RECENTLY BEEN STUDIED. WHILE ON TREE BRANCHES SNAKES USE SEVERAL MODES OF LOCOMOTION DEPENDING ON SPECIES AND BARK TEXTURE. IN GENERAL SNAKES WILL USE A MODIFIED FORM OF CONCERTINA LOCOMOTION ON SMOOTH BRANCHES BUT WILL LATERALLY UNDULATE IF CONTACT POINTS ARE AVAILABLE. SNAKES MOVE FASTER ON SMALL BRANCHES AND WHEN CONTACT POINTS ARE PRESENT IN CONTRAST TO LIMBED ANIMALS WHICH DO BETTER ON LARGE BRANCHES WITH LITTLE CLUTTER.
GLIDING SNAKES CHRYSOPELEA OF SOUTHEAST ASIA LAUNCH THEMSELVES FROM BRANCH TIPS SPREADING THEIR RIBS AND LATERALLY UNDULATING AS THEY GLIDE BETWEEN TREES. THESE SNAKES CAN PERFORM A CONTROLLED GLIDE FOR HUNDREDS OF FEET DEPENDING UPON LAUNCH ALTITUDE AND CAN EVEN TURN IN MIDAIR.
SOLAR SYSTEM
THE SOLAR SYSTEM IS THE SUN AND ALL THE OBJECTS THAT ORBIT AROUND IT. THE SUN IS ORBITED BY PLANETS ASTEROIDS COMETS AND OTHER THINGS. IT IS BILLIONS OF YEARS OLD.
THE SUN IS A STAR. IT CONTAINS 99.9 PERCENT OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM S MASS. THIS MEANS THAT IT HAS STRONG GRAVITY. THE OTHER OBJECTS ARE PULLED INTO ORBIT AROUND THE SUN. THE SUN IS MOSTLY MADE OUT OF HYDROGEN AND HELIUM.
THERE ARE EIGHT PLANETS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. FROM CLOSEST TO FARTHEST FROM THE SUN THEY ARE MERCURY VENUS EARTH MARS JUPITER SATURN URANUS AND NEPTUNE. THE FIRST FOUR PLANETS ARE CALLED TERRESTRIAL PLANETS. THEY ARE MOSTLY MADE OF ROCK AND METAL AND THEY ARE MOSTLY SOLID. THE LAST FOUR PLANETS ARE CALLED GAS GIANTS. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE MUCH LARGER THAN OTHER PLANETS AND ARE MOSTLY MADE OF GAS. 
THE SOLAR SYSTEM ALSO CONTAINS OTHER THINGS. THERE ARE ASTEROIDS MOSTLY BETWEEN MARS AND JUPITER. FURTHER OUT THAN NEPTUNE THERE IS THE KUIPER BELT AND THE SCATTERED DISC. THESE AREAS HAVE DWARF PLANETS INCLUDING PLUTO. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF VERY SMALL OBJECTS IN THESE AREAS. THERE ARE ALSO COMETS CENTAURS AND THERE IS INTERPLANETARY DUST.
SIX OF THE PLANETS AND THREE OF THE DWARF PLANETS ARE ORBITED BY MOONS. FURTHERMORE PLANETARY DUST ORBITS THE GAS GIANTS. MANY OTHER SYSTEMS LIKE THE SOLAR SYSTEM HAVE BEEN FOUND. EACH OF THE BILLIONS OF STARS IN THE MILKY WAY GALAXY MIGHT HAVE A PLANETARY SYSTEM.
THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM BEGAN 4.6 BILLION YEARS AGO WITH THE GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF A SMALL PART OF A GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUD.
MOST OF THE COLLAPSING MASS COLLECTED IN THE CENTRE FORMING THE SUN WHILE THE REST FLATTENED INTO A PROTOPLANETARY DISK OF LOOSE DUST OUT OF WHICH THE PLANETS MOONS ASTEROIDS AND OTHER SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES FORMED.
THIS WIDELY ACCEPTED MODEL KNOWN AS THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS WAS FIRST DEVELOPED IN THE 18TH 1700 S CENTURY BY EMANUEL SWEDENBORG IMMANUEL KANT AND PIERRE SIMON LAPLACE. ITS SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT HAS INTERWOVEN A VARIETY OF SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES INCLUDING ASTRONOMY PHYSICS GEOLOGY AND PLANETARY SCIENCE. AS OUR KNOWLEDGE OF SPACE HAS GROWN THE MODELS HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NEW OBSERVATIONS.
THE SOLAR SYSTEM HAS EVOLVED CONSIDERABLY SINCE ITS INITIAL FORMATION. MANY MOONS HAVE FORMED FROM CIRCLING DISCS OF GAS AND DUST AROUND THEIR PARENT PLANETS WHILE OTHER MOONS ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE FORMED INDEPENDENTLY AND LATER BEEN CAPTURED BY THEIR PLANETS. STILL OTHERS AS THE EARTH S MOON MAY BE THE RESULT OF GIANT COLLISIONS. 
MANY COLLISIONS BETWEEN BODIES HAVE OCCURRED AND HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT TO THE EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THE POSITIONS OF THE PLANETS OFTEN SHIFTED AND PLANETS HAVE SWITCHED PLACES. THIS PLANETARY MIGRATION IS THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM S EARLY EVOLUTION.
THE EARTH S ORBIT AROUND THE SUN IS NEARLY A PERFECT CIRCLE BUT WHEN MAPPED IT IS FOUND THAT THE EARTH MOVES AROUND THE SUN IN A VERY SLIGHTLY OVAL SHAPED CALLED AN ELLIPTICAL ORBIT. THE OTHER PLANETS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM ALSO CIRCLE THE SUN IN SLIGHTLY ELLIPTICAL ORBITS. MERCURY HAS A MORE ELLIPTICAL ORBIT THAN THE OTHERS AND SOME OF THE SMALLER OBJECTS ORBIT THE SUN IN VERY ECCENTRIC ORBITS.
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS PEOPLE HAD NO NEED FOR A NAME FOR THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THEY THOUGHT THE EARTH STAYED STILL AT THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING GEOCENTRISM. ALTHOUGH THE GREEK PHILOSOPHER ARISTARCHUS OF SAMOS SUGGESTED THAT THERE WAS A SPECIAL ORDER IN THE SKY NICOLAUS COPERNICUS WAS THE FIRST TO DEVELOP A MATHEMATICAL SYSTEM THAT DESCRIBED WHAT WE NOW CALL THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THIS WAS CALLED A NEW SYSTEM OF THE WORLD. IN THE 17TH CENTURY GALILEO GALILEI JOHANNES KEPLER AND ISAAC NEWTON BEGAN HELPING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND PHYSICS MORE CLEARLY. PEOPLE BEGAN TO ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT THE EARTH IS A PLANET AND MOVES AROUND THE SUN AND THAT THE PLANETS ARE WORLDS WITH THE SAME PHYSICAL LAWS THAT CONTROL EARTH. MORE RECENTLY TELESCOPES AND SPACE PROBES HAVE LED TO DISCOVERIES OF MOUNTAINS AND CRATERS AND SEASONAL METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA SUCH AS CLOUDS DUST STORMS AND ICE CAPS ON THE OTHER PLANETS.
IN THEIR ORDER FROM THE SUN 
THE PLANETS ARE THE BIGGEST OBJECTS THAT GO AROUND SUN. IT TOOK PEOPLE MANY YEARS OF USING TELESCOPES TO FIND THE OBJECTS THAT WERE FARTHEST AWAY. NEW PLANETS MIGHT STILL BE FOUND AND MORE SMALL OBJECTS ARE FOUND EVERY YEAR. MOST OF THE PLANETS HAVE MOONS THAT ORBIT AROUND THEM JUST AS THE PLANETS ORBIT THE SUN. THERE ARE AT LEAST 173 OF THESE MOONS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM.
PLUTO HAD BEEN CALLED A PLANET SINCE IT WAS DISCOVERED IN 1930 BUT IN 2006 ASTRONOMERS MEETING AT THE INTERNATIONAL ASTRONOMICAL UNION DECIDED ON THE DEFINITION OF A PLANET AND PLUTO DID NOT FIT. INSTEAD THEY DEFINED A NEW CATEGORY OF DWARF PLANET INTO WHICH PLUTO DID FIT ALONG WITH SOME OTHERS. THESE SMALL PLANETS ARE SOMETIMES CALLED PLUTINOS.
THERE ARE A FEW MAIN PARTS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. HERE THEY ARE IN ORDER FROM THE SUN WITH THE PLANETS NUMBERED AND THE DWARF PLANETS MARKED WITH THE LETTERS A E.
THE FIRST FOUR PLANETS CLOSEST TO THE SUN ARE CALLED THE INNER PLANETS. THEY ARE SMALL AND DENSE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS WITH SOLID SURFACES. THEY ARE MADE UP OF MOSTLY ROCK AND METAL WITH A DISTINCT INTERNAL STRUCTURE AND A SIMILAR SIZE. THREE ALSO HAVE AN ATMOSPHERE. THE STUDY OF THE FOUR PLANETS GIVES INFORMATION ABOUT GEOLOGY OUTSIDE THE EARTH. MOST ASTEROIDS ARE ALSO OFTEN COUNTED WITH THE INNER PLANETS
THE OORT CLOUD IS SEPARATE FROM THE TRANS NEPTUNE REGION AND MUCH FARTHER OUT. IT CONTAINS THE LONG PERIOD COMETS.
THE PLANE OF THE ECLIPTIC IS DEFINED BY THE EARTH S ORBIT AROUND THE SUN. ALL OF THE PLANETS ORBIT THE SUN ROUGHLY AROUND THIS SAME ORBITAL PLANE. THE FARTHER AWAY FROM THIS PLANE A PLANET ORBITS THE MORE INCLINED IS ITS ORBIT TO THE ECLIPTIC. IF YOU COULD LOOK AT THE SOLAR SYSTEM EDGE ON THEN ALL THE PLANETS WOULD BE ORBITING MORE OR LESS IN THE PLANE OF THE ECLIPTIC.
SOVIET UNION
THE SOVIET UNION SHORT FOR UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS OR USSR WAS A SINGLE PARTY MARXIST LENINIST STATE. IT EXISTED FROM 1922 UNTIL 1991 AND WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY TO DECLARE ITSELF SOCIALIST AND BUILD TOWARDS A COMMUNIST SOCIETY. IT WAS A UNION OF 14 SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS AND 1 SOVIET FEDERATIVE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC RUSSIA.
THE SOVIET UNION WAS CREATED AFTER VLADIMIR LENIN LED THE OVERTHROW OF ALEXANDER KERENSKY. THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT DEVELOPED INDUSTRY AND OVER TIME BECAME A MAJOR POWERFUL UNION. THE LARGEST COUNTRY IN THE UNION WAS RUSSIA AND KAZAKHSTAN WAS THE SECOND. THE CAPITAL CITY OF THE SOVIET UNION WAS MOSCOW. ALTHOUGH THE CONSTITUTION SAID THE REPUBLICS COULD LEAVE THE UNION IF THEY WANTED IN PRACTICE IT WAS A COMPLETELY CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT WITH NO STATES RIGHTS FOR THE MEMBER COUNTRIES. MANY BELIEVE THAT THE SOVIET UNION WAS THE FINAL STAGE OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE SINCE THE USSR COVERED MOST OF THE LAND OF THE FORMER EMPIRE.
THE UNION WAS FORMED WITH THE PROFESSED IDEA TO GIVE EVERYONE EQUAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS. THERE WAS VIRTUALLY NO PRIVATE PROPERTY EVERYTHING BELONGED TO THE STATE. SOVIETS OR WORKERS COUNCILS WERE CREATED TO SPEAK FOR THE WORKERS AND SERVED AS AN ELITE GROUP TO GOVERN THEM. IT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN MANY FIELDS PUTTING THE FIRST MAN AND SATELLITE INTO SPACE AND WINNING WORLD WAR II ALONGSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND UNITED KINGDOM. HOWEVER ITS CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT FOUND INNOVATION AND CHANGE DIFFICULT TO HANDLE. THE UNION COLLAPSED IN 1991 PARTLY DUE TO THE EFFORTS AT REFORM BY ITS LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV.
FROM 2016 THE DOCUMENT THAT CONFIRMED THE DISSOLUTION OF THE SOVIET UNION IS MISSING.
THE SOVIET UNION WAS MADE OF 15 REPUBLICS. THESE WERE EITHER SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS OR SOVIET SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLICS. EACH OF THESE REPUBLICS WAS INDEPENDENT. IT ALSO HAD THE RIGHT TO LEAVE THE UNION WHICH THEY DID IN 1991.
THE FEDERAL REPUBLICS WERE DIFFERENT IN THAT THEY HAD MORE AUTONOMY AND WERE MADE UP OF STATES THEMSELVES. THESE WERE OFTEN CALLED AUTONOMOUS SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THEM. MOST OF THEM STILL EXIST THOUGH THEY ARE NOW REPUBLICS WITHIN THE INDEPENDENT STATE. THE TATAR ASSR TURNED INTO THE REPUBLIC OF TATARSTAN FOR EXAMPLE IT IS LOCATED AROUND KAZAN.
THE SOVIET UNION AT ITS LARGEST SIZE IN 1991 WITH WAS THE WORLD S BIGGEST COUNTRY. COVERING A SIXTH OF THE WORLD S LIVED IN LAND ITS SIZE WAS COMPARABLE TO NORTH AMERICA S. THE WESTERN PART IN EUROPE ACCOUNTED FOR A QUARTER OF THE COUNTRY S AREA AND WAS THE COUNTRY S CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC CENTER. THE EASTERN PART IN ASIA EXTENDED TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN TO THE EAST AND AFGHANISTAN TO THE SOUTH AND WAS MUCH LESS LIVED IN THAN THE WESTERN PART. IT WAS OVER ACROSS 11 TIME ZONES AND ALMOST NORTH TO SOUTH. ITS FIVE CLIMATIC DIFFERENT WEATHER TEMPERATURE HUMIDITY AND ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE ZONES WERE TUNDRA TAIGA STEPPES DESERT AND MOUNTAINS.
THE SOVIET UNION HAD THE WORLD S LONGEST BORDER MEASURING OVER IN 1991. TWO THIRDS OF THE SOVIET BORDER WAS COASTLINE OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN. ACROSS THE BERING STRAIT WAS THE UNITED STATES. THE SOVIET UNION BORDERED AFGHANISTAN CHINA CZECHOSLOVAKIA FINLAND HUNGARY IRAN MONGOLIA NORTH KOREA NORWAY POLAND ROMANIA AND TURKEY AT THE END OF WWII.
THE SOVIET UNION S LONGEST RIVER WAS THE IRTYSH. THE SOVIET UNION S HIGHEST MOUNTAIN WAS COMMUNISM PEAK TODAY IT IS CALLED THE ISMAIL SAMANI PEAK IN TAJIKISTAN MEASURED AT. THE WORLD S LARGEST LAKE THE CASPIAN SEA WAS MOSTLY IN THE SOVIET UNION. THE WORLD S DEEPEST LAKE LAKE BAIKAL WAS IN THE SOVIET UNION.
THE LAST RUSSIAN TSAR TRANSLATED CAESAR WHICH MEANS EMPEROR NICHOLAS II RULED RUSSIA UNTIL MARCH 1917 WHEN THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE WAS TAKEN OVER AND A SHORT LIVED PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT REPLACED IT LED BY ALEXANDER KERENSKY AND SOON TO BE OVERTHROWN IN NOVEMBER BY BOLSHEVIKS.
FROM 1917 TO 1922 THE COUNTRY THAT CAME BEFORE THE SOVIET UNION WAS THE RUSSIAN SOVIET FEDERATIVE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC RSFSR WHICH WAS ITS OWN COUNTRY AS WERE OTHER SOVIET REPUBLICS AT THE TIME. THE SOVIET UNION WAS OFFICIALLY CREATED IN DECEMBER 1922 AS THE UNION OF THE RUSSIAN ALSO KNOWN AS BOLSHEVIST RUSSIA UKRAINIAN BELARUSIAN AND TRANSCAUCASIAN SOVIET REPUBLICS RULED BY THE COMMUNIST BOLSHEVIK PARTIES.
EXTREME GOVERNMENT CHANGING ACTIVITY IN THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE BEGAN WITH THE DECEMBRIST REVOLT OF 1825 AND ALTHOUGH SERFDOM WAS REMOVED IN 1861 ITS REMOVAL WAS ACHIEVED ON TERMS UNFAVORABLE TO THE PEASANTS POOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS AND SERVED TO ENCOURAGE CHANGERS REVOLUTIONARIES. A PARLIAMENT LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY THE STATE DUMA WAS CREATED IN 1906 AFTER THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION OF 1905 BUT THE TSAR PROTESTED PEOPLE TRYING TO MOVE FROM ABSOLUTE TO CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY. REBELLION CONTINUED AND WAS AGGRAVATED DURING WORLD WAR I BY FAILURE AND FOOD SHORTAGES IN POPULAR CITIES.
A REBELLION IN SAINT PETERSBURG IN RESPONSE TO THE WARTIME DECAY OF RUSSIA S ECONOMY AND MORALE CAUSED THE FEBRUARY REVOLUTION AND THE REMOVAL OF THE GOVERNMENT IN MARCH 1917. THE TSARIST AUTOCRACY WAS REPLACED BY THE RUSSIAN PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WHOSE LEADERS INTENDED TO HAVE ELECTIONS TO RUSSIAN CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY AND TO CONTINUE WAR ON THE SIDE OF THE ENTENTE IN WORLD WAR I.
AT THE SAME TIME WORKERS COUNCILS KNOWN AS SOVIETS SPRANG UP ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE BOLSHEVIKS LED BY VLADIMIR LENIN PUSHED FOR SOCIALIST REVOLUTION IN THE SOVIETS AND ON THE STREETS. IN NOVEMBER 1917 DURING THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION THEY TOOK POWER FROM THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT. IN DECEMBER THE BOLSHEVIKS SIGNED AN ARMISTICE PEACE WITH THE CENTRAL POWERS. IN MARCH AFTER MORE FIGHTING THE SOVIETS QUIT THE WAR FOR GOOD AND SIGNED THE TREATY OF BREST LITOVSK.
IN THE LONG AND BLOODY RUSSIAN CIVIL WAR THE NEW SOVIET POWER WON. THE CIVIL WAR BETWEEN THE REDS AND THE WHITES STARTED IN 1917 AND ENDED IN 1923. IT INCLUDED THE SIBERIAN INTERVENTION AND OTHER FOREIGN INTERFERENCE THE KILLING OF NICHOLAS II AND HIS FAMILY AND THE FAMINE IN 1921 WHICH KILLED ABOUT 5 MILLION. IN MARCH 1921 DURING A RELATED CONFLICT WITH POLAND THE PEACE OF RIGA WAS SIGNED AND SPLIT DISPUTED TERRITORIES IN BELARUS AND UKRAINE BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND AND SOVIET RUSSIA. THE SOVIET UNION HAD TO RESOLVE SIMILAR CONFLICTS WITH THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED REPUBLIC OF FINLAND THE REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA THE REPUBLIC OF LATVIA AND THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA WHICH HAD ALL ESCAPED THE EMPIRE DURING THE CIVIL WAR.
ON 28 DECEMBER 1922 PEOPLE FROM THE RUSSIAN SFSR THE TRANSCAUCASIAN SFSR THE UKRAINIAN SSR AND THE BYELORUSSIAN SSR APPROVED THE TREATY OF CREATION OF THE USSR AND THE DECLARATION OF THE CREATION OF THE USSR CREATING THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS. THESE TWO DOCUMENTS WERE MADE TRUE BY THE 1ST CONGRESS OF SOVIETS OF THE USSR AND SIGNED BY HEADS OF DELEGATIONS.
ON 1 FEBRUARY 1924 THE USSR WAS ACCEPTED AS A COUNTRY BY THE BRITISH EMPIRE. ALSO IN 1924 A SOVIET CONSTITUTION SET OF LAWS WAS APPROVED MAKING TRUE THE DECEMBER 1922 UNION OF THE RUSSIAN SFSR THE UKRAINIAN SSR THE BELARUSIAN SSR AND THE TRANSCAUCASIAN SFSR TO FORM THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS USSR.
THE BIG CHANGES OF THE ECONOMY INDUSTRY AND POLITICS OF THE COUNTRY BEGAN IN THE EARLY DAYS OF SOVIET POWER IN 1917. A LARGE PART OF THIS WAS PERFORMED ACCORDING TO BOLSHEVIK INITIAL DECREES DOCUMENTS OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT SIGNED BY VLADIMIR LENIN. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND NOTABLE BREAKTHROUGHS WAS THE GOELRO PLAN THAT PLANNED A MAJOR CHANGE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY BASED ON TOTAL ELECTRIFICATION OF THE COUNTRY. THE PLAN WAS DEVELOPED IN 1920 AND COVERED A 10 TO 15 YEAR PERIOD. IT INCLUDED THE MAKING OF A NETWORK OF 30 REGIONAL POWER STATIONS INCLUDING TEN LARGE HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS AND NUMEROUS ELECTRIC POWERED LARGE INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE PLAN BECAME THE PROTOTYPE FOR SUBSEQUENT FIVE YEAR PLANS AND WAS BASICALLY FULFILLED BY 1931.
FROM ITS BEGINNING YEARS GOVERNMENT IN THE SOVIET UNION WAS RULED AS A ONE PARTY STATE BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY BOLSHEVIKS. AFTER THE ECONOMIC POLICY OF WAR COMMUNISM DURING THE CIVIL WAR THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT PERMITTED SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE TO COEXIST WITH NATIONALIZED INDUSTRY IN THE 1920S AND TOTAL FOOD REQUISITION IN THE COUNTRYSIDE WAS REPLACED BY A FOOD TAX SEE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY.
SOVIET LEADERS ARGUED THAT ONE PARTY RULE WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT ENSURED THAT CAPITALIST EXPLOITATION WOULD NOT RETURN TO THE SOVIET UNION AND THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM WOULD REPRESENT THE PEOPLE S WILL. DEBATE OVER THE FUTURE OF THE ECONOMY PROVIDED THE BACKGROUND FOR SOVIET LEADERS TO TAKE MORE POWER IN THE YEARS AFTER LENIN S DEATH IN 1924. INITIALLY LENIN WAS TO BE REPLACED BY A TROIKA COMPOSED OF GRIGORY ZINOVIEV OF UKRAINE LEV KAMENEV OF MOSCOW AND JOSEPH STALIN OF GEORGIA.
STALIN LED THE COUNTRY THROUGH WORLD WAR II AND INTO THE COLD WAR. GULAG CAMPS GREATLY EXPANDED TO TAKE MILLIONS OF PRISONERS. AFTER HE DIED GEORGY MALENKOV ONE OF THE FEW TOP OFFICIALS HE DIDN T KILL CONTINUED HIS POLICIES. NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV REVERSED SOME OF STALIN S POLICIES BUT LEONID BREZHNEV AND ALEXEI KOSYGIN KEPT THINGS AS THEY WERE.
AFTER THE 1936 REVISED CONSTITUTION THE SOVIET UNION STOPPED ACTING AS A UNION OF REPUBLICS AND MORE AS A SINGLE SUPER COUNTRY.
LEONID BREZHNEV LED THE SOVIET UNION FROM 1964 UNTIL HIS DEATH IN 1982. HE CAME TO POWER AFTER HE CONVINCED THE GOVERNMENT TO OVERTHROW THE THEN LEADER NIKITA KRUSHCHEV. BREZHNEV S RULE IS OFTEN LINKED WITH THE DECLINE IN SOVIET ECONOMY AND STARTING THE CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE UNION S EVENTUAL COLLAPSE. HE HAD MANY SELF AWARDED MEDALS. HE WAS AWARDED HERO OF THE SOVIET UNION THE HIGHEST HONOR ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS. BREZHNEV WAS SUCCEEDED BY YURI ANDROPOV WHO DIED A FEW YEARS LATER. ANDROPOV WAS SUCCEEDED BY THE FRAIL AND AGING KONSTANTIN CHERNENKO. CHERNENKO DIED A MERE YEAR AFTER TAKING OFFICE.
IN 1980 THE SOVIET UNION HOSTED THE SUMMER OLYMPICS WITH BREZHNEV OPENING AND CLOSING THE GAMES. THE GAMES WERE HEAVILY BOYCOTTED BY THE WESTERN NATIONS PARTICULARLY THE UNITED STATES. DURING THE CLOSING CEREMONY THE FLAG OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WAS RAISED INSTEAD OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES TO SYMBOLISE THE NEXT HOST CITY NATION AND THE ANTHEM OF THE OLYMPICS WAS PLAYED INSTEAD OF THE ANTHEM OF THE UNITED STATES IN RESPONSE TO THE BOYCOTT.
BREZHNEV WAS THE SECOND LONGEST SERVING SOVIET LEADER AFTER STALIN. THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF LEADERS GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN ORDER OF THEIR TENURE AND LENGTH OF LEADERSHIP 
KHRUSHCHEV AND GORBACHEV ARE THE ONLY SOVIET LEADERS TO HAVE NOT DIED WHILST IN OFFICE. LENIN STALIN AND KHRUSHCHEV ARE THE ONLY LEADERS WHO WERE NOT DE JURE HEAD OF STATE DURING THEIR LEADERSHIPS.
MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS THE SOVIET UNION S LAST LEADER. HE WAS THE ONLY SOVIET LEADER TO HAVE BEEN BORN AFTER THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND WAS THUS A PRODUCT OF THE SOVIET UNION HAVING GROWN UP IN IT. HE AND US PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN SIGNED A TREATY TO GET RID OF SOME NUCLEAR WEAPONS. GORBACHEV STARTED SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS THAT GAVE PEOPLE FREEDOM OF SPEECH WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO CRITICISE THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS POLICIES. THE RULING COMMUNIST PARTY LOST ITS GRIP ON THE MEDIA AND THE PEOPLE. NEWSPAPERS BEGAN PRINTING THE MANY FAILURES THAT THE SOVIET UNION HAD COVERED UP AND DENIED IN ITS PAST. THE SOVIET UNION S ECONOMY WAS LAGGING AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON COMPETING WITH THE WEST.
BY THE 1980S THE SOVIET ECONOMY WAS SUFFERING BUT IT WAS STABLE. GORBACHEV S NEW IDEAS HAD GOT OUT OF HAND AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY LOST CONTROL. BORIS YELTSIN WAS ELECTED DEMOCRATICALLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUSSIAN SFSR EVEN THOUGH GORBACHEV DID NOT WANT HIM TO COME INTO POWER. LITHUANIA ANNOUNCED ITS INDEPENDENCE FROM THE UNION AND THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT DEMANDED IT SURRENDER ITS INDEPENDENCE OR IT WOULD SEND THE RED ARMY TO KEEP ORDER. GORBACHEV CAME UP WITH THE IDEA TO KEEP THE SOVIET UNION TOGETHER WITH EACH REPUBLIC WOULD BE MORE INDEPENDENT BUT UNDER THE SAME LEADER. HE WANTED TO CALL IT THE UNION OF SOVIET SOVEREIGN REPUBLICS TO KEEP THE USSR SOVIET UNION TITLE AND THE CCCP IN RUSSIAN.
A GROUP OF SERIOUS COMMUNISTS UNHAPPY WITH GORBACHEV S IDEA TRIED TO TAKE OVER MOSCOW AND STOP THE SOVIET UNION FROM COLLAPSING. IT ONLY MADE PEOPLE WANT INDEPENDENCE MORE. ALTHOUGH HE SURVIVED THE ATTEMPTED TAKEOVER HE LOST ALL OF HIS POWER OUTSIDE OF MOSCOW. RUSSIA DECLARED INDEPENDENCE IN DECEMBER 1991. LATER IN THE MONTH LEADERS OF RUSSIA BYELORUSSIA AND UKRAINE SIGNED A TREATY CALLED THE BELAVEZHA AGREEMENT TO DISSOLVE THE USSR EXTREMELY ANGERING GORBACHEV. HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THE TREATY AND RESIGNED ON CHRISTMAS DAY 1991. THE SOVIET UNIONS PARLIAMENT SUPREME SOVIET MADE THE BELAVEZHA AGREEMENT LAW MARKING FORMALLY THE DISSOLUTION OF THE SOVIET UNION. THE NEXT DAY THE SOVIET FLAG WAS LOWERED FROM THE KREMLIN FOR THE LAST TIME.
SPACE SHUTTLE
THE SPACE SHUTTLE WAS A SPACECRAFT WHICH WAS USED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION OR NASA. SPACE SHUTTLES WERE USED TO CARRY ASTRONAUTS AND CARGO INTO SPACE. CARGO SUCH AS SATELLITES PARTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION OR SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS WERE TAKEN UP INTO SPACE BY THE SPACE SHUTTLE. IT WAS A UNIQUE SPACECRAFT BECAUSE IT COULD BE USED AGAIN AND AGAIN.
THE SPACE SHUTTLE WAS MADE UP OF 3 PARTS. THESE WERE THE ORBITER THE EXTERNAL FUEL TANK AND SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS. 
THE ORBITER WAS SHAPED LIKE A LARGE AIRPLANE WITH WINGS AND A TAIL. THIS ALLOWED THE SPACE SHUTTLE TO GLIDE AND LAND ON A RUNWAY. THIS ALLOWED THE REUSABLE PART OF THE SHUTTLE TO BE VERY LARGE. MANY SPACECRAFT WHICH CAME BEFORE THE SPACE SHUTTLE LIKE THE APOLLO USED PARACHUTES WHEN LANDING AND LANDED ON THE OCEAN. PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT THE SHUTTLE WAS VERY MUCH LIKE A PICKUP TRUCK BECAUSE OF ITS USEFULNESS. 
THE SHUTTLE WAS LAUNCHED OUT OF EARTH S GRAVITY AND INTO SPACE BY 3 ROCKET ENGINES ON THE BACK OF THE ORBITER ALONG WITH HELP FROM 2 LONG WHITE SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS ALSO CALLED SRBS FUEL FOR THE SHUTTLE WAS STORED IN THE LARGE USUALLY ORANGE EXTERNAL FUEL TANK ALSO CALLED ET. BEFORE THE SHUTTLE REACHED ORBIT THE SRBS WERE RELEASED AND FELL INTO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN WHERE THEY WERE TOWED BACK TO SHORE FOR REUSE. THE ET WAS ALSO RELEASED BUT BROKE UP AND FELL INTO THE INDIAN OCEAN AND WAS NOT REUSED.
THE US SPACE SHUTTLES WERE 
A NEXT TO A NAME MEANS THAT THE SHUTTLE WAS DESTROYED.
THERE WAS A RUSSIAN SHUTTLE CALLED BURAN. IT FLEW ONE UNMANNED FLIGHT BEFORE BEING RETIRED. THE BURAN WAS DESTROYED IN A HANGAR COLLAPSE IN 2002.
THE SHUTTLE WAS CREATED IN 1973. IT REPLACED THE APOLLO CAPSULES. THE FIRST FLIGHT WAS A TEST OF THE LANDING AND MANEUVERING ABILITIES OF THE SHUTTLE. THIS FLIGHT USED SPACE SHUTTLE ENTERPRISE. THE FIRST SHUTTLE FLIGHT IN SPACE WAS ON APRIL 12 1981. IT USED SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA.
ON JANUARY 28 1986 THE SPACE SHUTTLE CHALLENGER DISINTEGRATED 73 SECONDS INTO THE FLIGHT OF STS 51L. IT CAUSED A YEAR LONG STALL IN SPACE FLIGHT.
IN THE 1990S THE SHUTTLE BEGAN WORKING ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ISS. THIS WAS ITS MAIN JOB OF THE SHUTTLE SINCE THEN.
ALSO IN THE 1990S THE SPACE SHUTTLE LAUNCHED THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE INTO SPACE. SHUTTLE MISSIONS RETURNED 5 TIMES TO REPAIR AND IMPROVE CAMERAS AND SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS ON THE TELESCOPE.
ON FEBRUARY 1 2003 THE SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA BROKE UP WHILE RETURNING STS 107 TO EARTH OVER TEXAS. THE ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY DAMAGE TO THE HEAT SHIELD WHICH PROTECTS IT FROM THE HEAT OF REENTRY INTO THE EARTH S ATMOSPHERE. IT AGAIN CAUSED A LONG DELAY UNTIL THE NEXT SHUTTLE FLIGHT.
NOW ALL THE SHUTTLES HAVE RETIRED THEY MAY BE REPLACED BY THE ORION SPACECRAFT. BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT YET FUNDED THIS SPACECRAFT.
THE THREE REMAINING SHUTTLES WILL GO ON DISPLAY AT MUSEUMS. ENTERPRISE CURRENTLY AT THE STEVEN F. UDVAR HAZY CENTER IN CHANTILLY VIRGINIA WILL MOVE TO THE INTREPID SEA AIR SPACE MUSEUM IN NEW YORK CITY AND THE STEVEN F. UDVAR HAZY CENTER WILL RECEIVE THE DISCOVERY. ENDEAVOUR WILL GO TO THE CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER IN LOS ANGELES AND ATLANTIS WILL STAY IN FLORIDA AT THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER VISITOR COMPLEX.
SPIRAL
A SPIRAL IS A SPECIAL CURVE IN MATHEMATICS. THIS CURVE STARTS AT A POINT AND THEN GOES AROUND THE POINT BUT GETS FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM IT. THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM A CIRCLE WHICH IS ALWAYS AT THE SAME DISTANCE OR AN ELLIPSE. A SPIRAL IS AN OPEN CURVE UNLIKE CIRCLES AND ELLIPSES WHICH ARE CLOSED CURVES.
A TWO DIMENSIONAL SPIRAL MAY BE DESCRIBED MOST EASILY USING POLAR COORDINATES. THERE THE RADIUS R IS A CONTINUOUS MONOTONIC FUNCTION OF ANGLE THETA. THE CIRCLE WOULD BE REGARDED AS A DEGENERATE CASE. WITH THE CIRCLE THE FUNCTION WOULD NOT BE STRICTLY MONOTONIC BUT CONSTANT.
SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT SORTS OF TWO DIMENSIONAL SPIRALS INCLUDE 
FOR SIMPLE 3 D SPIRALS A THIRD VARIABLE H HEIGHT IS ALSO A CONTINUOUS MONOTONIC FUNCTION OF. FOR EXAMPLE A CONIC HELIX MAY BE DEFINED AS A SPIRAL ON A CONIC SURFACE WITH THE DISTANCE TO THE APEX AN EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION OF.
THE HELIX AND VORTEX CAN BE VIEWED AS A KIND OF THREE DIMENSIONAL SPIRAL.
FOR A HELIX WITH THICKNESS SEE SPRING MATH.
THE STUDY OF SPIRALS IN NATURE HAVE A LONG HISTORY CHRISTOPHER WREN FOUND OUT THAT MANY SHELLS FORM A LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL. JAN SWAMMERDAM OBSERVED THE COMMON MATHEMATICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A WIDE RANGE OF SHELLS FROM HELIX TO SPIRULA AND HENRY NOTTIDGE MOSELEY DESCRIBED THE MATHEMATICS OF UNIVALVE SHELLS. D ARCY WENTWORTH THOMPSON S ON GROWTH AND FORM GIVES EXTENSIVE TREATMENT TO THESE SPIRALS. HE DESCRIBES HOW SHELLS ARE FORMED BY ROTATING A CLOSED CURVE AROUND A FIXED AXIS THE SHAPE OF THE CURVE REMAINS FIXED BUT ITS SIZE GROWS IN A GEOMETRIC PROGRESSION. IN SOME SHELL SUCH AS NAUTILUS AND AMMONITES THE GENERATING CURVE REVOLVES IN A PLANE PIRPENDICULAR TO THE AXIS AND THE SHELL WILL FORM A PLANER DISCOID SHAPE. IN OTHERS IT FOLLOWS A SKEW PATH FORMING A HELICO SPIRAL PATTERN.
THOMPSON ALSO STUDIED SPIRALS OCCURRING IN HORNS TEETH CLAWS AND PLANTS.
SPIRALS IN PLANTS AND ANIMALS ARE FREQUENTLY DESCRIBED AS WHORLS.
A MODEL FOR THE PATTERN OF FLORETS IN THE HEAD OF A SUNFLOWER WAS PROPOSED BY H VOGEL. THIS HAS THE FORM
WHERE FORMULA 2 IS THE INDEX NUMBER OF THE FLORET AND FORMULA 3 IS A CONSTANT SCALING FACTOR AND IS A FORM OF FERMAT S SPIRAL. THE ANGLE 137.5 IS RELATED TO THE GOLDEN RATIO AND GIVES A CLOSE PACKING OF FLORETS.
THE SPIRAL ALSO REPRESENTS INFINITY. STARTING AT A SINGLE POINT AND REVOLVING OUTWARDLY UNTIL THE END OF THE UNIVERSE. BECAUSE OF THIS SOME CIVILIZATIONS BELIEVE THAT THE SPIRAL IS A PATHWAY TO THE AFTERLIFE.
THE SPIRAL PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SYMBOLISM. IT APPEARS IN MEGALITHIC ART NOTABLY IN THE NEWGRANGE TOMB OR IN MANY GALICIAN PETROGLYPHS SUCH AS THE ONE IN MOGOR. SEE ALSO TRIPLE SPIRAL.
SCHOLARS ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THE SUBJECT BUT MANY OF THEM NOW BELIEVE THAT THE SIMPLE SPIRAL IN CHINESE ART MAY BE A SYMBOL OF THE SUN. ROOF TILES FROM THE TANG DYNASTY WITH THIS SYMBOL HAVE BEEN FOUND WEST OF THE ANCIENT CITY OF CHANG AN MODERN DAY XIAN.
THE SPIRAL IS THE MOST ANCIENT SYMBOL FOUND ON EVERY CIVILIZED CONTINENT. BECAUSE IT APPEARS AT BURIAL SITES ACROSS THE GLOBE THE SPIRAL MOST LIKELY REPRESENTED THE LIFE DEATH REBIRTH CYCLE. SIMILARLY THE SPIRAL SYMBOLIZED THE SUN AS ANCIENT PEOPLE THOUGHT THE SUN WAS BORN EACH MORNING DIED EACH NIGHT AND WAS REBORN THE NEXT MORNING. 
SPIRALS ARE ALSO A SYMBOL OF HYPNOSIS. THIS MOST LIKELY COMES FROM THE CLICH OF PEOPLE AND CARTOON CHARACTERS BEING HYPNOTIZED BY STARING INTO A SPINNING SPIRAL ONE EXAMPLE BEING KAA IN DISNEY S THE JUNGLE BOOK. THEY ARE ALSO USED AS A SYMBOL OF DIZZINESS WHERE THE EYES OF A CARTOON CHARACTER ESPECIALLY IN ANIME AND MANGA WILL TURN INTO SPIRALS TO SHOW THEY ARE DIZZY OR DAZED. THE SPIRAL IS ALSO A PROMINENT SYMBOL IN THE ANIME GURREN LAGANN WHERE IT SYMBOLIZES THE DOUBLE HELIX STRUCTURE OF DNA REPRESENTING BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION AND THE SPIRAL STRUCTURE OF A GALAXY REPRESENTING UNIVERSAL EVOLUTION.
SRI LANKA
THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA IN SINHALA IN TAMIL IS A TROPICAL ISLAND NATION OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST OF THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT. THE CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY IS SRI JAYAWARDENEPURA KOTTE WHILE THE LARGEST CITY IS COLOMBO.
IT WAS KNOWN AS CEYLON BEFORE 1972 AND SERENDIB AND SINHALE AMONG OTHER NAMES BEFORE THAT. IT WAS SOUTH ASIA S OLDEST DEMOCRACY.
SRI LANKA HAS THREE MAIN ETHNIC GROUPS. THEY DIFFER IN THEIR RELIGIONS AND ORIGINS AND THERE HAS OFTEN BEEN DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN THE GROUPS. THE TOTAL POPULATION OF THE ISLAND IS OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE AND RAPIDLY EXPANDING.
THE LARGEST OF THE THREE GROUPS IS THE POPULATION OF SINHALESE PEOPLE MOST OF WHOM ARE BUDDHIST AND WHO HAVE THEIR OWN LANGUAGE SINHALA. THEY MAKE UP ABOUT 75 OF THE POPULATION.
THE SECOND LARGEST GROUP IS THE TAMIL PEOPLE WHO ARE HINDU. THERE ARE ABOUT 2 271 000 TAMILS IN SRI LANKA.
THE THIRD LARGEST GROUP IS THE SRI LANKAN MOORS WHO ARE MUSLIM. THERE ARE OVER ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS GROUP. THEY USE TAMIL AS THEIR LANGUAGE TODAY.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SMALLER ETHNIC GROUPS OF WHICH THE VEDDAS ARE NOTABLE BECAUSE THEY MAY BE THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF THE ISLAND OR AT ANY RATE THE EARLIEST TO SURVIVE TODAY. THEY HAVE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE STATUS IN THE ISLAND.
THE ISLAND WAS SUBJECT TO WAVES OF EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT AND EVENTUALLY COLONISATION. THE PORTUGUESE IN THE 16TH AND 17TH CENTURIES THE DUTCH IN THE 17TH AND 18TH CENTURIES AND LASTLY THE BRITISH FROM 1796 TO 1948. THE BRITISH ALWAYS INTERESTED IN TRADE DEVELOPED PLANTATIONS OF COFFEE AND TEA. TEA WAS PLANTED AFTER A FUNGUS DESTROYED THE COFFEE PLANTATIONS IN 1869. THE TEA PLANTATIONS WERE THE BASIS OF SRI LANKAN PROSPERITY FOR A HUNDRED YEARS. LASTLY RUBBER PLANTATIONS WERE STARTED IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY. IN 1965 CEYLON BECAME THE WORLD S LEADING EXPORTER OF TEA WITH 200 000 TONNES OF TEA BEING SHIPPED INTERNATIONALLY ANNUALLY.
INDEPENDENCE FROM THE BRITISH WAS GOT IN 1948 TOGETHER WITH DOMINION STATUS IN THE BRITISH COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS. IN 1972 CEYLON CHANGED ITS NAME OFFICIALLY TO THE REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA AND IS STILL A MEMBER OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
IN 2009 CAME THE END OF A LONG CIVIL WAR BETWEEN SINHALESE AND TAMILS. SINCE THEN TOURISM HAS RAPIDLY GROWN AS A SOURCE OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND CURRENCY.
THE SRI LANKA FLAG IS ALSO KNOWN AS THE LION FLAG BECAUSE OF THE LION ON IT. THE LION IS HOLDING A SWORD IN ITS RIGHT PAW. THERE IS A CRIMSON BACKGROUND WITH FOUR LEAVES IN EACH CORNER. THERE IS A YELLOW BORDER. ON THE LEFT OF THE FLAG THERE ARE THE COLORS GREEN AND SAFFRON.
THE LION REPRESENTS BRAVERY. THE FOUR LEAVES REPRESENTS KARUNA METHTHA MUDITHA AND UPEKSHA. THE ORANGE STRIPE REPRESENTS THE SRI LANKAN TAMILS AND THE GREEN STRIPE REPRESENTS THE SRI LANKAN MOORS.
SRI LANKA HAS 9 PROVINCES.
STANDARD MODEL
THE STANDARD MODEL SM OF PHYSICS IS A THEORY OF THE ELEMENTARY PARTICLES WHICH ARE EITHER FERMIONS OR BOSONS. IT ALSO EXPLAINS THREE OF THE FOUR BASIC FORCES OF NATURE. THE FOUR FUNDAMENTAL FORCES ARE GRAVITY ELECTROMAGNETISM THE WEAK FORCE AND THE STRONG FORCE. GRAVITY IS THE ONE THE MODEL DOES NOT EXPLAIN.
THE MODEL USES THE PARTS OF PHYSICS CALLED QUANTUM MECHANICS AND SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND THE IDEAS OF PHYSICAL FIELD AND SYMMETRY BREAKING. SOME OF THE MATHEMATICS OF THE SM IS GROUP THEORY AND ALSO AS EQUATIONS WHICH HAVE BIGGEST AND SMALLEST POINTS CALLED LAGRANGIANS AND HAMILTONIANS. 
FERMIONS ARE PARTICLES THAT JOIN TOGETHER TO MAKE UP ALL MATTER WE SEE. EXAMPLES OF GROUPS OF FERMIONS ARE THE PROTON AND THE NEUTRON. FERMIONS HAVE PROPERTIES SUCH AS CHARGE AND MASS WHICH CAN BE SEEN IN EVERYDAY LIFE. THEY ALSO HAVE OTHER PROPERTIES SUCH AS SPIN WEAK CHARGE HYPERCHARGE AND COLOR CHARGE WHOSE EFFECTS DO NOT USUALLY APPEAR IN EVERYDAY LIFE. THESE PROPERTIES ARE GIVEN NUMBERS CALLED QUANTUM NUMBERS. 
FERMIONS ARE PARTICLES WHOSE SPIN NUMBERS EQUAL AN ODD POSITIVE NUMBER TIMES ONE HALF 1 2 3 2 5 2 ETC. WE SAY THAT FERMIONS HAVE HALF INTEGER SPIN. 
AN IMPORTANT FACT ABOUT FERMIONS IS THAT THEY FOLLOW A RULE CALLED THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE. THIS RULE SAYS THAT NO TWO FERMIONS CAN BE IN THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE NO TWO FERMIONS IN AN ATOM CAN HAVE THE SAME QUANTUM NUMBERS AT THE SAME TIME. FERMIONS ALSO OBEY A THEORY CALLED FERMI DIRAC STATISTICS. THE WORD FERMION HONORS THE PHYSICIST ENRICO FERMI.
THERE ARE 12 DIFFERENT TYPES OF FERMIONS. EACH TYPE IS CALLED A FLAVOR. THEIR NAMES ARE 
QUARKS ARE GROUPED INTO THREE PAIRS. EACH PAIR IS CALLED A GENERATION. THE FIRST QUARK IN EACH PAIR HAS CHARGE 2 3 AND THE SECOND QUARK HAS CHARGE 1 3. THE THREE KINDS OF NEUTRINO HAVE A CHARGE OF 0. THE ELECTRON MUON AND TAU HAVE CHARGE 1.
MATTER IS MADE OF ATOMS AND ATOMS ARE MADE OF ELECTRONS PROTONS AND NEUTRONS. PROTONS AND NEUTRONS ARE MADE OF UP AND DOWN QUARKS. YOU CAN FIND ONE LEPTON BY ITSELF BUT YOU CAN NEVER FIND QUARKS ALONE. THIS IS BECAUSE QUARKS ARE HELD TOGETHER BY THE COLOR FORCE.
BOSONS ARE THE SECOND TYPE OF ELEMENTARY PARTICLE IN THE STANDARD MODEL. ALL BOSONS HAVE AN INTEGER SPIN 1 2 3 ETC.. SO MANY OF THEM CAN BE IN THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF BOSONS GAUGE BOSONS AND THE HIGGS BOSON. GAUGE BOSONS ARE WHAT MAKE THE FUNDAMENTAL FORCES OF NATURE POSSIBLE. WE ARE NOT YET SURE IF GRAVITY WORKS THROUGH A GAUGE BOSON. EVERY FORCE THAT ACTS ON FERMIONS HAPPENS BECAUSE GAUGE BOSONS ARE MOVING BETWEEN THE FERMIONS CARRYING THE FORCE. BOSONS FOLLOW A THEORY CALLED BOSE EINSTEIN STATISTICS. THE WORD BOSON HONORS THE INDIAN PHYSICIST SATYENDRA NATH BOSE.
THE STANDARD MODEL SAYS THAT THERE ARE 
THESE PARTICLES HAVE ALL BEEN SEEN EITHER IN NATURE OR IN THE LABORATORY. THE MODEL ALSO PREDICTS THAT THERE IS A HIGGS BOSON. THE MODEL SAYS THAT FERMIONS HAVE MASS THEY ARE NOT JUST PURE ENERGY BECAUSE HIGGS BOSONS TRAVEL BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM. THE HIGGS BOSON IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ON JULY 4TH 2012. IT IS THE PARTICLE THAT GIVES MASS TO OTHER PARTICLES.
THERE ARE FOUR BASIC KNOWN FORCES OF NATURE. THESE FORCES AFFECT FERMIONS AND ARE CARRIED BY BOSONS TRAVELING BETWEEN THOSE FERMIONS. THE STANDARD MODEL EXPLAINS THREE OF THESE FOUR FORCES.
THE STRONG AND WEAK FORCES ARE ONLY SEEN INSIDE THE NUCLEUS OF AN ATOM. THEY ONLY WORK OVER VERY TINY DISTANCES DISTANCES THAT ARE ABOUT AS FAR AS A PROTON IS WIDE. THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE AND GRAVITY WORK OVER ANY DISTANCE BUT THE STRENGTH OF THESE FORCES GOES DOWN AS THE AFFECTED OBJECTS GET FARTHER APART. THE FORCE GOES DOWN WITH THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE AFFECTED OBJECTS FOR EXAMPLE IF TWO OBJECTS BECOME TWICE AS FAR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER THE FORCE OF GRAVITY BETWEEN THEM BECOMES FOUR TIMES LESS STRONG 2 4.
THE STANDARD MODEL FALLS SHORT OF BEING A THEORY OF EVERYTHING. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FULL THEORY OF GRAVITATION AS DESCRIBED BY GENERAL RELATIVITY OR ACCOUNT FOR THE ACCELERATING EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE AS POSSIBLY DESCRIBED BY DARK ENERGY. THE MODEL DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY DARK MATTER PARTICLE THAT HAS ALL THE PROPERTIES OBSERVED IN OBSERVATIONAL COSMOLOGY. THE SM IS BELIEVED TO BE THEORETICALLY SELF CONSISTENT. IT HAS DEMONSTRATED HUGE AND CONTINUED SUCCESSES IN EXPERIMENTAL PREDICTIONS BUT IT DOES LEAVE SOME THINGS UNEXPLAINED.
STANDARD DEVIATION
STANDARD DEVIATION IS A NUMBER USED TO TELL HOW MEASUREMENTS FOR A GROUP ARE SPREAD OUT FROM THE AVERAGE MEAN OR EXPECTED VALUE. A LOW STANDARD DEVIATION MEANS THAT MOST OF THE NUMBERS ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE AVERAGE. A HIGH STANDARD DEVIATION MEANS THAT THE NUMBERS ARE SPREAD OUT.
THE REPORTED MARGIN OF ERROR IS USUALLY TWO TIMES THE STANDARD DEVIATION AND GIVES THE RANGE FOR THE TRUE POLL NUMBER. SCIENTISTS COMMONLY REPORT THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF NUMBERS FROM THE AVERAGE NUMBER IN EXPERIMENTS. THEY OFTEN DECIDE THAT ONLY DIFFERENCES BIGGER THAN TWO OR THREE TIMES THE STANDARD DEVIATION ARE IMPORTANT. STANDARD DEVIATION IS ALSO USEFUL IN MONEY WHERE THE STANDARD DEVIATION ON INTEREST EARNED SHOWS HOW DIFFERENT ONE PERSON S INTEREST EARNED MIGHT BE FROM THE AVERAGE.
MANY TIMES ONLY A SAMPLE OR PART OF A GROUP CAN BE MEASURED. THEN A NUMBER CLOSE TO THE STANDARD DEVIATION FOR THE WHOLE GROUP CAN BE FOUND BY A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT EQUATION CALLED THE SAMPLE STANDARD DEVIATION EXPLAINED BELOW.
CONSIDER A GROUP HAVING THE FOLLOWING EIGHT NUMBERS 
THESE EIGHT NUMBERS HAVE THE AVERAGE MEAN OF 5 
TO CALCULATE THE POPULATION STANDARD DEVIATION FIRST FIND THE DIFFERENCE OF EACH NUMBER IN THE LIST FROM THE MEAN. THEN SQUARE THE RESULT OF EACH DIFFERENCE 
NEXT FIND THE AVERAGE OF THESE VALUES SUM DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF NUMBERS. LAST TAKE THE SQUARE ROOT 
THE ANSWER IS THE POPULATION STANDARD DEVIATION. THE FORMULA IS ONLY TRUE IF THE EIGHT NUMBERS WE STARTED WITH ARE THE WHOLE GROUP. IF THEY ARE ONLY A PART OF THE GROUP PICKED AT RANDOM THEN WE SHOULD USE INSTEAD OF IN THE BOTTOM DENOMINATOR OF THE SECOND TO LAST STEP. THEN THE ANSWER IS THE SAMPLE STANDARD DEVIATION.
A SLIGHTLY HARDER REAL LIFE EXAMPLE THE AVERAGE HEIGHT FOR GROWN MEN IN THE UNITED STATES IS 70 WITH A STANDARD DEVIATION OF 3. A STANDARD DEVIATION OF 3 MEANS THAT MOST MEN ABOUT 68 ASSUMING A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION HAVE A HEIGHT 3 TALLER TO 3 SHORTER THAN THE AVERAGE 67 73 ONE STANDARD DEVIATION. ALMOST ALL MEN ABOUT 95 HAVE A HEIGHT 6 TALLER TO 6 SHORTER THAN THE AVERAGE 64 76 TWO STANDARD DEVIATIONS. THREE STANDARD DEVIATIONS INCLUDE ALL THE NUMBERS FOR 99.7 OF THE SAMPLE POPULATION BEING STUDIED. THIS IS TRUE IF THE DISTRIBUTION IS NORMAL BELL SHAPED.
IF THE STANDARD DEVIATION WERE ZERO THEN ALL MEN WOULD BE EXACTLY 70 TALL. IF THE STANDARD DEVIATION WERE 20 THEN SOME MEN WOULD BE MUCH TALLER OR MUCH SHORTER THAN THE AVERAGE WITH A TYPICAL RANGE OF ABOUT 50 90. 
FOR ANOTHER EXAMPLE EACH OF THE THREE GROUPS 0 0 14 14 0 6 8 14 AND 6 6 8 8 HAS AN AVERAGE MEAN OF 7. BUT THEIR STANDARD DEVIATIONS ARE 7 5 AND 1. THE THIRD GROUP HAS A MUCH SMALLER STANDARD DEVIATION THAN THE OTHER TWO BECAUSE ITS NUMBERS ARE ALL CLOSE TO 7. THE BASIC IDEA IS THE STANDARD DEVIATION TELLS US HOW FAR FROM THE AVERAGE THE REST OF THE NUMBERS TEND TO BE. IT WILL HAVE THE SAME UNITS AS THE NUMBERS THEMSELVES. IF FOR EXAMPLE THE GROUP 0 6 8 14 IS THE AGES OF A GROUP OF FOUR BROTHERS IN YEARS THE AVERAGE IS 7 YEARS AND THE STANDARD DEVIATION IS 5 YEARS.
STANDARD DEVIATION MAY SERVE AS A MEASURE OF UNCERTAINTY. IN SCIENCE FOR EXAMPLE THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF A GROUP OF REPEATED MEASUREMENTS HELPS SCIENTISTS KNOW HOW SURE THEY ARE OF THE AVERAGE NUMBER. WHEN DECIDING WHETHER MEASUREMENTS FROM AN EXPERIMENT AGREE WITH A PREDICTION THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF THOSE MEASUREMENTS IS VERY IMPORTANT. IF THE AVERAGE NUMBER FROM THE EXPERIMENTS IS TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE PREDICTED NUMBER WITH THE DISTANCE MEASURED IN STANDARD DEVIATIONS THEN THE THEORY BEING TESTED MAY NOT BE RIGHT. SEE PREDICTION INTERVAL.
THE USE OF UNDERSTANDING THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF A SET OF VALUES IS IN KNOWING HOW LARGE A DIFFERENCE FROM THE AVERAGE MEAN IS EXPECTED.
AS A SIMPLE EXAMPLE CONSIDER THE AVERAGE DAILY HIGH TEMPERATURES FOR TWO CITIES ONE INLAND AND ONE NEAR THE OCEAN. IT IS HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE RANGE OF DAILY HIGH TEMPERATURES FOR CITIES NEAR THE OCEAN IS SMALLER THAN FOR CITIES INLAND. THESE TWO CITIES MAY EACH HAVE THE SAME AVERAGE DAILY HIGH TEMPERATURE. HOWEVER THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE DAILY HIGH TEMPERATURE FOR THE COASTAL CITY WILL BE LESS THAN THAT OF THE INLAND CITY.
ANOTHER WAY OF SEEING IT IS TO CONSIDER SPORTS TEAMS. IN ANY SPORT THERE WILL BE TEAMS THAT ARE GOOD AT SOME THINGS AND NOT AT OTHERS. THE TEAMS THAT ARE RANKED HIGHEST WILL NOT SHOW A LOT OF DIFFERENCES IN ABILITIES. THEY DO WELL IN MOST CATEGORIES. THE LOWER THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF THEIR ABILITY IN EACH CATEGORY THE MORE BALANCED AND CONSISTENT THEY ARE. TEAMS WITH A HIGHER STANDARD DEVIATION HOWEVER WILL BE LESS PREDICTABLE. FOR EXAMPLE A TEAM THAT IS USUALLY BAD IN MOST CATEGORIES WILL HAVE A LOW STANDARD DEVIATION. A TEAM THAT IS USUALLY GOOD IN MOST CATEGORIES WILL ALSO HAVE A LOW STANDARD DEVIATION. HOWEVER A TEAM WITH A HIGH STANDARD DEVIATION MIGHT BE THE TYPE OF TEAM THAT SCORES MANY POINTS STRONG OFFENSE BUT ALSO LETS THE OTHER TEAM SCORE MANY POINTS WEAK DEFENSE. 
TRYING TO KNOW AHEAD OF TIME WHICH TEAMS WILL WIN MAY INCLUDE LOOKING AT THE STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF THE VARIOUS TEAM STATISTICS. NUMBERS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM EXPECTED CAN MATCH STRENGTHS VS. WEAKNESSES TO SHOW WHAT REASONS MAY BE MOST IMPORTANT IN KNOWING WHICH TEAM WILL WIN. 
IN RACING THE TIME A DRIVER TAKES TO FINISH EACH LAP AROUND THE TRACK IS MEASURED. A DRIVER WITH A LOW STANDARD DEVIATION OF LAP TIMES IS MORE CONSISTENT THAN A DRIVER WITH A HIGHER STANDARD DEVIATION. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE USED TO HELP UNDERSTAND HOW A DRIVER CAN REDUCE THE TIME TO FINISH A LAP.
IN MONEY STANDARD DEVIATION MAY MEAN THE RISK THAT A PRICE WILL GO UP OR DOWN STOCKS BONDS PROPERTY ETC.. IT CAN ALSO MEAN THE RISK THAT A GROUP OF PRICES WILL GO UP OR DOWN ACTIVELY MANAGED MUTUAL FUNDS INDEX MUTUAL FUNDS OR ETFS. RISK IS ONE REASON TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TO BUY. RISK IS A NUMBER PEOPLE CAN USE TO KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY THEY MAY EARN OR LOSE. AS RISK GETS LARGER THE RETURN ON AN INVESTMENT CAN BE MORE THAN EXPECTED THE PLUS STANDARD DEVIATION. HOWEVER AN INVESTMENT CAN ALSO LOSE MORE MONEY THAN EXPECTED THE MINUS STANDARD DEVIATION. 
FOR EXAMPLE A PERSON HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO STOCKS. STOCK A OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS HAD AN AVERAGE RETURN OF 10 PERCENT WITH A STANDARD DEVIATION OF 20 PERCENTAGE POINTS PP. STOCK B OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS HAD AN AVERAGE RETURN OF 12 PERCENT BUT A HIGHER STANDARD DEVIATION OF 30 PP. THINKING ABOUT THE RISK THE PERSON MAY DECIDE THAT STOCK A IS THE SAFER CHOICE. EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT MAKE AS MUCH MONEY THEY PROBABLY WILL NOT LOSE MUCH MONEY EITHER. THE PERSON MAY THINK THAT STOCK B S 2 POINT HIGHER AVERAGE IS NOT WORTH THE ADDITIONAL 10 PP STANDARD DEVIATION GREATER RISK OR UNCERTAINTY OF THE EXPECTED RETURN.
MOST MATH EQUATIONS FOR STANDARD DEVIATION ASSUME THAT THE NUMBERS ARE NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED. THIS MEANS THAT THE NUMBERS ARE SPREAD OUT IN A CERTAIN WAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AVERAGE VALUE. 
THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION IS ALSO CALLED A GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION BECAUSE IT WAS DISCOVERED BY CARL FRIEDRICH GAUSS. IT IS OFTEN CALLED THE BELL CURVE BECAUSE THE NUMBERS SPREAD OUT TO MAKE THE SHAPE OF A BELL ON A GRAPH. 
NUMBERS ARE NOT NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED IF THEY ARE GROUPED ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AVERAGE VALUE. NUMBERS CAN BE SPREAD OUT AND STILL BE NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED. THE STANDARD DEVIATION TELLS HOW WIDELY THE NUMBERS ARE SPREAD OUT.
THE AVERAGE MEAN AND THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF A SET OF DATA ARE USUALLY WRITTEN TOGETHER. THEN A PERSON CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AVERAGE NUMBER IS AND HOW WIDELY OTHER NUMBERS IN THE GROUP ARE SPREAD OUT. 
THE WAY A GROUP OF NUMBERS IS SPREAD OUT CAN ALSO BE GIVEN BY THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION WHICH IS THE STANDARD DEVIATION DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE. IT IS A DIMENSIONLESS NUMBER. COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION IS OFTEN MULTIPLIED BY 100 AND WRITTEN AS A PERCENTAGE.
THE TERM STANDARD DEVIATION WAS FIRST USED IN WRITING BY KARL PEARSON IN 1894 AFTER HE USED IT IN LECTURES. IT WAS AS A REPLACEMENT FOR EARLIER NAMES FOR THE SAME IDEA FOR EXAMPLE GAUSS USED MEAN ERROR.
STAR
A STAR IS A GIANT BALL OF GLOWING HOT MATTER IN SPACE. THAT MATTER IS CALLED PLASMA. STARS ARE HELD TOGETHER BY GRAVITY. THEY GIVE OUT HEAT AND LIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO HOT.
STARS ARE HOT BECAUSE NUCLEAR REACTIONS HAPPEN INSIDE THEM. THOSE REACTIONS ARE CALLED NUCLEAR FUSION. NUCLEAR FUSION MAKES LIGHT AND HEAT AND MAKES BIGGER AND BIGGER CHEMICAL ELEMENTS. STARS HAVE A LOT OF HYDROGEN. NUCLEAR FUSION CHANGES HYDROGEN INTO HELIUM. WHEN A STAR GETS OLD IT STARTS TO CHANGE THE HELIUM INTO OTHER BIGGER CHEMICAL ELEMENTS LIKE CARBON AND OXYGEN. FUSION MAKES A LOT OF ENERGY. THE ENERGY MAKES THE STAR VERY HOT. THE ENERGY PRODUCED BY STARS MOVES RADIATES AWAY FROM THEM. MUCH OF THE ENERGY LEAVES AS LIGHT. THE REST LEAVES AS OTHER KINDS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION.
THE STAR NEAREST TO EARTH IS THE SUN. THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN SUPPORTS ALMOST ALL LIFE ON EARTH BY PROVIDING LIGHT FOR PLANTS. PLANTS TURN THE LIGHT INTO ENERGY IN A PROCESS CALLED PHOTOSYNTHESIS. THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN ALSO CAUSES WEATHER ON EARTH. 
WE CAN SEE OTHER STARS IN THE NIGHT SKY WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN. LIKE THE SUN THEY ARE MADE MOSTLY OF HYDROGEN AND A LITTLE BIT OF HELIUM PLUS OTHER ELEMENTS. ASTRONOMERS OFTEN COMPARE THOSE OTHER STARS TO THE SUN. FOR EXAMPLE THEIR MASS IS GIVEN IN SOLAR MASSES. A SMALL STAR MAY BE 0.2 SOLAR MASSES A BIG ONE 4.0 SOLAR MASSES.
THE EARTH AND OTHER PLANETS MOVE AROUND ORBIT THE SUN. THE SUN AND ALL THINGS THAT ORBIT THE SUN ARE CALLED THE SOLAR SYSTEM. MANY OTHER STARS HAVE PLANETS ORBITING THEM THOSE PLANETS ARE CALLED EXOPLANETS. IF YOU WERE ON AN EXOPLANET OUR SUN WOULD LOOK LIKE A STAR IN THE SKY BUT YOU COULD NOT SEE THE EARTH BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TOO FAR AWAY.
PROXIMA CENTAURI IS THE STAR THAT IS CLOSEST TO OUR SUN. IT IS 39.9 TRILLION KILOMETRES AWAY. THIS IS 4.2 LIGHT YEARS AWAY. THIS MEANS THAT LIGHT FROM PROXIMA CENTAURI TAKES 4.2 YEARS TO REACH EARTH.
ASTRONOMERS THINK THERE ARE A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF STARS IN THE UNIVERSE. THEY ESTIMATE GUESS THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST 70 SEXTILLION STARS. THAT IS 70 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 WHICH IS OVER 200 BILLION TIMES THE FEW HUNDRED BILLION STARS IN THE MILKY WAY OUR GALAXY. 
MOST STARS ARE VERY OLD. THEY ARE USUALLY THOUGHT TO BE BETWEEN 1 BILLION AND 10 BILLION YEARS OLD. THE OLDEST STARS ARE 13.7 BILLION YEARS OLD. THAT IS AS OLD AS THE UNIVERSE. SOME YOUNG STARS ARE ONLY A FEW MILLION YEARS OLD. YOUNG STARS ARE MOSTLY BRIGHTER THAN OLD ONES. 
STARS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES. THE SMALLEST STARS ARE NEUTRON STARS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY DEAD STARS. THEY ARE NO BIGGER THAN A CITY. THE NEUTRON STAR HAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF MASS IN A VERY SMALL SPACE. 
HYPERGIANT STARS ARE THE LARGEST STARS IN THE UNIVERSE. THEY HAVE A DIAMETER OVER 1 500 TIMES BIGGER THAN THE SUN. IF THE SUN WAS A HYPERGIANT STAR IT WOULD REACH OUT TO AS FAR AS JUPITER.
THE STAR BETELGEUSE IS A RED SUPERGIANT STAR. ALTHOUGH THESE STARS ARE VERY LARGE THEY ALSO HAVE LOW DENSITY.
SOME STARS LOOK BRIGHTER THAN OTHER STARS. THIS DIFFERENCE IS MEASURED IN TERMS OF APPARENT MAGNITUDE. THERE ARE TWO REASONS WHY STARS HAVE DIFFERENT APPARENT MAGNITUDE. IF A STAR IS VERY CLOSE TO US IT WILL APPEAR MUCH BRIGHTER. THIS IS JUST LIKE A CANDLE. A CANDLE THAT IS CLOSE TO US APPEARS BRIGHTER. THE OTHER REASON A STAR CAN APPEAR BRIGHTER IS THAT IT IS HOTTER THAN ANOTHER COOLER STAR.
STARS GIVE OFF LIGHT BUT ALSO GIVE OFF A SOLAR WIND AND NEUTRINOS. THESE ARE VERY SMALL PARTICLES OF MATTER.
STARS ARE MADE OF MASS AND MASS MAKES GRAVITY. GRAVITY MAKES PLANETS ORBIT STARS. THIS IS WHY THE EARTH ORBITS THE SUN. THE GRAVITY OF TWO STARS CAN MAKE THEM GO AROUND EACH OTHER. STARS THAT ORBIT EACH OTHER ARE CALLED BINARY STARS. SCIENTISTS THINK THERE ARE MANY BINARY STARS. THERE ARE EVEN GROUPS OF THREE OR MORE STARS THAT ORBIT EACH OTHER. PROXIMA CENTAURI IS A SMALL STAR THAT ORBITS OTHER STARS.
STARS ARE NOT SPREAD EVENLY ACROSS ALL OF SPACE. THEY ARE GROUPED INTO GALAXIES. A GALAXY CONTAINS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF STARS.
STARS HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR ALL OF HISTORY. STARS HAVE BEEN PART OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICES. LONG AGO PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT STARS COULD NEVER DIE.
ASTRONOMERS ORGANIZED STARS INTO GROUPS CALLED CONSTELLATIONS. THEY USED THE CONSTELLATIONS TO HELP THEM SEE THE MOTION OF THE PLANETS AND TO GUESS THE POSITION OF THE SUN. THE MOTION OF THE SUN AND THE STARS WAS USED TO MAKE CALENDARS. THE CALENDARS WERE USED BY FARMERS TO DECIDE WHEN TO PLANT CROPS AND WHEN TO HARVEST THEM.
STARS ARE MADE IN NEBULAE. THESE ARE AREAS THAT HAVE MORE GAS THAN NORMAL SPACE. THE GAS IN A NEBULA IS PULLED TOGETHER BY GRAVITY. THE ORION NEBULA IS AN EXAMPLE OF A PLACE WHERE GAS IS COMING TOGETHER TO FORM STARS.
STARS SPEND MOST OF THEIR LIVES COMBINING FUSING HYDROGEN WITH HYDROGEN TO MAKE ENERGY. WHEN HYDROGEN IS FUSED IT MAKES HELIUM AND IT MAKES A LOT OF ENERGY. TO FUSE HYDROGEN INTO HELIUM IT MUST BE VERY HOT AND THE PRESSURE MUST BE VERY HIGH. FUSION HAPPENS AT THE CENTER OF STARS CALLED THE CORE.
THE SMALLEST STARS RED DWARFS FUSE THEIR HYDROGEN SLOWLY AND LIVE FOR 100 BILLION YEARS. RED DWARFS LIVE LONGER THAN ANY OTHER TYPE OF STAR. AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES THEY BECOME DIMMER AND DIMMER. RED DWARFS DO NOT EXPLODE.
WHEN VERY HEAVY STARS DIE THEY EXPLODE. THIS EXPLOSION IS CALLED A SUPERNOVA. WHEN A SUPERNOVA HAPPENS IN A NEBULA THE EXPLOSION PUSHES THE GAS IN THE NEBULA TOGETHER. THIS MAKES THE GAS IN THE NEBULA VERY THICK DENSE. GRAVITY AND EXPLODING STARS BOTH HELP TO BRING THE GAS TOGETHER TO MAKE NEW STARS IN NEBULAS.
MOST STARS USE UP THE HYDROGEN AT THEIR CORE. WHEN THEY DO THEIR CORE BECOMES SMALLER AND BECOMES HOTTER. IT BECOMES SO HOT IT PUSHES AWAY THE OUTER PART OF THE STAR. THE OUTER PART EXPANDS AND IT MAKES A RED GIANT STAR. ASTRO PHYSICISTS THINK THAT IN ABOUT 5 BILLION YEARS THE SUN WILL BE A RED GIANT. OUR SUN WILL BE SO LARGE IT WILL EAT THE EARTH. AFTER OUR SUN STOPS USING HYDROGEN TO MAKE ENERGY IT WILL USE HELIUM IN ITS VERY HOT CORE. IT WILL BE HOTTER THAN WHEN IT WAS FUSING HYDROGEN. HEAVY STARS WILL ALSO MAKE ELEMENTS HEAVIER THAN HELIUM. AS A STAR MAKES HEAVIER AND HEAVIER ELEMENTS IT MAKES LESS AND LESS ENERGY. IRON IS A HEAVY ELEMENT MADE IN HEAVY STARS. 
OUR STAR IS AN AVERAGE STAR. AVERAGE STARS WILL PUSH AWAY THEIR OUTER GASES. THE GAS IT PUSHES AWAY MAKES A CLOUD CALLED A PLANETARY NEBULA. THE CORE PART OF THE STAR WILL REMAIN. IT WILL BE A BALL AS BIG AS THE EARTH AND CALLED A WHITE DWARF. IT WILL FADE INTO A BLACK DWARF OVER A VERY LONG TIME. 
LATER IN LARGE STARS HEAVIER ELEMENTS ARE MADE BY FUSION. FINALLY THE STAR MAKES A SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION. MOST THINGS HAPPEN IN THE UNIVERSE SO SLOWLY WE DO NOT NOTICE. BUT SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS HAPPEN IN ONLY 100 SECONDS. WHEN A SUPERNOVA EXPLODES ITS FLASH IS AS BRIGHT AS A 100 BILLION STARS. THE DYING STAR IS SO BRIGHT IT CAN BE SEEN DURING THE DAY. SUPERNOVA MEANS NEW STAR BECAUSE PEOPLE USED TO THINK IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW STAR. TODAY WE KNOW THAT A SUPERNOVA IS THE DEATH OF AN OLD STAR. THE GAS OF THE STAR IS PUSHED AWAY BY THE EXPLOSION. IT FORMS A GIANT CLOUD OF GAS CALLED A PLANETARY NEBULA. THE CRAB NEBULA IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. ALL THAT REMAINS IS A NEUTRON STAR. IF THE STAR WAS VERY HEAVY THE STAR WILL MAKE A BLACK HOLE. GRAVITY IN A BLACK HOLE IS EXTREMELY STRONG. IT IS SO STRONG THAT EVEN LIGHT CANNOT ESCAPE FROM A BLACK HOLE.
THE HEAVIEST ELEMENTS ARE MADE IN THE EXPLOSION OF A SUPERNOVA. AFTER BILLIONS OF YEARS OF FLOATING IN SPACE THE GAS AND DUST COME TOGETHER TO MAKE NEW STARS AND NEW PLANETS. MUCH OF THE GAS AND DUST IN SPACE COMES FROM SUPERNOVAE. OUR SUN THE EARTH AND ALL LIVING THINGS ARE MADE FROM STAR DUST.
ASTRONOMERS HAVE KNOWN FOR CENTURIES THAT STARS HAVE DIFFERENT COLORS. WHEN LOOKING AT AN ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM ULTRAVIOLET WAVES ARE THE SHORTEST AND INFRARED ARE THE LONGEST. THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM HAS WAVELENGTHS BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES. 
MODERN INSTRUMENTS CAN MEASURE VERY PRECISELY THE COLOR OF A STAR. THIS ALLOWS ASTRONOMERS TO DETERMINE THAT STAR S TEMPERATURE BECAUSE A HOTTER STAR S BLACK BODY RADIATION HAS SHORTER WAVELENGTHS. THE HOTTEST STARS ARE BLUE AND VIOLET THEN WHITE THEN YELLOW AND THE COOLEST ARE RED. KNOWING THE COLOR AND ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE ASTRONOMERS CAN PLACE THE STAR ON THE HERTZSPRUNG RUSSELL DIAGRAM AND ESTIMATE ITS HABITABLE ZONE AND OTHER FACTS ABOUT IT. 
FOR EXAMPLE OUR SUN IS WHITE AND THE EARTH IS THE PERFECT DISTANCE AWAY FOR LIFE. IF OUR SUN WAS A HOTTER BLUE STAR HOWEVER EARTH WOULD HAVE TO BE MUCH FARTHER AWAY OR ELSE IT WOULD BE TOO HOT TO HAVE WATER AND SUSTAIN LIFE.
STATE
IN MODERN POLITICS A STATE IS AN ASSOCIATION WHICH HAS CONTROL OVER A GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR TERRITORY. STATES ARE SEEN AS HAVING THREE MAIN PIECES 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT FORMS OF GOVERNMENT A STATE CAN HAVE FOR EXAMPLE A REPUBLIC OR A MONARCHY. SOMETIMES STATES FORM THEIR OWN COUNTRIES. AT OTHER TIMES MANY STATES WORK TOGETHER TO FORM A COUNTRY LIKE THE UNITED STATES. MOST STATES ALSO HAVE ARMED FORCES CIVIL SERVICE LAW AND POLICE.
THE EARLIEST STATES WERE JUST HUMAN SETTLEMENTS. A GROUP OF FARMERS AND MERCHANTS WORKING TOGETHER COULD BE STATES SINCE PEOPLE CAN CONTROL THEM AND PROTECT THEM.
MORE ORGANIZED STATES COULD BE MONARCHIES SUCH AS EARLY EGYPT UNDER THE PHARAOH. FOLLOWING THIS WERE LARGER MORE MILITARY BASED STATES SUCH AS THE BABYLONIAN EMPIRE OR ROMAN EMPIRE. THE MOST FAMOUS EARLY STATES HOWEVER WERE THE ANCIENT GREEK STATES WHICH HAD FREEDOM WRITING AND A DEMOCRACY.
WHEN THE MILITARY BASED STATE THE ROMAN EMPIRE FELL LOTS OF LITTLE STATES WERE MADE AND EACH WAS ALSO MILITARY BASED AND CONTROLLED BY A KING. THESE STATES DID NOT OFTEN WORK TOGETHER AND WAR RAGED. HOWEVER ONCE PEOPLE WITHIN THE STATE ITSELF STARTED FIGHTING WHAT S CALLED A CIVIL WAR THE KINGS HAD TO MAKE PEACE AND START PARLIAMENTS. HI
MODERN STATES SOON STARTED IN THE LATE 15TH CENTURY. THE MAIN STATES IN EUROPE WERE 
THESE STATES ALL TRIED TO IMPROVE THEIR POLITICS AND ECONOMY AND BECAME MORE AND MORE LIKE THE STATES TODAY. THEY FORMED PROPER BOUNDARIES FOR THEIR LANDS AND WORKED WITH POWER WITHIN THE STATE ITSELF MORE SUCH AS THE CHURCH OR THE NOBILITY. THEY MADE ARMIES TAX SYSTEMS AND EMBASSIES ALL TO HELP MAKE THEM MORE POWERFUL AND STABLE.
TYPES OF STATE CAN BE SEPARATED INTO TWO CATEGORIES DEMOCRACY AND DICTATORSHIP. HOWEVER JUST BECAUSE A GROUP OF STATES ARE ALL DEMOCRATIC DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY FOLLOW THE SAME RULES. IRAN PAKISTAN FRANCE GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ARE ALL STATES. EACH OF THEM SEES ITSELF AS A DEMOCRACY. EACH OF THEM HOWEVER HAS A DIFFERENT IDEA OF WHAT DEMOCRACY REALLY MEANS.
DIFFERENT STATES OF THE SAME CATEGORY CAN ALSO FUNCTION DIFFERENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE TWO DEMOCRATIC STATES MAY BE QUITE DIFFERENT IF ONE HAS A WELL TRAINED POLICE OR ARMY WHILE THE OTHER DOES NOT. THEREFORE THE WORD STATE ONLY TELLS US WHAT TYPE OF GOVERNMENT THAT STATE FOLLOWS DEMOCRATIC OR DICTATORSHIP AND DOES NOT TELL US ABOUT THE COUNTRY ITSELF.
THERE ARE LOTS OF SUB TYPES OF STATE BRANCHING OFF FROM DEMOCRACY AND DICTATORSHIP. THE MAIN ONES ARE PLURALISM MARXISM AND INSTITUTIONALISM.
PLURALISM HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR IN THE UNITED STATES. IT SHOWS THE STATE AS A NEUTRAL PLACE FOR SETTLING ARGUMENTS BETWEEN OTHER STATES. PLURALISM TELLS US THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE NOT EQUAL BUT STILL ALLOWS EACH GROUP OF PEOPLE TO TELL THE STATE WHAT TO DO. THIS TYPE OF STATE IS CALLED A POLYARCHY.
ALSO IN A PLURALIST STATE POLITICS THE MILITARY AND THE ECONOMY ARE ALL UNITED AND WORK TOGETHER. THIS MEANS THAT ALL POWER IN THE STATE IS DIFFUSED ACROSS THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE.
MARXISM WAS POPULAR IN EUROPE IN THE 1960S AND 1970S. IT WAS STARTED BY KARL MARX AND FRIEDRICH ENGELS. MARXISM REJECTS THE IDEA THAT A STATE IS THERE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE LIVING IN IT AND IS DEFINITELY NOT A NEUTRAL PLACE FOR SETTLING ARGUMENTS.
THE MAIN JOB OF A MARXIST STATE IS TO PROTECT CAPITALIST MADE PROFITS AND TO HELP PEOPLE MAKE CONTRACTS TO KEEP ECONOMY IN THE STATE FAIR. THIS IS A GOOD IDEA HOWEVER THE PERSON WHO MAKES THE MONEY BY USING PRODUCTION OR CONTRACTS HAS POWER OVER THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS HIM. THIS MEANS THAT THE WORKING CLASS THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN FACTORIES ETC. HAVE HARDLY ANY POWER BUT THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE FACTORIES HAVE A LOT OF POWER. BASICALLY INSTEAD OF GIVING POWER TO EVERYONE SUCH AS A POLYARCHY WOULD DO ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE PEOPLE HAVE POWER.
BOTH MARXISM AND PLURALISM STATES HAVE TO REACT TO THE ACTIVITIES OF GROUPS OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE ITSELF. INSTITUTIONALIST STATES DO NOT SEE THEMSELVES AS INSTRUMENTS TO BE CONTROLLED THEY ARE MORE JUST GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS. IN THIS AREA THE PEOPLE JUST FORM GROUPS THEMSELVES. AN INSTITUTIONALIST STATE CAN BE MADE UP OF BOTH MARXIST AND PLURALIST PEOPLE BOTH WHICH HAVE THE POWER TO CONTROL THEMSELVES AND NOT INFLUENCE THE OTHER PARTIES OF THE STATE.
ANARCHISM IS WHEN A GROUP OF PEOPLE HAVE COMPLETE FREEDOM AND DO NOT BELIEVE IN HAVING A STATE AT ALL. ANARCHISTS ARE A LOT LIKE MARXISTS SINCE THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE EQUAL BUT THEY BELIEVE OPPOSITE TO MARXISTS THAT A COUNTRY CAN WORK WITHOUT ANY ORGANIZATIONS IN IT. LAW AND ORDER ARE NOT NECESSARY.
ANARCHISTS SUCH AS BAKUNIN AND KROPOTKIN IN THE 19TH CENTURY OFTEN WANT A FORM OF MARXISM BUT IGNORING SOME OF THEIR RULES. THEY WANT WORKERS TO MANAGE THEMSELVES AND SIMPLY GET PAID FOR WHAT THEY DO RATHER THAN GETTING PAID IN WAGES.
STRING THEORY
STRING THEORY IS A SET OF ATTEMPTS TO MODEL THE FOUR KNOWN FUNDAMENTAL INTERACTIONS GRAVITATION ELECTROMAGNETISM STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE WEAK NUCLEAR FORCE TOGETHER IN ONE THEORY. THIS TRIES TO RESOLVE THE ALLEGED CONFLICT BETWEEN CLASSICAL PHYSICS AND QUANTUM PHYSICS BY ELEMENTARY UNITS THE ONE CLASSICAL FORCE GRAVITY AND A NEW QUANTUM FIELD THEORY OF THE OTHER THREE FUNDAMENTAL FORCES.
EINSTEIN HAD SOUGHT A UNIFIED FIELD THEORY TO EXPLAIN THE FUNDAMENTAL INTERACTIONS WITHIN ONE MODEL REVEALING THE MECHANICS OF THE UNIVERSE. YET TODAY S SEARCH FOR A UNIFIED FIELD THEORY THAT IS QUANTIZED AND THAT EXPLAINS MATTER S STRUCTURE TOO IS CALLED THE SEARCH FOR A THEORY OF EVERYTHING TOE. THE MOST PROMINENT CONTENDER AS A TOE IS STRING THEORY CONVERTED INTO SUPERSTRING THEORY WITH ITS 6 HIGHER DIMENSIONS IN ADDITION TO THE FOUR COMMON DIMENSIONS 3D TIME. 
SOME SUPERSTRING THEORIES SEEM TO COME TOGETHER ON A SHARED RANGE OF GEOMETRY THAT ACCORDING TO STRING THEORISTS IS APPARENTLY THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE. THE MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK THAT UNIFIES THE MULTIPLE SUPERSTRING THEORIES UPON THAT SHARED GEOMETRICAL RANGE IS M THEORY. MANY STRING THEORISTS ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT M THEORY EXPLAINS OUR UNIVERSE S VERY STRUCTURE AND PERHAPS EXPLAINS HOW OTHER UNIVERSES IF THEY EXIST ARE STRUCTURED AS WELL. M THEORY SUPERGRAVITY THEORY HAS 7 HIGHER DIMENSIONS 4D.
INTRODUCTIONS TO STRING THEORY THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC MUST FIRST EXPLAIN PHYSICS. SOME OF THE CONTROVERSIES OVER STRING THEORY RESULT FROM MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT PHYSICS. A COMMON MISUNDERSTANDING EVEN AMONG SCIENTISTS IS THE PRESUMPTION THAT A THEORY IS PROVED TRUE IN ITS EXPLANATION OF THE NATURAL WORLD WHEREVER ITS PREDICTIONS ARE SUCCESSFUL. ANOTHER MISCONCEPTION IS THAT EARLIER PHYSICAL SCIENTISTS INCLUDING CHEMISTS HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED THE WORLD A MISCONCEPTION SUGGESTING THAT STRING THEORISTS BEGAN GENERATING STRANGE HYPOTHESES ONCE THEY BECAME UNACCOUNTABLY SET FREE FROM TRUTH.
NEWTON S LAW OF UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION UG ADDED TO THE THREE GALILEAN LAWS OF MOTION AND SOME OTHER PRESUMPTIONS WAS PUBLISHED IN 1687. NEWTON S THEORY SUCCESSFULLY MODELED INTERACTIONS AMONG OBJECTS OF OBSERVABLE SIZE A RANGE OF PHENOMENA NOW CALLED THE CLASSICAL REALM. COULOMB S LAW MODELED ELECTRIC ATTRACTION. MAXWELL S ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD THEORY UNIFIED ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM WHILE OPTICS EMERGED FROM THIS FIELD.
LIGHT S SPEED REMAINED APPROXIMATELY CONSTANT WHEN MEASURED BY AN OBSERVER TRAVELING IN ITS FIELD HOWEVER ALTHOUGH ADDITION OF VELOCITIES PREDICTED THE FIELD TO BE SLOWER OR FASTER RELATIVE TO THE OBSERVER TRAVELING WITH OR AGAINST IT. SO VERSUS THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD THE OBSERVER S SPEED WAS CONTINUALLY LOST. STILL NO VIOLATION OF GALILEAN INVARIANCE WHEREBY THE LAWS OF MECHANICS PROCEED IDENTICALLY FOR ALL OBJECTS EXHIBITING INERTIA WAS OBSERVED.
IN 1905 EINSTEIN S SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY EXPLAINED THE ACCURACY OF BOTH MAXWELL S ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD AND GALILEAN RELATIVITY BY STATING THAT THE FIELD S SPEED IS ABSOLUTE A UNIVERSAL CONSTANT WHEREAS BOTH SPACE AND TIME ARE LOCAL PHENOMENA RELATIVE TO THE OBJECT S ENERGY. WITH RESPECT TO AN OBSERVER AN OBJECT IN RELATIVE MOTION SHORTENS ALONG THE DIRECTION OF ITS MOMENTUM LENGTH CONTRACTION AND ITS UNFOLDING OF EVENTS SLOWS TIME DILATION. A PASSENGER ON THE OBJECT CANNOT DETECT THE CHANGE AS ALL MEASURING DEVICES RODS AND CLOCKS AS WELL AS EYES AND BRAINS ABOARD THAT VEHICLE HAVE EXPERIENCED LENGTH CONTRACTION AND TIME DILATION. ONLY AN EXTERNAL OBSERVER EXPERIENCING RELATIVE REST MEASURES THE OBJECT IN RELATIVE MOTION SHORTENED ALONG ITS TRAVEL PATHWAY AND ITS EVENTS SLOWED. SPECIAL RELATIVITY LEFT NEWTON S THEORY WHICH STATES SPACE AND TIME AS ABSOLUTE UNABLE TO EXPLAIN GRAVITATION.
BY THE EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE EINSTEIN INFERRED THAT BEING UNDER EITHER GRAVITATION OR CONSTANT ACCELERATION ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE EXPERIENCES THAT MIGHT SHARE A PHYSICAL MECHANISM. THE SUGGESTED MECHANISM WAS PROGRESSIVE LENGTH CONTRACTION AND TIME DILATION A CONSEQUENCE OF THE LOCAL ENERGY DENSITY WITHIN 3D SPACE ESTABLISHING A PROGRESSIVE TENSION WITHIN A RIGID OBJECT RELIEVING ITS TENSION BY MOVING TOWARD THE LOCATION OF GREATEST ENERGY DENSITY. SPECIAL RELATIVITY WOULD BE A LIMITED CASE OF A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD. SPECIAL RELATIVITY WOULD APPLY WHEN THE ENERGY DENSITY ACROSS 3D SPACE IS UNIFORM AND SO THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD IS SCALED UNIFORMLY FROM LOCATION TO LOCATION WHY AN OBJECT EXPERIENCES NO ACCELERATION AND THUS NO GRAVITATION.
IN 1915 EINSTEIN S GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY NEWLY EXPLAINED GRAVITATION WITH 4D SPACETIME MODELED AS A LORENTZIAN MANIFOLD. TIME IS ONE DIMENSION MERGED WITH THE THREE SPACE DIMENSIONS AS EVERY EVENT IN 3D SPACE 2D HORIZONTALLY AND 1D VERTICALLY ENTAILS A POINT ALONG A 1D TIME AXIS. EVEN IN EVERYDAY LIFE ONE STATES OR IMPLIES BOTH. ONE SAYS OR AT LEAST MEANS MEET ME AT BUILDING 123 MAIN STREET INTERSECTING FRANKLIN STREET IN APARTMENT 3D ON 10 OCTOBER 2012 AT 9 00PM. BY OMITTING OR MISSING THE TIME COORDINATE ONE ARRIVES AT THE CORRECT LOCATION IN SPACE WHEN THE SOUGHT EVENT IS ABSENT IT IS IN THE PAST OR FUTURE AT PERHAPS 6 00PM OR 12 00AM.
BY CONVERGING SPACE AND TIME AND PRESUMING BOTH RELATIVE TO THE ENERGY DENSITY IN THE VICINITY AND BY SETTING THE ONLY CONSTANT OR ABSOLUTE AS NOT EVEN MASS BUT AS LIGHT SPEED IN A VACUUM GENERAL RELATIVITY REVEALED THE NATURAL WORLD S PREVIOUSLY UNIMAGINED BALANCE AND SYMMETRY. EVERY OBJECT IS ALWAYS MOVING AT LIGHT SPEED ALONG A STRAIGHT LINE ITS EQUIVALENT ON A CURVED SURFACE CALLED GEODESIC OR WORLDLINE THE ONE PATHWAY OF LEAST RESISTANCE LIKE A FREE FALL THROUGH 4D SPACETIME WHOSE GEOMETRY CURVES IN THE VICINITY OF MASS ENERGY.
AN OBJECT AT LIGHT SPEED IN A VACUUM IS MOVING AT MAXIMAL RATE THROUGH 3D SPACE BUT EXHIBITS NO EVOLUTION OF EVENTS IT IS FROZEN IN TIME WHEREAS AN OBJECT MOTIONLESS IN 3D SPACE FLOWS FULLY ALONG 1D TIME EXPERIENCING THE MAXIMAL RATE OF EVENTS UNFOLDING. THE DISPLAYED UNIVERSE IS RELATIVE TO A GIVEN LOCATION YET ONCE THE MASS ENERGY IN THAT VICINITY IS STATED EINSTEIN S EQUATIONS PREDICT WHAT IS OCCURRING OR DID OCCUR OR WILL OCCUR ANYWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE. THE POPULARIZED NOTION THAT RELATIVE IN EINSTEIN S THEORY SUGGESTS SUBJECTIVE OR ARBITRARY WAS TO SOME REGRET OF EINSTEIN WHO LATER THOUGHT HE OUGHT HAVE TO NAMED IT GENERAL THEORY.
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD S MESSENGER PARTICLES PHOTONS CARRY AN IMAGE TIMELESSLY ACROSS THE UNIVERSE WHILE OBSERVERS WITHIN THIS FIELD HAVE ENOUGH FLOW THROUGH TIME TO DECODE THIS IMAGE AND REACT BY MOVING WITHIN 3D SPACE YET CAN NEVER OUTRUN THIS TIMELESS IMAGE. THE UNIVERSE S STATE UNDER 400 000 YEARS AFTER THE PRESUMED BIG BANG THAT BEGAN OUR UNIVERSE IS THOUGHT TO BE DISPLAYED AS THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND CMB.
IN 1915 THE UNIVERSE WAS THOUGHT TO BE ENTIRELY WHAT WE NOW CALL THE MILKY WAY GALAXY AND TO BE STATIC. EINSTEIN OPERATED HIS RECENTLY PUBLISHED EQUATIONS OF THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD AND DISCOVERED THE CONSEQUENCE THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS EXPANDING OR SHRINKING. THE THEORY IS OPERABLE IN EITHER DIRECTION TIME INVARIANCE. HE REVISED THE THEORY ADD A COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT TO ARBITRARILY BALANCE THE UNIVERSE. NEARING 1930 EDWIN HUBBLE S TELESCOPIC DATA INTERPRETED THROUGH GENERAL RELATIVITY REVEALED THE UNIVERSE WAS EXPANDING.
IN 1916 WHILE ON A WORLD WAR I BATTLEFIELD KARL SCHWARZSCHILD OPERATED EINSTEIN S EQUATIONS AND THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION PREDICTED BLACK HOLES. DECADES LATER ASTROPHYSICISTS IDENTIFIED A SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE IN THE CENTER OF PERHAPS EVERY GALAXY. BLACK HOLES SEEM TO LEAD GALAXY FORMATION AND MAINTENANCE BY REGULATING STAR FORMATION AND DESTRUCTION.
IN THE 1930S IT WAS NOTICED THAT ACCORDING TO GENERAL RELATIVITY GALAXIES WOULD FALL APART UNLESS SURROUNDED BY INVISIBLE MATTER HOLDING A GALAXY TOGETHER AND BY THE 1970S DARK MATTER BEGAN TO BE ACCEPTED. IN 1998 IT WAS INFERRED THAT THE UNIVERSE S EXPANSION NOT SLOWING IS ACCELERATING INDICATING A VAST ENERGY DENSITY ENOUGH TO ACCELERATE BOTH VISIBLE MATTER AND DARK MATTER THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE A VAST FIELD OF DARK ENERGY. APPARENTLY UNDER 5 OF THE UNIVERSE S COMPOSITION IS KNOWN WHILE THE OTHER 95 IS MYSTERIOUS DARK MATTER AND DARK ENERGY.
BY THE 1920S TO PROBE THE OPERATING OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD AT MINISCULE SCALES OF SPACE AND TIME QUANTUM MECHANICS QM WAS DEVELOPED. YET ELECTRONS THE MATTER PARTICLES THAT INTERACT WITH THE PHOTONS THAT ARE THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD S FORCE CARRIERS WOULD APPEAR TO DEFY MECHANICAL PRINCIPLES ALTOGETHER. NONE COULD PREDICT A QUANTUM PARTICLE S LOCATION FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT.
IN THE SLIT EXPERIMENT AN ELECTRON WOULD TRAVEL THROUGH ONE HOLE PLACED IN FRONT OF IT. YET A SINGLE ELECTRON WOULD TRAVEL SIMULTANEOUSLY THOUGH MULTIPLE HOLES HOWEVER MANY WERE PLACED IN FRONT OF IT. THE SINGLE ELECTRON WOULD LEAVE ON THE DETECTION BOARD AN INTERFERENCE PATTERN AS IF THE SINGLE PARTICLE WERE A WAVE THAT HAD PASSED THROUGH ALL THE HOLES SIMULTANEOUSLY. AND YET THIS OCCURRED ONLY WHEN UNOBSERVED. IF LIGHT WERE SHONE ON THE EXPECTED EVENT THE PHOTON S INTERACTION WITH THE FIELD WOULD SET THE ELECTRON TO A SINGLE POSITION.
BY THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE ANY QUANTUM PARTICLE S EXACT LOCATION AND MOMENTUM CANNOT BE DETERMINED WITH CERTAINTY HOWEVER. THE PARTICLE S INTERACTION WITH THE OBSERVATION MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT DEFLECTS THE PARTICLE SUCH THAT GREATER DETERMINATION OF ITS POSITION YIELDS LOWER DETERMINATION OF ITS MOMENTUM AND VICE VERSA.
BY EXTENDING QUANTUM MECHANICS ACROSS A FIELD A CONSISTENT PATTERN EMERGED. FROM LOCATION TO ADJACENT LOCATION THE PROBABILITY OF THE PARTICLE EXISTING THERE WOULD RISE AND FALL LIKE A WAVE OF PROBABILITY A RISING AND FALLING PROBABILITY DENSITY. WHEN UNOBSERVED ANY QUANTUM PARTICLE ENTERS SUPERPOSITION SUCH THAT EVEN A SINGLE PARTICLE FILLS THE ENTIRE FIELD HOWEVER LARGE. YET THE PARTICLE IS NOT DEFINITELY ANYWHERE IN THE FIELD BUT THERE AT A DEFINITE PROBABILITY IN RELATION TO WHETHER IT WAS HAD BEEN AT THE ADJACENT LOCATION. THE WAVEFORM OF MAXWELL S ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERATED BY AN ACCUMULATION OF PROBABILISTIC EVENTS. NOT THE PARTICLES BUT THE MATHEMATICAL FORM WAS CONSTANT.
SETTING THE FIELD TO SPECIAL RELATIVITY PERMITTED PREDICTION OF THE COMPLETE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD. THUS AROSE RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM FIELD THEORY QFT. OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD IT IS RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS QED. OF THE WEAK AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS TOGETHER IT IS RELATIVISTIC ELECTROWEAK THEORY EWT. OF THE STRONG FIELD IT IS RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM CHROMODYNAMICS QCD. ALTOGETHER THIS BECAME THE STANDARD MODEL OF PARTICLE PHYSICS.
WHEN THE STANDARD MODEL IS SET TO GENERAL RELATIVITY IN ORDER TO INCLUDE MASS PROBABILITY DENSITIES OF INFINITY APPEAR. THIS IS PRESUMED INCORRECT AS PROBABILITY ORDINARILY RANGES FROM 0 TO 1 0 TO 100 PROBABILITY. SOME THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS SUSPECT THAT THE PROBLEM IS IN THE STANDARD MODEL WHICH REPRESENTS EACH PARTICLE BY A ZERO DIMENSIONAL POINT THAT IN PRINCIPLE CAN BE INFINITELY SMALL. YET IN QUANTUM PHYSICS THE PLANCK S CONSTANT IS THE MINIMUM ENERGY UNIT THAT A FIELD CAN BE DIVIDED INTO PERHAPS A CLUE TO THE SMALLEST SIZE A PARTICLE CAN BE. SO THERE IS A QUEST TO QUANTIZE GRAVITY TO DEVELOP A THEORY OF QUANTUM GRAVITY.
STRING CONJECTURES THAT ON THE MICROSCOPIC SCALE EINSTEIN S 4D SPACETIME IS A FIELD OF CALABI YAU MANIFOLDS EACH CONTAINING 6 SPACE DIMENSIONS CURLED UP THUS NOT EXTENDED INTO THE 3 SPACE DIMENSIONS PRESENTED TO THE CLASSICAL REALM. IN STRING THEORY EACH QUANTUM PARTICLE IS REPLACED BY A 1D STRING OF VIBRATING ENERGY WHOSE LENGTH IS THE PLANCK LENGTH. AS THE STRING MOVES IT TRACES WIDTH AND THUS BECOMES 2D A WORLDSHEET. AS A STRING VIBRATES AND MOVES WITHIN THE 6D CALABI YAU SPACE THE STRING BECOMES A QUANTUM PARTICLE. WITH THIS APPROACH THE HYPOTHETICAL GRAVITON PREDICTED TO EXPLAIN GENERAL RELATIVITY EMERGES EASILY.
STRING THEORY BEGAN AS BOSONIC STRING THEORY WHOSE 26 DIMENSIONS ACT AS MANY FEWER. YET THIS MODELED ONLY BOSONS WHICH ARE ENERGY PARTICLES WHILE OMITTING FERMIONS WHICH ARE MATTER PARTICLES. SO BOSONIC STRING THEORY COULD NOT EXPLAIN MATTER. YET BY ADDING SUPERSYMMETRY TO BOSONIC STRING THEORY FERMIONS WERE ACHIEVED AND STRING THEORY BECAME SUPER STRING THEORY EXPLAINING MATTER TOO.
STRING THEORY S CLAIM THAT ALL MOLECULES ARE STRINGS OF ENERGY HAS DRAWN HARSH CRITICISM. THERE ARE MANY VERSIONS OF STRING THEORY NONE QUITE SUCCESSFULLY PREDICTING THE OBSERVATIONAL DATA EXPLAINED BY THE STANDARD MODEL. M THEORY IS NOW KNOWN TO HAVE COUNTLESS SOLUTIONS OFTEN PREDICTING THINGS STRANGE AND UNKNOWN TO EXIST. SOME ALLEGE THAT STRING THEORISTS SELECT ONLY THE DESIRED PREDICTIONS.
THE ALLEGATION THAT STRING THEORY MAKES NO TESTABLE PREDICTIONS IS FALSE AS IT MAKES MANY. NO THEORY A PREDICTIVE AND PERHAPS EXPLANATORY MODEL OF SOME DOMAIN OF NATURAL PHENOMENA IS VERIFIABLE. ALL CONVENTIONAL PHYSICAL THEORIES UNTIL THE STANDARD MODEL HAVE MADE CLAIMS ABOUT UNOBSERVABLE ASPECTS OF THE NATURAL WORLD. EVEN THE STANDARD MODEL HAS VARIOUS INTERPRETATIONS AS TO THE NATURAL WORLD. WHEN THE STANDARD MODEL IS OPERATED IT IS OFTEN MADE A VERSION WITH SUPERSYMMETRY DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF PARTICLE SPECIES SO FAR IDENTIFIED BY PARTICLE PHYSICISTS.
NONE CAN LITERALLY MEASURE SPACE YET NEWTON POSTULATED ABSOLUTE SPACE AND TIME AND NEWTON S THEORY MADE EXPLICIT PREDICTIONS HIGHLY TESTABLE AND PREDICTIVELY SUCCESSFUL FOR 200 YEARS BUT THE THEORY WAS STILL FALSIFIED AS EXPLANATORY OF NATURE. PHYSICISTS ACCEPT THAT THERE EXISTS NO SUCH ATTRACTIVE FORCE DIRECTLY ATTRACTING MATTER TO MATTER LET ALONE THAT THE FORCE TRAVERSES THE UNIVERSE INSTANTLY. AND YET NEWTON S THEORY IS STILL PARADIGMATIC OF SCIENCE EVEN MORE SCIENTIFIC THAN THE VERY FRAMEWORK OF MODERNIST BIOLOGY THE MODERN EVOLUTIONARY SYNTHESIS.
THE IDEA OF HIDDEN DIMENSIONALITY OF SPACE CAN SEEM OCCULT. SOME THEORISTS OF LOOP QUANTUM GRAVITY A CONTENDER FOR QUANTUM GRAVITY REGARD STRING THEORY AS FUNDAMENTALLY MISGUIDED BY PRESUMING THAT SPACE EVEN HAS A SHAPE UNTIL PARTICLES SHAPE IT. THAT IS THEY DO NOT DOUBT THAT SPACE TAKES VARIOUS SHAPES SIMPLY REGARD THE PARTICLES AS DETERMINING SPACE S SHAPE NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. THE SPACETIME VORTEX PREDICTED BY GENERAL RELATIVITY IS APPARENTLY CONFIRMED.
IF INTERPRETED AS NATURALLY TRUE THE STANDARD MODEL REPRESENTING A QUANTUM PARTICLE AS A 0D POINT ALREADY INDICATES THAT SPACETIME IS A SEA OF ROILING SHAPES QUANTUM FOAM. STRING THEORISTS TEND TO BELIEVE NATURE MORE ELEGANT A BELIEF THAT LOOP THEORIST LEE SMOLIN DISMISSES AS ROMANTIC WHILE USING BIOLOGY S MODERN SYNTHESIS AS A RHETORICAL DEVICE. EXPERIMENTS TO DETECT ADDED SPATIAL DIMENSIONS HAVE SO FAR FAILED YET THERE IS STILL THE POSSIBILITY THAT SIGNS OF THEM CAN EMERGE.
M THEORY HAS MANY TRILLIONS OF SOLUTIONS. LEONARD SUSSKIND A LEADER OF STRING THEORY INTERPRETS STRING THEORY S PLASTICITY OF SOLUTIONS AS PARADOXICAL SUPPORT RESOLVING THE MYSTERY OF WHY THIS UNIVERSE EXISTS AS M THEORY SHOWS IT BUT A VARIANT OF A GENERAL PATTERN THAT ALWAYS APPROXIMATELY RESULTS.
GENERAL RELATIVITY HAS BROUGHT MANY DISCOVERIES THAT IN 1915 WERE ALL BUT UNIMAGINABLE EXCEPT IN FICTION. A SOLUTION OF EINSTEIN S EQUATIONS THAT SOUGHT TO EXPLAIN QUANTUM PARTICLES DYNAMICS THE EINSTEIN ROSEN BRIDGE PREDICTS A SHORTCUT CONNECTING TWO DISTANT POINTS IN SPACETIME. COMMONLY CALLED A WORMHOLE THE EINSTEIN ROSEN BRIDGE IS DOUBTED BUT NOT DISPROVED SHOWING EITHER THAT NOT ALL CONSEQUENCES OF A THEORY MUST BE ACCURATE OR THAT REALITY IS QUITE BIZARRE IN WAYS UNOBSERVABLE.
EVEN THE STANDARD MODEL OF PARTICLE PHYSICS SUGGESTS BIZARRE POSSIBILITIES THAT POPULIST ACCOUNTS OF SCIENCE EITHER OMIT OR MENTION AS UNEXPLAINED CURIOSITIES. THE THEORY CONVENTIONALLY RECEIVES THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION WHEREBY THE FIELD IS ONLY POSSIBILITIES NONE REAL UNTIL AN OBSERVER OR INSTRUMENT INTERACTS WITH THE FIELD WHOSE WAVEFUNCTION THEN COLLAPSES AND LEAVES ONLY ITS PARTICLE FUNCTION ONLY THE PARTICLES BEING REAL. YET WAVEFUNCTION COLLAPSE WAS MERELY ASSUMED NEITHER EXPERIMENTALLY CONFIRMED NOR EVEN MATHEMATICALLY MODELED AND NO VARIANCE FROM EITHER THE WAVEFUNCTION IN THE QUANTUM REALM OR THE PARTICLE FUNCTION IN THE CLASSICAL REALM HAS BEEN FOUND.
IN 1957 HUGH EVERETT DESCRIBED HIS RELATIVE STATE INTERPRETATION. EVERETT MAINTAINED THAT THE WAVEFUNCTION DOES NOT COLLAPSE AND SINCE ALL MATTER AND INTERACTIONS ARE PRESUMED TO BE BUILT UP FROM QUANTUM WAVEPARTICLES ALL POSSIBLE VARIATIONS OF THE QUANTUM FIELD INDICATED BY THE MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS ARE REAL AND SIMULTANEOUSLY OCCURRING BUT DIFFERENT COURSES OF HISTORY. BY THIS INTERPRETATION WHATEVER INTERACTS WITH THE FIELD JOINS THE FIELD S STATE THAT IS RELATIVE TO THE OBSERVER S STATE ITSELF A WAVEFORM IN ITS OWN QUANTUM FIELD WHILE THE TWO SIMPLY INTERACT IN A UNIVERSAL WAVEFORM NEVER COLLAPSING. BY NOW MANY PHYSICISTS INTERPRETATION OF THE APPARENT TRANSITION FROM THE QUANTUM TO THE CLASSICAL REALMS IS NOT WAVEFUNCTION COLLAPSE BUT QUANTUM DECOHERENCE.
IN DECOHERENCE AN INTERACTION WITH THE FIELD TAKES THE OBSERVER INTO ONLY ONE DETERMINANT CONSTELLATION OF THE QUANTUM FIELD AND SO ALL OBSERVATIONS ALIGN WITH THAT NEW COMBINED QUANTUM STATE. EVERETT S THESIS HAS INSPIRED MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION WHEREBY WITHIN OUR UNIVERSE ARE PREDICTED TO BE VIRTUALLY OR POTENTIALLY INFINITE PARALLEL WORLDS THAT ARE REAL YET EACH A MINUSCULE DISTANCE FROM THE OTHER WORLDS. AS EACH WORLD S WAVEFORM IS UNIVERSAL NOT COLLAPSING AND ITS MATHEMATICAL RELATIONS ARE INVARIANT PARALLEL WORLDS SIMPLY FILL THE GAPS AND DO NOT TOUCH.
EINSTEIN DOUBTED THAT BLACK HOLES AS PREDICTED BY THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION ARE REAL. SOME NOW CONJECTURE THAT BLACK HOLES DO NOT EXIST AS SUCH BUT ARE DARK ENERGY OR THAT OUR UNIVERSE IS BOTH A BLACK HOLE AND DARK ENERGY. THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION OF EINSTEIN S EQUATIONS CAN BE MAXIMALLY EXTENDED TO PREDICT A BLACK HOLE HAVING A FLIP SIDE ANOTHER UNIVERSE EMERGING FROM A WHITE HOLE. PERHAPS OUR UNIVERSE S BIG BANG WAS HALF OF A BIG BOUNCE SOMETHING S COLLAPSE DOWN TO A BLACK HOLE AND OUR UNIVERSE POPPING OUT ITS OTHER SIDE AS A WHITE HOLE.
PHYSICISTS WIDELY DOUBT THAT QUANTUM PARTICLES ARE TRULY 0D POINTS AS REPRESENTED IN STANDARD MODEL WHICH OFFERS FORMALISM MATHEMATICAL DEVICES WHOSE STROKES PREDICT PHENOMENA OF INTEREST UPON INPUT OF DATA NOT INTERPRETATION OF THE MECHANISMS DETERMINING THOSE PHENOMENA. YET STRING THEORISTS DO TEND TO OPTIMISTICALLY CONJECTURE THAT THE STRINGS ARE BOTH REAL AND EXPLANATORY NOT MERELY PREDICTIVE DEVICES. IT IS FAR BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF TODAY S PARTICLE ACCELERATORS TO PROPEL ANY PROBING PARTICLES AT ENERGY LEVELS HIGH ENOUGH TO OVERCOME A QUANTUM PARTICLE S OWN ENERGY AND DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS A STRING. YET THIS LIMITATION ALSO EXISTS ON TESTING OTHER THEORIES OF QUANTUM GRAVITY. DEVELOPMENTS SUGGEST OTHER STRATEGIES TO OBSERVE THE STRUCTURE OF QUANTUM PARTICLES.
PARADOXICALLY EVEN IF TESTING CONFIRMED THAT PARTICLES ARE STRINGS OF ENERGY THAT STILL WOULD NOT CONCLUSIVELY PROVE EVEN THAT PARTICLES ARE STRINGS SINCE THERE COULD BE OTHER EXPLANATIONS PERHAPS AN UNEXPECTED WARPAGE OF SPACE ALTHOUGH THE PARTICLE WAS A 0D POINT OF TRUE SOLIDITY. EVEN WHEN PREDICTIONS SUCCEED THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS THE PROBLEM OF UNDERDETERMINATION AND PHILOSOPHERS OF SCIENCE AS WELL AS SOME SCIENTISTS DO NOT ACCEPT EVEN FLAWLESS PREDICTIVE SUCCESS AS VERIFICATION OF THE SUCCESSFUL THEORY S EXPLANATIONS IF THESE ARE POSED AS OFFERING SCIENTIFIC REALISM TRUE DESCRIPTION OF THE NATURAL WORLD.
TALK OF PARTICLE PHYSICISTS TESTING THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS PREDICTED PARTICLES BY COLLIDING PARTICLES IN ACCELERATORS SUGGESTS THAT QUANTUM PARTICLES ARE TINY NEWTONIAN PARTICLES THAT EXPERIMENTALISTS CRACK OPEN TO REVEAL THEIR STRUCTURE. INSTEAD WHEN TWO PARTICLES EACH OF A CERTAIN MASS MEASURED IN TERMS OF ENERGY AS ELECTRONVOLTS ARE COLLIDED THEY CAN COMBINE INTO A PARTICLE OF THAT COMBINED MASS ENERGY AND THE GENERATED PARTICLE IS OBSERVED FOR CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE PREDICTION.
IT IS NOT CONTROVERSIAL AMONG PHYSICISTS THAT ALL PARTICLES ARE ENERGY. LOOP THEORISTS SOMETIMES IN RIVALRY WITH STRING THEORY CLAIM THAT SPACETIME ITSELF CONVERTS INTO THE PARTICLES. MATTER S BEING A SPECIAL VARIANT OF ENERGY WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF EINSTEIN S SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY AND THEREUPON EINSTEIN FORMALIZED THE MASS ENERGY EQUIVALENCE E MC. WHEN SUFFICIENTLY ENERGETIC PHOTONS COLLIDE THEY CAN COMBINE AND GENERATE MATTER MATTER CREATION. ALL PARTICLES HAVE ANTIPARTICLES AND ATOMS OF MATTER HAVE ANTIATOMS OF ANTIMATTER WHOSE UNION ANNIHILATES THE PARTICLES AND MATTER WHILE LEAVING ENERGY.
AN INSPIRING DEVELOPMENT IS DISCOVERY OF MIRROR SYMMETRY WHEREBY CALABI YAU SPACES TEND TO COME IN PAIRS SUCH THAT SOLUTIONS PREVIOUSLY DIFFICULT WITHIN THE EXTREME VIBRATIONAL MODE OF ONE STRING CAN BE SOLVED BY THROUGH THE MIRROR CALABI YAU SPACE S GEOMETRY IN ITS OPPOSITE RANGE.
STRING THEORY IS USUALLY SOLVED THROUGH CONFORMAL FIELD THEORY A QUANTUM FIELD THEORY ON 2D SPACE. IT IS CONFIRMED THAT MOLECULES CAN COLLAPSE TO 2D. AND THE ELECTRON LONG PRESUMED AN ELEMENTARY PARTICLE APPARENTLY SPLITS INTO THREE ENTITIES SEPARATELY CARRYING THE ELECTRON S THREE DEGREES OF FREEDOM WHEN THE MOLECULES THAT CONTAIN THE ELECTRONS ARE CHANNELED THROUGH A 1D PATHWAY.
TORNADO
A TORNADO IS A TUBE OF VIOLENTLY SPINNING AIR THAT TOUCHES THE GROUND. WIND INSIDE THE TORNADO SPINS FAST BUT THE ACTUAL CIRCLE OF WIND AROUND THEM IS HUGE. THIS MAKES TORNADOES VERY DANGEROUS. TORNADOES ARE ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS TO PEOPLE IN CARS OR MOBILE HOMES AND ABOUT 60 PEOPLE ARE KILLED BY TORNADOES EVERY YEAR.
TORNADOES ARE DEVASTATING AS THEY CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT INJURY AND DEATH. TORNADOES CAN TEAR THROUGH HOUSES AND OFTEN LEAVE PEOPLE HOMELESS. TORNADOES CAN BE CAUSED BY WINDS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS WITH MOIST AIR MEET AS WELL AS HURRICANES. NEARLY 3 QUARTERS OF THE WORLDS TORNADOES TAKES PLACE IN THE US.
TORNADOES MOSTLY HAPPEN DURING STRONG THUNDERSTORMS CALLED SUPER CELL STORMS. THEY CAUSE A LOT OF DAMAGE TO ANYTHING IN THEIR PATH. TORNADOES ARE RANKED ON THE FUJITA SCALE FROM F0 TO F5. F0 FOR TORNADOS THAT CAUSED THE LEAST DAMAGE AND F5 FOR THE ONES THAT CAUSED THE MOST.
TORNADOES CAN HAPPEN IN NEARLY ANY PART OF THE WORLD. IN THE UNITED STATES A TORNADO HAS HAPPENED IN ALL STATES. THE MIDDLE PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS NICKNAMED TORNADO ALLEY FOR THE NUMBER OF TORNADOES THERE. A TORNADO CAN HAVE WIND SPEEDS OF OVER 300 MILES PER HOUR 480 KM H. MOST TORNADOES HAVE WIND SPEEDS LESS THAN 110 MILES PER HOUR 180 KM H ARE ABOUT 250 FEET 80 M ACROSS AND TRAVEL A FEW MILES BEFORE DISAPPEARING. OTHER TORNADO LIKE PHENOMENA THAT EXIST IN NATURE INCLUDE THE GUSTNADO DUST DEVIL FIRE WHIRLS AND STEAM DEVIL DOWNBURSTS ARE FREQUENTLY CONFUSED WITH TORNADOES THOUGH THEIR ACTION IS NOT SIMILAR.
A TORNADO DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEED TO BE VISIBLE HOWEVER THE EXTREMELY LOW PRESSURE CAUSED BY THE HIGH WIND SPEEDS AND RAPID ROTATION USUALLY CAUSES WATER VAPOR IN THE AIR TO CONDENSE INTO A VISIBLE CONDENSATION FUNNEL. THE TORNADO IS THE VORTEX OF WIND NOT THE CONDENSATION CLOUD.
A SINGLE STORM MAY PRODUCE MULTIPLE TORNADOES AND MESOCYCLONES. TORNADOES PRODUCED FROM THE SAME STORM ARE REFERRED TO AS A TORNADO FAMILY. SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TORNADOES FROM DISTINCT MESOCYCLONES OCCUR AT THE SAME TIME.
OCCASIONALLY SEVERAL TORNADOES ARE SPAWNED FROM THE SAME VERY LARGE STORM. IF THERE IS NO BREAK IN THEIR ACTIVITY THIS IS CONSIDERED A TORNADO OUTBREAK ALTHOUGH THERE ARE VARIOUS DEFINITIONS. A PERIOD OF SEVERAL SUCCESSIVE DAYS WITH TORNADO OUTBREAKS IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA SPAWNED BY MULTIPLE WEATHER SYSTEMS IS A TORNADO OUTBREAK SEQUENCE OCCASIONALLY CALLED AN EXTENDED TORNADO OUTBREAK.
SOMETIMES TORNADOES HAPPEN IN GROUPS. 148 TORNADOES STRUCK ON THE SAME DAY IN APRIL 1974. MANY TOWNS IN THE MIDWESTERN UNITED STATES AND CANADA WERE DESTROYED. MORE THAN 300 PEOPLE DIED. THEY WERE HIT BY FLYING WRECKS BURIED UNDER HOUSES AND THROWN BY POWERFUL WINDS. THAT DAY STUDENTS IN XENIA OHIO WERE PRACTICING FOR A PLAY ON THE AUDITORIUM STAGE. ONE GIRL LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND SAW THE TORNADO. THE STUDENTS RAN INTO THE HALL COVERING THEIR HEADS. A FEW SECONDS LATER ALL THE SCHOOL BUSES FLEW RIGHT ONTO THE STAGE.
A MAN IN ANOTHER TOWN HID UNDER THE COUCH IN HIS LIVING ROOM. HE HELD ONTO ONE COUCH LEG. THE TORNADO STRUCK HIS HOUSE AND WINDS BLEW AROUND HIM. WHEN THE TORNADO LEFT HE WAS OUTSIDE. THERE WAS NO HOUSE. THE COUCH HAD DISAPPEARED AND HE WAS ONLY HOLDING ONTO ONE COUCH LEG.
A TORNADO WATCH IS GIVEN WHEN THE WEATHER CONDITIONS LOOK LIKE A TORNADO COULD FORM. A PDS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION WATCH IS GIVEN WHEN A LIKELY TORNADO OUTBREAK IS TO START MANY STRONG TORNADOES WILL FORM IN THE AREA OR AN ONGOING TORNADO OUTBREAK IS IN THE WORKS IN THE AREA. A TORNADO WARNING IS GIVEN IF SOMEBODY HAS ACTUALLY SEEN A TORNADO OR IF A TORNADO SIGNATURE USUALLY THE STORM HAS A HOOK OR U ECHO HAS SHOWN UP ON RADAR. TORNADO EMERGENCIES ARE ISSUED IN SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENTS OR TORNADO WARNINGS SAYING THAT A POWERFUL TORNADO IS ABOUT TO HIT AN AREA WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE IN IT ESPECIALLY CITIES IN TORNADO ALLEY A TORNADO HAS BEEN SPOTTED AND THE TORNADO IS EXPECTED TO CAUSE DEATHS.
TO KEEP SAFE IN A TORNADO HERE ARE SOME TIPS YOU CAN FOLLOW 
TREATY OF VERSAILLES
THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES WAS A PEACE TREATY BETWEEN THE NATIONS OF JAPAN THE UNITED STATES FRANCE AUSTRIA HUNGARY GERMANY AND BRITAIN AFTER WORLD WAR I. THE TREATY WAS MADE IN 1919. GERMANY AUSTRIA AND HUNGARY DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN WRITING IT. GERMANY HAD THE CHOICE BETWEEN SIGNING IT OR FACING THE OCCUPATION OF GERMANY BY ALLIED TROOPS. 
THE FRENCH MADE THE TREATY HARD FOR THE GERMANS SO THAT GERMANY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO START A NEW WAR. THUS GERMANY HAD TO REDUCE ITS ARMED FORCES FROM 6 MILLION TO 100 000 MEN AND GET RID OF ITS SUBMARINES MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MOST OF THEIR ARTILLERY. THEIR NAVY BATTLESHIPS WERE LIMITED TO ONLY SIX SMALL ONES. 
GERMANY ALSO HAD TO GIVE BACK FRENCH TERRITORIES IT HAD OCCUPIED AS WELL AS LARGE TERRITORIES OF ITS OWN TO POLAND AND OTHER NEIGHBOURS AND IT HAD TO GIVE UP ALL OF ITS COLONIES TO THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. GERMANY WAS TO PAY BACK THE VERY BIG WORLD WAR I REPARATIONS FOR THE DAMAGE DONE TO ALLIED COUNTRIES MOSTLY FRANCE DURING WORLD WAR I BY GERMAN TROOPS. THIS SUM WAS TO BE VERY LARGE BUT WAS NOT YET FIXED. 132 BILLION GOLD MARKS HAD TO BE PAID ONLY AS A FIRST PART OF THE GERMAN DEBT. 
THE TREATY MADE A LEAGUE OF NATIONS WHICH WAS INTENDED TO MAKE DECISIONS AND KEEP PEACE AFTER THE TREATY WAS SIGNED. THE LEAGUE SOLVED SOME INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES WITHOUT WAR BUT COULD NOT STOP WORLD WAR II.
THIS TREATY CAN BE SEEN AS A ONE SIDED PEACE DICTATED TO GERMANY. THE ENGLISH ECONOMIST JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT MISTAKE TO FORCE SUCH HARSH MEASURES ON THE GERMAN PEOPLE BUT HIS ADVICE WAS IGNORED. GERMANY SET UP THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC. IT WAS DEMOCRATIC BUT SUFFERED AN ECONOMIC COLLAPSE WITH THE HYPER INFLATION OF ITS CURRENCY. ADOLF HITLER BECAME CHANCELLOR AND OVERRULED THE TREATY. HIS ACTIONS EVENTUALLY LED TO WORLD WAR II.
GERMANY HAD TO GIVE BACK FRENCH AREAS ALSACE LORRAINE TAKEN BY GERMANY IN THE FRANCO PRUSSIAN WAR THAT GERMANY HAD WON IN 1871 AND WAS STILL AN EMBARRASSMENT FOR FRANCE. THE FRENCH MADE GERMANY TAKE ITS TROOPS OUT OF THE RHINELAND THE LONG STRETCH OF LAND ON GERMANY S BORDER WITH FRANCE WHERE THE RHINE RIVER FLOWS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LAND FOR GERMANY WHERE MANY FACTORIES AND BUSINESSES EXISTED. IF GERMANY PUT TROOPS BACK INTO THE RHINELAND THE PUNISHMENT WOULD BE FRANCE INVADING GERMANY.
GERMANY ALSO HAD TO GIVE PARTS TO POLAND A COUNTRY MADE OUT OF RUSSIAN AND AUSTRIAN PARTS AND THE POLISH AND LITHUANIAN PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THEM. POLAND WAS A STRONG KINGDOM A FEW HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE BUT AUSTRIA PRUSSIA AND RUSSIA HAD SPLIT IT IN THE PARTITIONS OF POLAND.
BELGIUM WAS GIVEN MORESNET AND EUPEN AND MALMEDY. THIS IS THE MAIN REASON THAT BELGIUM NOW HAS A GERMAN SPEAKING COMMUNITY.
VERSAILLES ALSO SPLIT UP MANY LARGE EMPIRES ON THE LOSING SIDE. THE U.S. PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON THOUGHT THIS WAS A VERY GOOD IDEA BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE IN EUROPE WANTED TO BE FREE FROM THE BIG EMPIRES. BUT IT ALSO CREATED PROBLEMS.
IN A SEPARATE TREATY AROUND THE SAME TIME AUSTRIA HUNGARY WAS SPLIT INTO MANY COUNTRIES. ONE WAS AUSTRIA. AUSTRIA WAS MEANT TO BE THE HOMELAND OF THE AUSTRIANS WHO SPOKE GERMAN AND MAINLY RULED AUSTRIA HUNGARY. ITS CAPITAL WAS VIENNA. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF VERSAILLES WAS THAT MANY AUSTRIANS LIKE ADOLF HITLER THOUGHT THAT AUSTRIA WAS MEANT TO BE PART OF GERMANY. THIS LATER LED TO THE NAZI GERMAN OCCUPATION OF AUSTRIA.
THE NEW COUNTRY OF HUNGARY WAS ALSO CREATED. LIKE POLAND IT WAS A COUNTRY THAT WAS STRONG ON ITS OWN CENTURIES BEFORE. ITS CAPITAL WAS BUDAPEST. ANOTHER NEW COUNTRY CZECHOSLOVAKIA WAS CREATED TO BE THE HOMELAND OF THE CZECHS AND SLOVAKS. THE CZECH PART WAS MADE UP OF THE COUNTRY ONCE CALLED BOHEMIA AND MORAVIA. ITS CAPITAL WAS PRAGUE. MANY GERMANS LIVED ON ITS BORDERS CALLED THE SUDETENLAND WHICH WAS WHY LATER ADOLF HITLER INSISTED THAT IT SHOULD BELONG TO GERMANY.
BOSNIA SLOVENIA CROATIA WHICH WERE PARTS OF AUSTRIA HUNGARY NORTHERN MACEDONIA WHICH WAS PART OF BULGARIA SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO MADE ONE COUNTRY CALLED YUGOSLAVIA. IT WAS MADE TO BE A SLAV HOMELAND BUT THERE WERE MANY RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE AND NATIONAL DIFFERENCES.
NEW COUNTRIES BY THE BALTIC SEA CALLED ESTONIA FINLAND LATVIA AND LITHUANIA WERE ALSO CREATED IN OTHER TREATIES AFTER WORLD WAR ONE. THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION STARTED DURING THE WAR AND LATER RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF TZAR NICHOLAS II OF RUSSIA AND THE FORMATION OF A COMMUNIST STATE. A CIVIL WAR RAGED IN RUSSIA BETWEEN THE ANTI COMMUNIST WHITE RUSSIANS AND PRO SOVIET RED RUSSIANS. RUSSIA HAD LOST CONTROL OF ITS WESTERN TERRITORY WHICH MADE UP ESTONIA FINLAND LATVIA LITHUANIA AND PARTS OF POLAND. LATER DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR THE SOVIET UNION WOULD RECLAIM ESTONIA LATVIA LITHUANIA AND HALF OF POLAND.
ANOTHER TREATY CALLED THE TREATY OF S VRES GAVE PARTS THE DEFEATED OTTOMAN EMPIRE TO THE VARIOUS VICTORS. HOWEVER GREEK AND TURKISH ARMIES SOON RESUMED FIGHTING.
THE GERMAN EMPIRE BECAME THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC. A BIG PROBLEM FOR GERMANY WAS TO PAY BACK A GIANT AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THE ALL OF THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE ALLIED COUNTRIES MOSTLY FRANCE DURING WORLD WAR I. THIS MADE GERMANY ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN EUROPE FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS AND CAUSED POLITICAL FIGHTING IN GERMANY. THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT PARTIES THE COMMUNISTS WHO WANTED A COMMUNIST REVOLUTION AS HAD HAPPENED IN RUSSIA AND THE NAZIS WHO THOUGHT GERMANY SHOULD BECOME THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY IN EUROPE FOUGHT FOR MANY YEARS.
THE DEBT TO THE ALLIES WAS MADE EASIER FOR THE GERMANS DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND ALL DEBT WAS CANCELLED IN 1932. MANY GERMANS HATED THE TREATY AND SOME EVEN WANTED TO FIGHT MORE AFTER VERSAILLES.
THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS CREATED AFTER VERSAILLES WAS USUALLY NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO STOP WARS EITHER. JAPAN TOOK A PART OF CHINA CALLED MANCHURIA AND THE LEAGUE WAS NOT ABLE TO STOP IT. ITALY INVADED ETHIOPIA AND ALTHOUGH THE ETHIOPIAN EMPEROR BEGGED THE LEAGUE TO HELP HIM IT DID NOT. GERMANY JAPAN AND ITALY BECAME THE AXIS POWERS AND BY INVADING MANY PEACEFUL COUNTRIES CAUSED WORLD WAR II. THE UNITED STATES AND THE USSR DID NOT EVEN JOIN THE LEAGUE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE IDEA OF US PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE LEAGUE WAS NEVER TAKEN SERIOUSLY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS CREATED TO MAKE SURE VERSAILLES WAS RESPECTED. 
THE TREATY FAILED TO KEEP PEACE IN THE END AND WAS A REASON FOR NAZI GERMANY AND ADOLF HITLER TO WIN THE SUPPORT OF THE POORER GERMANS TO GET RID OF THE CHAINS OF VERSAILLES LEADING TO WORLD WAR II.
HITLER HAD TWO MAJOR GOALS TO CREATE A POWERFUL NEW GERMAN EMPIRE AND TO RID THE COUNTRY OF JEWS. DURING HIS FIRST THREE YEARS IN POWER HITLER CHANGED GERMANY FROM A POOR DEFEATED ASHAMED NATION INTO A PROUD COUNTRY WITH A POWERFUL NEW ARMY. UNDER THE VERSAILLES TREATY THE GERMAN ARMY WAS LIMITED TO 100 000 MEN BUT HITLER SCORNED THE TREATY. BY 1936 HIS ARMY TOTALED AROUND 400 000. THAT WAS THE FIRST ACTION THAT LED THE TREATY TO BE BROKEN.

TREE
A TREE IS A TALL PLANT WITH A TRUNK AND BRANCHES MADE OF WOOD. TREES CAN LIVE FOR MANY YEARS. THE OLDEST TREE EVER DISCOVERED IS APPROXIMATELY 5 000 YEARS OLD. THE FOUR MAIN PARTS OF A TREE ARE THE ROOTS THE TRUNK THE BRANCHES AND THE LEAVES.
THE ROOTS OF A TREE ARE USUALLY UNDER THE GROUND. ONE CASE FOR WHICH THIS IS NOT TRUE ARE THE ROOTS OF THE MANGROVE TREE WHICH ARE OFTEN UNDER WATER. A SINGLE TREE HAS MANY ROOTS. THE ROOTS CARRY FOOD AND WATER FROM THE GROUND THROUGH THE TRUNK AND BRANCHES TO THE LEAVES OF THE TREE. THEY CAN ALSO BREATHE IN AIR. SOMETIMES ROOTS ARE SPECIALIZED INTO AERIAL ROOTS WHICH CAN ALSO PROVIDE SUPPORT AS IS THE CASE WITH THE BANYAN TREE.
THE TRUNK IS THE MAIN BODY OF THE TREE. THE TRUNK IS COVERED WITH BARK WHICH PROTECTS IT FROM DAMAGE. BRANCHES GROW FROM THE TRUNK. THEY SPREAD OUT SO THAT THE LEAVES CAN GET MORE SUNLIGHT.
THE LEAVES OF A TREE ARE GREEN MOST OF THE TIME BUT THEY CAN COME IN MANY COLOURS SHAPES AND SIZES. THE LEAVES TAKE IN SUNLIGHT AND USE WATER AND FOOD FROM THE ROOTS TO MAKE THE TREE GROW AND TO REPRODUCE.
TREES AND SHRUBS TAKE IN WATER AND CARBON DIOXIDE AND GIVE OUT OXYGEN WITH SUNLIGHT TO FORM SUGARS. THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT ANIMALS DO IN RESPIRATION. PLANTS ALSO DO SOME RESPIRATION USING OXYGEN THE WAY ANIMALS DO. THEY NEED OXYGEN AS WELL AS CARBON DIOXIDE TO LIVE.
THE PARTS OF A TREE ARE THE ROOTS TRUNK S BRANCHES TWIGS AND LEAVES. TREE STEMS ARE MAINLY MADE OF SUPPORT AND TRANSPORT TISSUES XYLEM AND PHLOEM. WOOD CONSISTS OF XYLEM CELLS AND BARK IS MADE OF PHLOEM AND OTHER TISSUES EXTERNAL TO THE VASCULAR CAMBIUM.
AS A TREE GROWS IT MAY PRODUCE GROWTH RINGS AS NEW WOOD IS LAID DOWN AROUND THE OLD WOOD. IN AREAS WITH SEASONAL CLIMATE WOOD PRODUCED AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE YEAR MAY ALTERNATE LIGHT AND DARK RINGS. IN TEMPERATE CLIMATES AND TROPICAL CLIMATES WITH A SINGLE WET DRY SEASON ALTERNATION THE GROWTH RINGS ARE ANNUAL EACH PAIR OF LIGHT AND DARK RINGS BEING ONE YEAR OF GROWTH. IN AREAS WITH TWO WET AND DRY SEASONS EACH YEAR THERE MAY BE TWO PAIRS OF LIGHT AND DARK RINGS EACH YEAR AND IN SOME MAINLY SEMI DESERT REGIONS WITH IRREGULAR RAINFALL THERE MAY BE A NEW GROWTH RING WITH EACH RAINFALL.
IN TROPICAL RAINFOREST REGIONS WITH CONSTANT YEAR ROUND CLIMATE GROWTH IS CONTINUOUS. GROWTH RINGS ARE NOT VISIBLE AND THERE IS NO CHANGE IN THE WOOD TEXTURE. IN SPECIES WITH ANNUAL RINGS THESE RINGS CAN BE COUNTED TO FIND THE AGE OF THE TREE. THIS WAY WOOD TAKEN FROM TREES IN THE PAST CAN BE DATED BECAUSE THE PATTERNS OF RING THICKNESS ARE VERY DISTINCTIVE. THIS IS DENDROCHRONOLOGY. VERY FEW TROPICAL TREES CAN BE ACCURATELY DATED IN THIS MANNER.
THE ROOTS OF A TREE ARE GENERALLY DOWN IN EARTH PROVIDING FOR THE PARTS ABOVE GROUND AND TAKING IN WATER AND NUTRIENTS FROM THE SOIL. MOST TREES NEED HELP FROM A FUNGUS FOR BETTER UPTAKE OF NUTRIENS THIS IS MYCORRHIZA. MOST OF A TREE S BIOMASS COMES FROM CARBON DIOXIDE ABSORBED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE SEE PHOTOSYNTHESIS. ABOVE GROUND THE TRUNK GIVES HEIGHT TO THE LEAF BEARING BRANCHES COMPETING WITH OTHER PLANT SPECIES FOR SUNLIGHT. IN MANY TREES THE ORDER OF THE BRANCHES MAKES EXPOSURE OF THE LEAVES TO SUNLIGHT BETTER.
NOT ALL TREES HAVE ALL THE ORGANS OR PARTS AS MENTIONED ABOVE. FOR EXAMPLE MOST PALM TREES ARE NOT BRANCHED THE SAGUARO CACTUS OF NORTH AMERICA HAS NO FUNCTIONAL LEAVES TREE FERNS DO NOT PRODUCE BARK ETC. BASED ON THEIR GENERAL SHAPE AND SIZE ALL OF THESE ARE NONETHELESS GENERALLY REGARDED AS TREES. TREES CAN VARY VERY MUCH. A PLANT FORM THAT IS SIMILAR TO A TREE BUT GENERALLY HAVING SMALLER MULTIPLE TRUNKS AND OR BRANCHES THAT ARISE NEAR THE GROUND IS CALLED A SHRUB OR A BUSH. EVEN THOUGH THAT IS TRUE NO PRECISE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN SHRUBS AND TREES IS POSSIBLE. GIVEN THEIR SMALL SIZE BONSAI PLANTS WOULD NOT TECHNICALLY BE TREES BUT ONE SHOULD NOT CONFUSE REFERENCE TO THE FORM OF A SPECIES WITH THE SIZE OR SHAPE OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIMENS. A SPRUCE SEEDLING DOES NOT FIT THE DEFINITION OF A TREE BUT ALL SPRUCES ARE TREES.
A TREE IS A PLANT FORM THAT CAN BE FOUND IN MANY DIFFERENT ORDERS AND FAMILIES OF PLANTS. TREES SHOW MANY GROWTH FORMS LEAF TYPE AND SHAPE BARK TRAITS AND ORGANS.
THE TREE FORM HAS CHANGED SEPARATELY IN CLASSES OF PLANTS THAT ARE NOT RELATED IN RESPONSE TO SIMILAR PROBLEMS FOR THE TREE. WITH ABOUT 100 000 TYPES OF TREES THE NUMBER OF TREE TYPES IN THE WHOLE WORLD MIGHT BE ONE FOURTH OF ALL LIVING PLANT TYPES. MOST TREE SPECIES GROW IN TROPICAL PARTS OF THE WORLD AND MANY OF THESE AREAS HAVE NOT BEEN SURVEYED YET BY BOTANISTS THEY STUDY PLANTS MAKING SPECIES DIFFERENCE AND RANGES NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD.
THE EARLIEST TREES WERE TREE FERNS HORSETAILS AND LYCOPHYTES WHICH GREW IN FORESTS IN THE CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD TREE FERNS STILL SURVIVE BUT THE ONLY SURVIVING HORSETAILS AND LYCOPHYTES ARE NOT OF TREE FORM. LATER IN THE TRIASSIC PERIOD CONIFERS GINKGOS CYCADS AND OTHER GYMNOSPERMS APPEARED AND SUBSEQUENTLY FLOWERING PLANTS IN THE CRETACEOUS PERIOD. MOST SPECIES OF TREES TODAY ARE FLOWERING PLANTS ANGIOSPERMS AND CONIFERS.
A SMALL GROUP OF TREES GROWING TOGETHER IS CALLED A GROVE OR COPSE AND A LANDSCAPE COVERED BY A DENSE GROWTH OF TREES IS CALLED A FOREST. SEVERAL BIOTOPES ARE DEFINED LARGELY BY THE TREES THAT INHABIT THEM EXAMPLES ARE RAINFOREST AND TAIGA SEE ECOZONES. A LANDSCAPE OF TREES SCATTERED OR SPACED ACROSS GRASSLAND USUALLY GRAZED OR BURNED OVER PERIODICALLY IS CALLED A SAVANNA. A FOREST OF GREAT AGE IS CALLED OLD GROWTH FOREST OR ANCIENT WOODLAND IN THE UK. A VERY YOUNG TREE IS CALLED A SAPLING.
THE COAST REDWOOD IN REDWOOD NATIONAL PARK CALIFORNIA IS BELIEVED TO BE THE WORLD S TALLEST TREE.
THE TALLEST TREES IN AUSTRALIA ARE ALL EUCALYPTS OF WHICH THERE ARE MORE THAN 700 SPECIES. THE SO CALLED MOUNTAIN ASH. WITH A SLIM STRAIGHT TRUNK GROWS TO OVER 300 FEET.
THE STOUTEST LIVING SINGLE TRUNK SPECIES IN DIAMETER IS THE AFRICAN BAOBAB GLENCOE BAOBAB MEASURED NEAR THE GROUND LIMPOPO PROVINCE SOUTH AFRICA. THIS TREE SPLIT UP IN NOVEMBER 2009 AND NOW THE STOUTEST BAOBAB COULD BE SUNLAND BAOBAB SOUTH AFRICA WITH DIAMETER 10.64 M AND CIRCUMFERENCE OF 33.4 M.
SOME TREES DEVELOP MULTIPLE TRUNKS WHETHER FROM AN INDIVIDUAL TREE OR MULTIPLE TREES WHICH GROW TOGETHER. THE SACRED FIG IS A NOTABLE EXAMPLE OF THIS FORMING ADDITIONAL TRUNKS BY GROWING ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS DOWN FROM THE BRANCHES WHICH THEN THICKEN UP WHEN THE ROOT REACHES THE GROUND TO FORM NEW TRUNKS A SINGLE SACRED FIG TREE CAN HAVE HUNDREDS OF SUCH TRUNKS.
THE LIFE SPAN OF TREES IS DETERMINED BY GROWTH RINGS. THESE CAN BE SEEN IF THE TREE IS CUT DOWN OR IN CORES TAKEN FROM THE EDGE TO THE CENTER OF THE TREE. CORRECT DETERMINATION IS ONLY POSSIBLE FOR TREES WHICH MAKE GROWTH RINGS GENERALLY THOSE WHICH OCCUR IN SEASONAL CLIMATES. TREES IN UNIFORM NON SEASONAL TROPICAL CLIMATES ARE ALWAYS GROWING AND DO NOT HAVE DISTINCT GROWTH RINGS. IT IS ALSO ONLY POSSIBLE FOR TREES WHICH ARE SOLID TO THE CENTER OF THE TREE MANY VERY OLD TREES BECOME HOLLOW AS THE DEAD HEARTWOOD DECAYS AWAY. FOR SOME OF THESE SPECIES AGE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE BASIS OF EXTRAPOLATING CURRENT GROWTH RATES BUT THE RESULTS ARE USUALLY LITTLE BETTER THAN GUESSES OR SPECULATION. WHITE PROPOSED A METHOD OF ESTIMATING THE AGE OF LARGE AND VETERAN TREES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM BY CORRELATION BETWEEN A TREE S STEM DIAMETER GROWTH CHARACTER AND AGE.
THE VERIFIED OLDEST MEASURED AGES ARE 
OTHER SPECIES SUSPECTED OF REACHING EXCEPTIONAL AGE INCLUDE EUROPEAN YEW TAXUS BACCATA PROBABLY OVER 2 000 YEARS AND WESTERN REDCEDAR THUJA PLICATA. THE OLDEST KNOWN EUROPEAN YEW IS THE LLANGERNYW YEW IN THE CHURCHYARD OF LLANGERNYW VILLAGE IN NORTH WALES WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO BE BETWEEN 4 000 AND 5 000 YEARS OLD.
THE OLDEST REPORTED AGE FOR AN ANGIOSPERM TREE IS 2293 YEARS FOR THE SRI MAHA BODHI SACRED FIG FICUS RELIGIOSA PLANTED IN 288 BC AT ANURADHAPURA SRI LANKA THIS IS SAID TO BE THE OLDEST HUMAN PLANTED TREE WITH A KNOWN PLANTING DATE.
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT TREES CONTRIBUTE AS MUCH AS 27 OF THE APPRAISED LAND VALUE IN CERTAIN MARKETS.
THESE MOST LIKELY USE DIAMETER MEASURED AT BREAST HEIGHT DBH 4.5 FEET 140 CM ABOVE GROUND NOT THE LARGER BASE DIAMETER. A GENERAL MODEL FOR ANY YEAR AND DIAMETER IS 
ASSUMING 2.2 INFLATION PER YEAR.
TREE CLIMBING IS AN ACTIVITY WHERE ONE MOVES AROUND IN THE CROWN OF TREES.
USE OF A ROPE HELMET AND HARNESS ARE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE CLIMBER. OTHER EQUIPMENT CAN ALSO BE USED DEPENDING ON THE EXPERIENCE AND SKILL OF THE TREE CLIMBER. SOME TREE CLIMBERS TAKE SPECIAL HAMMOCKS CALLED TREEBOATS AND PORTALEDGES WITH THEM INTO THE TREE CANOPIES WHERE THEY CAN ENJOY A PICNIC OR NAP OR SPEND THE NIGHT.
TREE CLIMBING IS AN ON ROPE ACTIVITY THAT PUTS TOGETHER MANY DIFFERENT TRICKS AND GEAR ORIGINALLY DERIVED FROM ROCK CLIMBING AND CAVING. THESE TECHNIQUES ARE USED TO CLIMB TREES FOR MANY PURPOSES INCLUDING TREE CARE ARBORISTS ANIMAL RESCUE RECREATION SPORT RESEARCH AND ACTIVISM.
THE THREE BIG SOURCES OF TREE DAMAGE ARE BIOTIC FROM LIVING SOURCES ABIOTIC FROM NON LIVING SOURCES AND DEFORESTATION CUTTING TREES DOWN. BIOTIC SOURCES WOULD INCLUDE INSECTS WHICH MIGHT BORE INTO THE TREE DEER WHICH MIGHT RUB BARK OFF THE TRUNK OR FUNGI WHICH MIGHT ATTACH THEMSELVES TO THE TREE.
ABIOTIC SOURCES INCLUDE LIGHTNING VEHICLES IMPACTS AND CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES. CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES CAN INVOLVE A NUMBER OF DAMAGE SOURCES INCLUDING GRADE CHANGES THAT PREVENT AERATION TO ROOTS SPILLS INVOLVING TOXIC CHEMICALS SUCH AS CEMENT OR PETROLEUM PRODUCTS OR SEVERING OF BRANCHES OR ROOTS. PEOPLE CAN DAMAGE TREES ALSO.
BOTH DAMAGE SOURCES CAN RESULT IN TREES BECOMING DANGEROUS AND THE TERM HAZARD TREES IS COMMONLY USED BY ARBORISTS AND INDUSTRY GROUPS SUCH AS POWER LINE OPERATORS. HAZARD TREES ARE TREES WHICH DUE TO DISEASE OR OTHER FACTORS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FALLING DURING WINDSTORMS OR HAVING PARTS OF THE TREE FALL.
THE PROCESS OF FINDING THE DANGER A TREE PRESENTS IS BASED ON A PROCESS CALLED THE QUANTIFIED TREE RISK ASSESSMENT.
TREES ARE SIMILAR TO PEOPLE. BOTH CAN TAKE A LOT OF SOME TYPES OF DAMAGE AND SURVIVE BUT EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF TRAUMA CAN RESULT IN DEATH. ARBORISTS ARE VERY AWARE THAT ESTABLISHED TREES WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY APPRECIABLE DISTURBANCE OF THE ROOT SYSTEM. EVEN THOUGH THAT IS TRUE MOST PEOPLE AND CONSTRUCTION PROFESSIONALS DO NOT REALIZE HOW EASILY A TREE CAN BE KILLED.
ONE REASON FOR CONFUSION ABOUT TREE DAMAGE FROM CONSTRUCTION INVOLVES THE DORMANCY OF TREES DURING WINTER. ANOTHER FACTOR IS THAT TREES MAY NOT SHOW SYMPTOMS OF DAMAGE UNTIL 24 MONTHS OR LONGER AFTER DAMAGE HAS OCCURRED. FOR THAT REASON PERSONS WHO DO NOT KNOW ABOUT CARING FOR TREES MAY NOT LINK THE ACTUAL CAUSE WITH THE LATER DAMAGED EFFECT.
VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE LONG RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES THAT IMPACT TREE HEALTH. THE IMPACTS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY CAN RESULT IN MONETARY LOSSES DUE TO TREE DAMAGE AND RESULTANT REMEDIATION OR REPLACEMENT COSTS AS WELL AS VIOLATION OF GOVERNMENT ORDINANCES OR COMMUNITY OR SUBDIVISION RESTRICTIONS.
AS A RESULT PROTOCOLS STANDARD WAYS FOR TREE MANAGEMENT PRIOR TO DURING AND AFTER CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE WELL ESTABLISHED TESTED AND REFINED CHANGED. THESE BASIC STEPS ARE INVOLVED 
THE TREE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CULTURAL SYMBOL. COMMON ICONS ARE THE WORLD TREE FOR INSTANCE YGGDRASIL AND THE TREE OF LIFE. THE TREE IS OFTEN USED TO REPRESENT NATURE OR THE ENVIRONMENT ITSELF. A COMMON MISTAKE WRONG THING IS THAT TREES GET MOST OF THEIR MASS FROM THE GROUND. IN FACT 99 OF A TREE S MASS COMES FROM THE AIR.
A WISH TREE OR WISHING TREE IS A SINGLE TREE USUALLY DISTINGUISHED BY SPECIES POSITION OR APPEARANCE WHICH IS USED AS AN OBJECT OF WISHES AND OFFERINGS. SUCH TREES ARE IDENTIFIED AS POSSESSING A SPECIAL RELIGIOUS OR SPIRITUAL VALUE. BY TRADITION BELIEVERS MAKE VOTIVE OFFERINGS IN ORDER TO GAIN FROM THAT NATURE SPIRIT SAINT OR GODDESS FULFILLMENT OF A WISH.
TREE WORSHIP REFERS TO THE TENDENCY OF MANY SOCIETIES IN ALL OF HISTORY TO WORSHIP OR OTHERWISE MYTHOLOGIZE TREES. TREES HAVE PLAYED A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN MANY OF THE WORLD S MYTHOLOGIES AND RELIGIONS AND HAVE BEEN GIVEN DEEP AND SACRED MEANINGS THROUGHOUT THE AGES. HUMAN BEINGS SEEING THE GROWTH AND DEATH OF TREES THE ELASTICITY OF THEIR BRANCHES THE SENSITIVENESS AND THE ANNUAL EVERY YEAR DECAY AND REVIVAL OF THEIR FOLIAGE SEE THEM AS POWERFUL SYMBOLS OF GROWTH DECAY AND RESURRECTION. THE MOST ANCIENT CROSS CULTURAL SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION OF THE UNIVERSE S CONSTRUCTION IS THE WORLD TREE.
THE TREE WITH ITS BRANCHES REACHING UP INTO THE SKY AND ROOTS DEEP INTO THE EARTH CAN BE SEEN TO DWELL IN THREE WORLDS A LINK BETWEEN HEAVEN THE EARTH AND THE UNDERWORLD UNITING ABOVE AND BELOW. IT IS ALSO BOTH A FEMININE SYMBOL BEARING SUSTENANCE AND A MASCULINE PHALLIC SYMBOL ANOTHER UNION.
FOR THIS REASON MANY MYTHOLOGIES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE THE CONCEPT OF THE WORLD TREE A GREAT TREE THAT ACTS AS AN AXIS MUNDI HOLDING UP THE COSMOS AND PROVIDING A LINK BETWEEN THE HEAVENS EARTH AND UNDERWORLD. IN EUROPEAN MYTHOLOGY THE BEST KNOWN EXAMPLE IS THE TREE YGGDRASIL FROM NORSE MYTHOLOGY.
THE WORLD TREE IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT PART OF MESOAMERICAN MYTHOLOGIES WHERE IT REPRESENTS THE FOUR CARDINAL DIRECTIONS NORTH SOUTH EAST AND WEST. THE CONCEPT OF THE WORLD TREE IS ALSO CLOSELY LINKED TO THE MOTIF OF THE TREE OF LIFE.
IN LITERATURE A MYTHOLOGY WAS NOTABLY DEVELOPED BY J.R.R. TOLKIEN HIS TWO TREES OF VALINOR PLAYING A CENTRAL ROLE IN HIS 1964 TREE AND LEAF. WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS DESCRIBES A HOLY TREE IN HIS POEM THE TWO TREES 1893.
THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF TREES. HERE IS A LIST OF SOME OF THEM 
UNIT OF MEASUREMENT
MEASUREMENT IS A PROCESS THAT USES NUMBERS TO DESCRIBE A PHYSICAL QUANTITY BASED ON WHAT WE CAN OBSERVE. THIS IS DONE TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE THEM TO EACH OTHER. WE CAN MEASURE HOW BIG THINGS ARE HOW WARM THEY ARE HOW HEAVY THEY ARE AND LOTS OF OTHER FEATURES AS WELL. UNITS OF MEASUREMENT PROVIDE STANDARDS FOR OUR COMPARISONS SO THAT THE NUMBERS FROM OUR MEASUREMENTS REFER TO THE SAME THING. 
FOR EXAMPLE THE METRE IS A STANDARD UNIT TO MEASURE LENGTH. BEFORE 1982 IT WAS DEFINED AS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO MARKERS ON A SPECIAL ROD. NOW SCIENTISTS DEFINE THE METRE BY USING THE SPEED OF LIGHT. SAYING SOMETHING HAS A LENGTH OF 2 METRES MEANS THAT IT IS EXACTLY TWICE AS LONG AS THAT ROD USED TO DEFINE THE METRE OR THAT LIGHT TAKES TWICE THE TIME DEFINED FOR A METRE TO TRAVEL THAT DISTANCE.
IN PAST CENTURIES MANY DIFFERENT UNITS WERE USED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. TODAY MOST UNITS OF MEASURE FALL INTO ONE OF THREE SYSTEMS 
THE OLDER TWO THE BRITISH IMPERIAL SYSTEM AND THE CLOSELY RELATED US CUSTOMARY SYSTEM USE THE FOOT AS A MEASURE OF LENGTH THE POUND AS A MEASURE FOR WEIGHT AND THE SECOND AS A MEASURE FOR TIME. THEY USE OTHER UNITS AS WELL. THE NUMBER OF SMALLER UNITS THAT MAKE THE BIGGER UNITS IN THESE TWO SYSTEMS VARIES FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE 12 INCHES IN A FOOT AND 16 OUNCES IN A POUND. 
THE NEWEST OF THE THREE SYSTEMS IS THE METRIC SYSTEM OR SI SYSTEM WHICH USUALLY USE 10 100 OR 1000 OF A SMALLER UNIT TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE FOR INSTANCE THERE ARE 100 CENTIMETRES IN 1 METRE OR 1000 GRAMS IN 1 KILOGRAM. THIS SYSTEM USES THE METRE FOR LENGTH THE KILOGRAM FOR WEIGHT AND LIKE THE OTHER TWO SYSTEMS THE SECOND FOR TIME.
THE PROPERTY OF THE THING BEING MEASURED IS GIVEN AS A NUMBER OF UNITS OF MEASURE. THE NUMBER ONLY HAS SENSE WHEN THE UNIT OF MEASUREMENT IS ALSO GIVEN.
FOR EXAMPLE THE EIFFEL TOWER IN PARIS FRANCE IS 300 METERS TALL. THAT IS THE DISTANCE FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM OF THE EIFFEL TOWER IS 300 METERS. THE PROPERTY OF THE EIFFEL TOWER BEING MEASURED IS A DISTANCE. THE NUMBER MEASURED IS 300. THIS NUMBER DOES NOT MAKE SENSE WITHOUT THE UNIT OF MEASURE. THE UNIT OF MEASURE IS THE METER
STANDARDS ARE SPECIAL OBJECTS THAT ARE USED TO MAKE MEASUREMENTS IN TERMS OF FIXED UNITS OF MEASUREMENT. A METRE STICK IS AN EXAMPLE OF A STANDARD. WHEN YOU MEASURE SOMETHING WITH A METRE STICK YOU CAN COMPARE THAT MEASUREMENT TO ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS ALSO MEASURED WITH A METRE STICK. THIS MAKES MEASUREMENT EASIER AND COMPARISONS BETWEEN MEASUREMENTS EASIER.
THERE ARE UNITS OF MEASUREMENT OF DIFFERENT SIZES. THERE ARE SMALL UNITS OF MEASUREMENT TO MEASURE SMALL THINGS. THERE ARE BIG UNITS OF MEASUREMENT TO MEASURE BIG THINGS.
SCIENCE MEDICINE AND ENGINEERING USE SMALLER UNITS OF MEASUREMENT TO MEASURE SMALL THINGS WITH LESS ERROR. IT IS EASY TO MEASURE LARGE THINGS USING LARGER UNITS OF MEASUREMENT. LARGE MEASUREMENTS LIKE THE WIDTH OF A GALAXY AND SMALL MEASUREMENTS LIKE THE MASS OF AN ATOM USE SPECIAL UNITS OF MEASUREMENT.
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND UNITS USED ALL OVER THE WORLD. MOST BECAME LESS USED DURING THE 19TH AND 20TH CENTURIES.
THE METRIC SYSTEM IS A SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENT USED IN MOST OF THE WORLD. IT IS ALSO CALLED THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS OR SI.
UNITS OF MEASURE IN THE METRIC SYSTEM INCLUDE 
IMPERIAL UNITS WERE DEFINED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN 1825. THESE UNITS SOMETIMES BASED ON SIMILAR UNITS THAT WERE IN USE BEFORE 1825. IMPERIAL UNITS WERE USED IN COUNTRIES THAT WERE PART OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE. WHILE MANY OF THESE COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM HAVE OFFICIALLY ADOPTED SI THE OLDER SYSTEM OF UNITS ARE STILL USED.
US CUSTOMARY UNITS ARE THE OFFICIAL UNITS USED IN THE US. THESE ARE SIMILAR TO THE BRITISH IMPERIAL UNITS AND ALSO BASED ON THE UNITS USED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM FROM BEFORE AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE. SOME OF THE UNITS ARE DIFFERENT TO THE BRITISH ONES. FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE 20 IMPERIAL FLUID OUNCES IN AN IMPERIAL PINT BUT 16 US FLUID OUNCES IN A US PINT. ADDITIONALLY THE US FLUID OUNCE IS SLIGHTLY BIGGER THAN THE IMPERIAL FLUID OUNCE. THE RESULT IS THAT US PINTS AND GALLONS ARE SMALLER THAN IMPERIAL PINTS AND GALLONS. IN THE UNITED STATES THE METRIC SYSTEM HAS BEEN LEGAL FOR TRADE SINCE 1866 BUT OTHER MEASUREMENTS SUCH AS THE GALLON INCH AND THE POUND ARE STILL WIDELY USED.
IMPERIAL AND US UNITS OF MEASUREMENT INCLUDE 
THE OUNCES FOR WEIGHT AND VOLUME ARE DIFFERENT. EVEN WHEN MEASURING WATER THE NUMBER OF OUNCES OF WEIGHT IS NOT THE SAME AS THE NUMBER OF FLUID OUNCES.
THE UNIT OF TIME IS THE SECOND. THE MINUTE 60 SECONDS AND HOUR 60 MINUTES OR 3600 SECONDS ARE LARGER UNITS. A DAY IS USUALLY SAID TO BE 24 HOURS BUT IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN THAT. THIS DIFFERENCE IS CORRECTED AT THE END OF SOME YEARS WITH WHAT IS CALLED A LEAP SECOND. A WEEK 7 DAYS AND MONTH ARE ALSO STANDARD UNITS.
A UNIT OF MEASUREMENT THAT APPLIES TO MONEY IS CALLED A UNIT OF ACCOUNT. THIS IS NORMALLY A CURRENCY ISSUED BY A COUNTRY. FOR INSTANCE THE UNITED STATES USE DOLLARS. EACH DOLLAR IS 100 CENTS. THE UNITED KINGDOM USES POUNDS. EACH POUND IS 100 PENNIES OR PENCE. OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE USE THE EURO WHICH IS 100 CENT FOR THE EURO THEY ARE NOT CALLED CENTS.
UNITED KINGDOM
THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND SIMPLY CALLED THE UNITED KINGDOM OR UK IS A SOVEREIGN STATE IN NORTHERN EUROPE. IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY THAT IS MADE UP OF FOUR SEPARATE COUNTRIES. IT IS A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION UNITED NATIONS THE COMMONWEALTH NATO AND THE G8. IT HAS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. 
AROUND 65 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN THE UK. THEY CAN BE DIVIDED INTO FOUR BIG NATIONALITIES BASED ON THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY LIVE. THESE COUNTRIES AND THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE AND LANGUAGE SPOKEN THERE ARE AS FOLLOWS 
BETWEEN THE 17TH AND MID 20TH CENTURIES BRITAIN WAS A WORLD POWER. IT BECAME A COLONIAL EMPIRE THAT CONTROLLED LARGE AREAS OF AFRICA ASIA NORTH AMERICA AND OCEANIA. MANY COUNTRIES LEFT AND BECAME INDEPENDENT FROM THE EMPIRE IN THE 20TH CENTURY ALTHOUGH BRITAIN KEEPS LINKS WITH MOST COUNTRIES OF ITS FORMER EMPIRE.
THE UK HAS MANY CITIES. ENGLAND IS HOME TO LONDON THE BIGGEST CITY IN THE UK AND ALSO ITS CAPITAL CITY. THERE ARE ALSO MANY OTHER BIG CITIES IN ENGLAND INCLUDING BIRMINGHAM MANCHESTER LIVERPOOL LEEDS BRISTOL AND NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE. SCOTLAND HAS THE BIG CITIES OF EDINBURGH AND GLASGOW. CARDIFF AND SWANSEA ARE IN WALES AND BELFAST IS IN NORTHERN IRELAND. THE UK HAD A DOMINATING EMPIRE NAMED THE BRITISH EMPIRE. AT ITS HEIGHT IN 1922 MORE THAN 458 MILLION PEOPLE LIVED IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE ONE FIFTH OF THE EARTH S POPULATION. ITS AREA WAS 13 012 000 SQ MI ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE EARTH S LAND AREA. THE BRITISH EMPIRE WAS OFTEN CALLED THE EMPIRE ON WHICH THE SUN NEVER SETS THAT DESCRIBES A LARGE EMPIRE BECAUSE THE SUN IS ALWAYS SHINING ON AT LEAST ONE OF ITS TERRITORIES.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL REMAINS SHOW THAT THE FIRST GROUP OF PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THE BRITISH ISLES WERE HUNTER GATHERERS AFTER THE LAST ICE AGE ENDED. THE DATE IS NOT KNOWN PERHAPS AS EARLY AS 8000 BUT CERTAINLY BY 5000. THEY BUILT MESOLITHIC WOOD AND STONE MONUMENTS. STONEHENGE WAS BUILT BETWEEN 3000 AND 1600. CELTIC TRIBES ARRIVED FROM MAINLAND EUROPE. BRITAIN WAS A CHANGING COLLECTION OF TRIBAL AREAS WITH NO OVERALL LEADER. JULIUS CAESAR TRIED TO INVADE TAKE OVER THE ISLAND IN 55 BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO DO SO. THE ROMANS SUCCESSFULLY INVADED IN 43.
WRITTEN HISTORY BEGAN IN BRITAIN WHEN WRITING WAS BROUGHT TO BRITAIN BY THE ROMANS. ROME RULED IN BRITAIN FROM 44AD TO 410AD BUT THEY ONLY RULED ENGLAND AND WALES. THE ROMANS NEVER RULED SCOTLAND NORTH OF THE CLYDE FORTH VALLEY OR IRELAND THEIR NORTHERN BOUNDARY VARIED FROM TIME TO TIME AND WAS MARKED FOR A WHILE AT HADRIAN S WALL.
AFTER THE ROMANS TWO WAVES OF IMMIGRANTS CAME TO BRITAIN. THE FIRST WERE GERMAN TRIBES THE ANGLES SAXONS AND JUTES. ENGLISH THE LANGUAGE IS A DEVELOPMENT FROM ANGLO SAXON OLD ENGLISH AND IS A GERMANIC LANGUAGE. THE SECOND WERE THE VIKINGS.
AFTER A LONG PERIOD WHEN ENGLAND WAS SPLIT INTO VARIOUS KINGDOMS IT WAS MADE INTO ONE COUNTRY BY THELSTAN ATHELSTAN IN 945. ENGLAND AND WALES WERE UNIFIED BY EDWARD I LONGSHANKS BY FORCE IN THE 13TH CENTURY.
UNION WITH SCOTLAND TOOK MUCH LONGER THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF CONFLICTS BETWEEN BOTH PARTS OF BRITAIN. THIS UNION BETWEEN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND IN 1707 FORMED THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN WHICH MERGED SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND INTO ONE COUNTRY.
IN 1603 WHEN QUEEN ELIZABETH I OF ENGLAND DIED HER CLOSEST RELATIVE WAS KING JAMES VI OF SCOTLAND. HE BECAME KING OF ENGLAND AS WELL AS KING OF SCOTLAND. IN 1707 THE SCOTTISH AND ENGLISH PARLIAMENTS AGREED THE TREATY OF UNION WHICH JOINED THE TWO COUNTRIES INTO ONE COUNTRY CALLED THE KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN UNDER QUEEN ANNE.
BY 1800 BOTH SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND HAD ALREADY INDEPENDENTLY HAD MUCH INFLUENCE OVER IRELAND SINCE 1200. IN THAT YEAR LAWS WERE PASSED IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND TO MERGE THE TWO STATES. THE NEW COUNTRY WAS CALLED THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. IN 1922 MUCH OF IRELAND BECAME INDEPENDENT AS THE IRISH FREE STATE NOW CALLED IRELAND FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM. HOWEVER SIX NORTHERN COUNTIES CALLED NORTHERN IRELAND CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE COUNTRY WAS RENAMED THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND.
THE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE REPRESENTED BY MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT NOT RULED BY MONARCHS. HOWEVER AFTER THE ENGLISH CIVIL WAR OLIVER CROMWELL BECAME LORD PROTECTOR AND THE MONARCHY WAS DISBANDED THOUGH THE MONARCHY WAS RESTORED AFTER HIS DEATH THE CROWN SLOWLY BECAME THE SECONDARY POWER AND PARLIAMENT THE FIRST. MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT CALLED MPS WERE ELECTED BUT UNTIL THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY ONLY MEN WHO OWNED PROPERTY COULD VOTE. IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY MORE PEOPLE WERE GIVEN SUFFRAGE THE RIGHT TO VOTE BUT EVEN SO BY 1900 WOMEN COULD NOT VOTE AND ONLY 40 OF MEN WERE RICH ENOUGH TO VOTE. BUT IN 1928 ALL ADULTS MALE AND FEMALE GOT THE VOTE THIS IS CALLED UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE.
PARLIAMENT IS IN LONDON BUT IT HAS POWER OVER THE WHOLE OF THE UK. TODAY WALES SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND EACH HAVE THEIR OWN SEATS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT THEY HAVE MORE LIMITED POWERS SCOTLAND HAS THE SELF NAMED SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT. THE WELSH HAVE AN ASSEMBLY AND THE NORTHERN IRISH HAVE STORMOUNT. THERE ISN T AN INDIVIDUAL ENGLISH PARLIAMENT REPRESENTING THE VIEWS OF ONLY ENGLISH REGIONS. THERE ARE ALSO PARLIAMENTS IN THE ISLE OF MAN AND THE CHANNEL ISLANDS WHICH ARE ISLANDS THAT ARE PARTLY CONTROLLED BY THE UK AND PARTLY INDEPENDENT.
THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT BELONG TO POLITICAL PARTIES THE BIGGEST PARTIES ARE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY LABOUR PARTY THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY AND THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS. MEMBERS OF THE SAME PARTY AGREE TO ACT AND VOTE MORE OR LESS TOGETHER. A PARTY WITH MORE THAN HALF THE SEATS A MAJORITY FORMS THE GOVERNMENT THE LEADER OF THE PARTY BECOMES THE PRIME MINISTER WHO THEN APPOINTS OTHER MINISTERS. BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS A MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT IT CAN NORMALLY CONTROL WHAT LAWS ARE PASSED.
MAJOR LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN THE UNITED KINGDOM OTHER THAN ENGLISH INCLUDE POLISH 500 000 APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF SPEAKERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM EASTERN PANJABI OR PUNJABI 471 000 BENGALI 400 000 URDU 400 000 CANTONESE 300 000 GREEK 200 000 SOUTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN CREOLE ENGLISH 170 000.
THE UK IS MADE UP OF FOUR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WALES ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND. THE CAPITAL CITY OF WALES IS CARDIFF. THE CAPITAL CITY OF ENGLAND IS LONDON. THE CAPITAL CITY OF SCOTLAND IS EDINBURGH AND THE CAPITAL CITY OF NORTHERN IRELAND IS BELFAST. OTHER LARGE CITIES IN THE UK ARE BIRMINGHAM BRISTOL MANCHESTER LIVERPOOL NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE LEEDS SHEFFIELD GLASGOW SOUTHAMPTON LEICESTER COVENTRY BRADFORD AND NOTTINGHAM.
THE UK IS NORTH WEST OFF THE COAST OF MAINLAND EUROPE. AROUND THE UK ARE THE NORTH SEA THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AND THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. THE UK ALSO RULES USUALLY INDIRECTLY A NUMBER OF SMALLER PLACES MOSTLY ISLANDS ROUND THE WORLD WHICH ARE KNOWN AS OVERSEAS TERRITORIES. THEY ARE REMNANTS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE.
THE WEATHER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM IS CHANGEABLE AND UNPREDICTABLE. SUMMERS ARE MODERATELY WARM WINTERS ARE COOL TO COLD. RAIN FALLS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND MORE ON THE WEST THAN THE EAST BECAUSE OF ITS NORTHERLY LATITUDE AND THE WARM WATER FROM THE ATLANTIC OCEAN S GULF STREAM. THE USUALLY MODERATE PREVAILING WINDS FROM THE ATLANTIC MAY BE INTERRUPTED BY ARCTIC AIR FROM THE NORTH EAST OR HOT AIR FROM THE SAHARA.
THE UK IS A PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY BASED ON A CONSTITUTIONAL AND HEREDITARY MONARCHY. THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM VOTE FOR A MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT TO SPEAK FOR THEM AND TO MAKE LAWS FOR THEM. QUEEN ELIZABETH II IS THE QUEEN OF THE UK AND IS THE HEAD OF STATE. EVEN THOUGH SHE IS THE HEAD OF STATE SHE DOES NOT ACTUALLY GOVERN THE COUNTRY. THE GOVERNMENT LED BY THE PRIME MINISTER GOVERNS THE COUNTRY AND DECIDES POLICY. TODAY THE PRIME MINISTER IS THERESA MAY WHO IS THE LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND WAS NOT DIRECTLY ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY.
PARLIAMENT IS WHERE LAWS ARE MADE. IT HAS THREE PARTS THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND THE QUEEN. THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS THE MOST POWERFUL PART. IT IS WHERE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT SIT. THE PRIME MINISTER SITS HERE AS WELL BECAUSE THEY ARE A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT. THE PEOPLE WHO SIT IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS ARE CALLED PEERS THEY ARE NOT CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE. MOST PEERS ARE NOW APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE HEREDITARY PEERS THEIR FATHERS WERE PEERS AND A FEW OTHERS SUCH AS CERTAIN BISHOPS IN THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND THE JUDICIARY LAW LORDS.
SCOTLAND HAS ITS OWN DEVOLVED PARLIAMENT WITH POWER TO MAKE LAWS ON THINGS LIKE EDUCATION HEALTH AND SCOTTISH LAW. NORTHERN IRELAND AND WALES HAVE THEIR OWN DEVOLVED ASSEMBLIES WHICH HAVE SOME POWERS BUT LESS THAN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT. THE UK PARLIAMENT REMAINS SOVEREIGN AND IT COULD END THE DEVOLVED ADMINISTRATIONS AT ANY TIME.
THE UK HAS A MILITARY OF AROUND 223 000 PEOPLE NOT INCLUDING RESERVE FORCES. THE UK HAS ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED MILITARY IN THE WORLD ALONGSIDE SUCH COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE USA AND FRANCE AND OPERATES A LARGE ARMY BRITISH ARMY A SIZABLE NAVY ROYAL NAVY AND AIR FORCE ROYAL AIR FORCE. FROM THE 18TH CENTURY TO THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY THE UK WAS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL NATIONS IN THE WORLD WITH A HUGE NAVY DUE TO THE FACT IT WAS SURROUNDED BY SEA SO A LARGE NAVY WAS THE MOST PRACTICAL OPTION. THIS STATUS HAS FADED IN RECENT TIMES BUT THE UK REMAINS A MEMBER OF VARIOUS MILITARY GROUPS SUCH AS THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL AND NATO. IT IS ALSO STILL SEEN AS A GREAT MILITARY POWER.
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
LONDON THE CAPITAL IS FAMOUS AS BEING THE LARGEST CENTRE OF FINANCE IN THE WORLD ALONG WITH NEW YORK CITY IN THE UNITED STATES.
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE WAS AN ENGLISH PLAYWRIGHT. HE WROTE PLAYS IN THE LATE 16TH CENTURY. SOME OF HIS PLAYS WERE ROMEO AND JULIET AND MACBETH. IN THE 19TH CENTURY JANE AUSTEN AND CHARLES DICKENS WERE NOVELISTS. TWENTIETH CENTURY WRITERS INCLUDE THE SCIENCE FICTION NOVELIST H.G. WELLS AND J.R.R. TOLKIEN. THE CHILDREN S FANTASY HARRY POTTER SERIES WAS WRITTEN BY J.K. ROWLING. ALDOUS HUXLEY WAS ALSO FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM.
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LITERATURE IS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS FROM MANY COUNTRIES. EIGHT PEOPLE FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM HAVE WON THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE. SEAMUS HEANEY IS A WRITER WHO WAS BORN IN NORTHERN IRELAND.
ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE FROM SCOTLAND WROTE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES DETECTIVE NOVELS. HE WAS FROM EDINBURGH. THE POET DYLAN THOMAS BROUGHT WELSH CULTURE TO INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION.
ENGLAND NORTHERN IRELAND SCOTLAND AND WALES HAVE SEPARATE BUT SIMILAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. THEY ALL HAVE RULES THAT EDUCATION IS REQUIRED FROM AGES FIVE TO EIGHTEEN EXCEPT FOR IN SCOTLAND WHERE SCHOOL DEPARTURE IS ALLOWED FROM THE AGE OF SIXTEEN. MANY CHILDREN ATTEND STATE SCHOOLS AND OTHER CHILDREN ATTEND PRIVATE SCHOOLS.
BRITAIN S UNIVERSITIES ARE THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE AND UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD AND LONDON UNIVERSITIES UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS KING S COLLEGE LONDON AND IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON WHICH COLLECTIVELY FORM THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE OF UK UNIVERSITIES.
A BROADER GROUP OF TWENTY UNIVERSITIES FORM THE RUSSELL GROUP WHICH ACCOUNT FOR TWO THIRDS OF RESEARCH GRANTS AND CONTRACT FUNDING OUT OF THE TOTAL OF 100 UNIVERSITIES.
ROAD TRAFFIC IN THE UNITED KINGDOM DRIVES ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE ROAD UNLIKE THE AMERICAS AND SOME OF THE REST OF EUROPE AND THE DRIVER STEERS FROM THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. THE ROAD NETWORK ON THE ISLAND OF GREAT BRITAIN IS EXTENSIVE WITH MOST LOCAL AND RURAL ROADS HAVING EVOLVED FROM ROMAN AND MEDIEVAL TIMES. MAJOR ROUTES DEVELOPED IN THE MID 20TH CENTURY WERE MADE TO THE NEEDS OF THE MOTOR CAR. THE HIGH SPEED MOTORWAY FREEWAY NETWORK WAS MOSTLY CONSTRUCTED IN THE 1960S AND 1970S AND LINKS TOGETHER MAJOR TOWNS AND CITIES.
THE SYSTEM OF RAIL TRANSPORT WAS INVENTED IN ENGLAND AND WALES SO THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS THE OLDEST RAILWAY NETWORK IN THE WORLD. IT WAS BUILT MOSTLY DURING THE VICTORIAN ERA. AT THE HEART OF THE NETWORK ARE FIVE LONG DISTANCE MAIN LINES WHICH RADIATE FROM LONDON TO THE MAJOR CITIES AND SECONDARY POPULATION CENTRES WITH DENSE COMMUTER NETWORKS WITHIN THE REGIONS. THE NEWEST PART OF THE NETWORK CONNECTS LONDON TO THE CHANNEL TUNNEL FROM ST PANCRAS STATION AND IS BUILT TO THE SAME STANDARD AS THE FRENCH TGV SYSTEM. THE BRITISH RAIL NETWORK IS PART PRIVATISED WITH PRIVATELY OWNED TRAIN OPERATING COMPANIES PROVIDING SERVICE ALONG PARTICULAR LINES OR REGIONS WHILST THE TRACKS SIGNALS AND STATIONS ARE OWNED BY A GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED COMPANY CALLED NETWORK RAIL. IN NORTHERN IRELAND THE NI RAILWAYS IS THE NATIONAL RAILWAY. THE SYSTEM OF UNDERGROUND RAILWAYS IN LONDON KNOWN AS THE TUBE HAS BEEN COPIED BY MANY OTHER CITIES.
MOST DOMESTIC AIR TRAVEL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IS BETWEEN LONDON AND THE MAJOR CITIES IN SCOTLAND AND THE NORTH OF ENGLAND. LONDON HEATHROW IS THE NATION S LARGEST AIRPORT AND IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL HUBS IN THE WORLD. OTHER MAJOR AIRPORTS WITH PRINCIPAL INTERNATIONAL SERVICE INCLUDE LONDON GATWICK BIRMINGHAM MANCHESTER AND GLASGOW.
AN EXTENSIVE SYSTEM OF FERRY NETWORKS OPERATE BETWEEN THE SCOTTISH ISLANDS AND MAJOR FERRY ROUTES OPERATE BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FRANCE VIA THE ENGLISH CHANNEL SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND VIA THE IRISH SEA AND ENGLAND WALES REPUBLIC OF IRELAND FROM LIVERPOOL HOLYHEAD.
UNITED NATIONS
THE UNITED NATIONS UN IS AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION ESTABLISHED ON 24 OCTOBER 1945 TO PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. IT WAS FOUNDED TO REPLACE THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS FOLLOWING WORLD WAR II AND TO PREVENT ANOTHER CONFLICT. WHEN IT WAS FOUNDED THE UN HAD 51 MEMBER STATES THERE ARE NOW 193. MOST NATIONS ARE MEMBERS OF THE UN AND SEND DIPLOMATS TO THE HEADQUARTERS TO HOLD MEETINGS AND MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT GLOBAL ISSUES. 
THE GOALS OF THE UNITED NATIONS ARE 
AFTER WORLD WAR I THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD FORMED THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. THIS ORGANIZATION WAS A PLACE WHERE NATIONS COULD TALK THROUGH THEIR DIFFERENCES CALMLY. HOWEVER SOME COUNTRIES LIKE GERMANY ITALY AND JAPAN IGNORED THE LEAGUE AND TRIED TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS THROUGH WAR. MEMBERS OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS DID NOT WANT TO GO TO WAR TO PROTECT OTHER MEMBERS AND THE LEAGUE FAILED. A SECOND WORLD WAR SOON FOLLOWED.
DURING WORLD WAR II THE ALLIED POWERS OFTEN CALLED THEMSELVES THE UNITED NATIONS UNITED AGAINST THE AXIS POWERS. AFTER THE WAR THE WINNERS FORMED A NEW ORGANIZATION FOR WORLD PEACE. ON 25TH APRIL 1945 IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY DECIDED ON THE NAME UNITED NATIONS. IN JUNE THEY SIGNED THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER SAYING HOW THE ORGANIZATION WOULD WORK. THE UN WAS CREATED ON 24 OCTOBER 1945 AND ITS FIRST MEETING WAS HELD IN JANUARY 1946. SINCE 1947 THE 24TH OF OCTOBER HAS BEEN CALLED UNITED NATIONS DAY.
ALL ORGANS OF THE UNITED NATIONS ARE BASED IN NEW YORK CITY EXCEPT THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE WHICH IS LOCATED AT THE HAGUE IN NETHERLANDS
THE MAIN BUILDING FOR THE UNITED NATIONS IS IN NEW YORK CITY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BUT THE UN ALSO HAS IMPORTANT OFFICES IN GENEVA SWITZERLAND NAIROBI KENYA AND VIENNA AUSTRIA. THE UN TRIES TO BE PEACEFUL BUT SOMETIMES WHEN TALKS DO NOT WORK THE UN UNLIKE THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS WILL FIGHT TOO. IN THE 1950S THE UN HELPED SOUTH KOREA IN A WAR AGAINST NORTH KOREA AND IN THE 1990S THE UN HELPED TO FORCE IRAQI SOLDIERS OUT OF KUWAIT. AT OTHER TIMES THE UN HAS FORMED PEACEKEEPING FORCES. UN PEACEKEEPERS TRAVEL TO TROUBLED PLACES IN THE WORLD AND TRY SOMETIMES SUCCESSFULLY SOMETIMES NOT TO KEEP THE PEACE. TODAY THERE ARE UN PEACEKEEPERS WORKING IN AFGHANISTAN CYPRUS HAITI LIBERIA AND SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES.
THROUGH A SERIES OF GOALS RESOLUTIONS AND DECLARATIONS ADOPTED BY MEMBER NATIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONS THE WORLD HAS A SET OF COMMITMENTS ACTIONS AND GOALS TO STOP AND REVERSE THE SPREAD OF HIV AND SCALE UP TOWARDS UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO HIV PREVENTION TREATMENT CARE AND SUPPORT SERVICES.
THE UNITED NATIONS HAS SET UP SIX PRINCIPAL ORGANS 
ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE SO CALLED SPECIAL AGENCIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS. SOME ARE OLDER THAN THE UNITED NATIONS. HERE ARE A FEW OF THEM 
NOTES
UNITED STATES
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA USA OFTEN CALLED THE UNITED STATES U.S. OR AMERICA IS THE SECOND LARGEST COUNTRY IN NORTH AMERICA. IT IS MADE UP OF 50 STATES A FEDERAL DISTRICT AND FIVE TERRITORIES. IT HAS GREAT INFLUENCE OVER WORLD FINANCE TRADE CULTURE MILITARY POLITICS AND TECHNOLOGY.
THE UNITED STATES IS A FEDERAL REPUBLIC. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS SET UP BY THE CONSTITUTION. THERE ARE THREE BRANCHES. THEY ARE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. STATE GOVERNMENTS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORK IN VERY SIMILAR WAYS. EACH STATE HAS ITS OWN EXECUTIVE LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF A STATE GOVERNMENT IS LED BY A GOVERNOR INSTEAD OF A PRESIDENT.
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT ENFORCES THE LAW. MEMBERS OF THE U.S. ELECTORAL COLLEGE ELECT A PRESIDENT WHO IS THE LEADER OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AS WELL AS THE LEADER OF THE ARMED FORCES. THE PRESIDENT MAY VETO A BILL THAT THE CONGRESS HAS PASSED SO IT DOES NOT BECOME A LAW. THE PRESIDENT MAY ALSO MAKE EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE FOLLOW THE LAW.
THE PRESIDENT IS IN CHARGE OF MANY DEPARTMENTS THAT CONTROL MUCH OF THE DAY TO DAY ACTIONS OF GOVERNMENT. FOR EXAMPLE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE MAKES RULES ABOUT TRADE. THE PRESIDENT CHOOSES THE HEADS OF THESE DEPARTMENTS AND ALSO NOMINATES FEDERAL JUDGES. HOWEVER THE SENATE PART OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH MUST AGREE WITH ALL OF THE PEOPLE THE PRESIDENT CHOOSES. THE PRESIDENT MAY SERVE TWO 4 YEAR TERMS.
THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH MAKES LAWS. THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH IS CALLED THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. CONGRESS IS DIVIDED INTO TWO HOUSES.
ONE HOUSE IS THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THE REPRESENTATIVES ARE EACH ELECTED BY VOTERS FROM A SET AREA WITHIN A STATE. THE NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES A STATE HAS IS BASED ON HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE THERE. REPRESENTATIVES SERVE TWO YEAR TERMS. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES TODAY IS 435. THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.
THE OTHER HOUSE IS THE SENATE. IN THE SENATE EACH STATE IS REPRESENTED EQUALLY BY TWO SENATORS. BECAUSE THERE ARE 50 STATES THERE ARE 100 SENATORS. THE PRESIDENT S TREATIES OR APPOINTMENTS OF OFFICIALS NEED THE SENATE S APPROVAL. SENATORS SERVE SIX YEAR TERMS. THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SERVES AS PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE. IN PRACTICE THE VICE PRESIDENT IS USUALLY ABSENT FROM THE SENATE AND A SENATOR SERVES AS PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OR TEMPORARY PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE.
REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS PROPOSE LAWS CALLED BILLS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HOUSES. A BILL MAY BE VOTED UPON BY THE ENTIRE HOUSE RIGHT AWAY OR MAY FIRST GO TO A SMALL GROUP KNOWN AS A COMMITTEE WHICH MAY RECOMMEND A BILL FOR A VOTE BY THE WHOLE HOUSE. IF ONE HOUSE VOTES TO PASS A BILL THE BILL THEN GETS SENT TO THE OTHER HOUSE IF BOTH HOUSES VOTE FOR IT IT IS THEN SENT TO THE PRESIDENT WHO MAY SIGN THE BILL INTO LAW OR VETO IT. IF THE PRESIDENT VETOES THE BILL IT IS SENT BACK TO CONGRESS. IF CONGRESS VOTES AGAIN AND PASSES THE BILL WITH AT LEAST A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY THE BILL BECOMES LAW AND CANNOT BE VETOED BY THE PRESIDENT.
UNDER THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF FEDERALISM CONGRESS MAY NOT MAKE LAWS THAT DIRECTLY CONTROL THE STATES INSTEAD CONGRESS MAY USE THE PROMISE OF FEDERAL FUNDS OR SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS NATIONAL EMERGENCIES TO ENCOURAGE THE STATES TO FOLLOW FEDERAL LAW. THIS SYSTEM IS BOTH COMPLEX AND UNIQUE.
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS THE PART OF GOVERNMENT THAT INTERPRETS WHAT THE LAW MEANS. THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS MADE UP OF THE SUPREME COURT AND MANY LOWER COURTS. IF THE SUPREME COURT DECIDES THAT A LAW IS NOT ALLOWED BY THE CONSTITUTION THE LAW IS SAID TO BE STRUCK DOWN AND IS NO LONGER A VALID LAW.
THE SUPREME COURT IS MADE UP OF NINE JUDGES CALLED JUSTICES WHO ARE NOMINATED BY THE PRESIDENT AND CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE. ONE OF THESE JUSTICES CALLED THE CHIEF JUSTICE HEADS THE COURT. A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SERVES UNTIL HE OR SHE DIES OR RESIGNS QUITS IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OR HER TERM. WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE PRESIDENT NOMINATES SOMEONE NEW TO REPLACE THE JUSTICE WHO LEFT. IF THE SENATE AGREES WITH THAT CHOICE THE PERSON BECOMES A JUSTICE. IF THE SENATE DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT S CHOICE THEN THE PRESIDENT MUST NOMINATE SOMEONE ELSE.
FAMOUS COURT CASES SUCH AS MARBURY V. MADISON WHICH WAS DECIDED IN 1803 HAVE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED THAT THE SUPREME COURT IS THE ULTIMATE INTERPRETER OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND HAS THE POWER TO STRIKE DOWN ANY LAW THAT CONFLICTS WITH IT.
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CONSISTS OF 50 STATES 5 TERRITORIES AND 1 DISTRICT WASHINGTON D.C.. STATES CAN MAKE LAWS ABOUT THINGS INSIDE THE STATE BUT FEDERAL LAW IS ABOUT THINGS DEALING WITH MORE THAN ONE STATE OR DEALING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. IN SOME AREAS IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKES LAWS THAT SAY DIFFERENT THINGS FROM THE STATE LAWS PEOPLE MUST FOLLOW THE FEDERAL LAW BECAUSE THE STATE LAW IS NOT A LAW ANY MORE. EACH STATE HAS A CONSTITUTION OF ITS OWN DIFFERENT FROM THE FEDERAL NATIONAL CONSTITUTION. EACH OF THESE IS LIKE THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION BECAUSE THEY SAY HOW EACH STATE S GOVERNMENT IS SET UP BUT SOME ALSO TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC LAWS.
THE FEDERAL AND MOST STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE DOMINATED BY TWO POLITICAL PARTIES THE REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATS. THERE ARE MANY SMALLER PARTIES THE LARGEST OF THESE ARE THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY AND THE GREEN PARTY. PEOPLE HELP IN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS THAT THEY LIKE. THEY TRY TO PERSUADE POLITICIANS TO HELP THEM THIS IS CALLED LOBBYING. ALL AMERICANS ARE ALLOWED TO DO THESE THINGS BUT SOME HAVE AND SPEND MORE MONEY THAN OTHERS OR IN OTHER WAYS DO MORE IN POLITICS. SOME PEOPLE THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM AND LOBBY FOR RULES TO BE MADE TO CHANGE IT.
SINCE 2017 THE PRESIDENT IS A REPUBLICAN AND CONGRESS IS ALSO REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED SO THE REPUBLICANS HAVE MORE POWER IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THERE ARE STILL MANY POWERFUL DEMOCRATS WHO CAN TRY TO STOP THE REPUBLICANS FROM DOING THINGS THAT THEY BELIEVE WILL BE BAD FOR THE COUNTRY. ALSO MEMBERS OF A PARTY IN POWER DO NOT ALWAYS AGREE ON WHAT TO DO. IF ENOUGH PEOPLE DECIDE TO VOTE AGAINST REPUBLICANS IN THE NEXT ELECTION THEY WILL LOSE POWER. IN A REPUBLIC LIKE THE UNITED STATES NO PARTY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. ALL POLITICIANS HAVE TO ARGUE COMPROMISE AND MAKE DEALS WITH EACH OTHER TO GET THINGS DONE. THEY HAVE TO ANSWER TO THE PEOPLE AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR MISTAKES.
THE USA S LARGE CULTURAL ECONOMIC AND MILITARY INFLUENCE HAS MADE THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES OR RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES A TOPIC IN AMERICAN POLITICS AND THE POLITICS OF MANY OTHER COUNTRIES.
RUSSIA USA 07 2017 
THE UNITED STATES CONQUERED AND BOUGHT NEW LANDS OVER TIME AND GREW FROM THE ORIGINAL 13 COLONIES IN THE EAST TO THE CURRENT 50 STATES OF WHICH 48 OF THEM ARE JOINED TOGETHER TO MAKE UP THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES. THESE STATES CALLED THE LOWER 48 CAN ALL BE REACHED BY ROAD WITHOUT CROSSING A BORDER INTO ANOTHER COUNTRY. THEY GO FROM THE ATLANTIC EAST TO THE PACIFIC IN THE WEST. THERE ARE TWO OTHER STATES WHICH ARE NOT JOINED TO THE LOWER 48 STATES. ALASKA CAN BE REACHED BY PASSING THROUGH BRITISH COLUMBIA AND THE YUKON BOTH OF WHICH ARE PART OF CANADA. HAWAII IS LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND IS SO FAR FROM THE REST OF THE US THAT IT CAN ONLY BE REACHED BY AIRPLANE.
WASHINGTON D.C. THE NATIONAL CAPITAL IS A FEDERAL DISTRICT THAT WAS SPLIT FROM THE STATES OF MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA IN 1791. NOT PART OF ANY US STATE IT USED TO BE IN THE SHAPE OF A SQUARE WITH THE LAND WEST OF THE POTOMAC RIVER COMING FROM VIRGINIA AND THE LAND EAST OF THE RIVER COMING FROM MARYLAND. IN 1846 VIRGINIA TOOK BACK ITS PART OF THE LAND. SOME PEOPLE LIVING IN DC WANTS IT TO BECOME A STATE OR FOR MARYLAND TO TAKE BACK ITS LAND SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN CONGRESS.
THE UNITED STATES CONSISTS OF SIXTEEN LANDS THAT ARE NOT STATES MANY OF WHICH ARE COLONIAL TERRITORIES. NONE OF THEM HAVE ANY LAND BORDERS WITH THE REST OF THE US. PEOPLE LIVE IN FIVE OF THESE PLACES WHICH ARE DE FACTO AMERICAN 
THE PHILIPPINES WAS A POSSESSION OF THE UNITED STATES. PALAU THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA AND OTHER PACIFIC ISLAND NATIONS WERE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED STATES AS A UNITED NATIONS TRUST TERRITORY. ALL OF THESE PLACES HAVE BECOME INDEPENDENT THE PHILIPPINES IN 1946 PALAU IN 1947 AND MICRONESIA IN 1986.
THE U.S. ARMED FORCES HAS BASES IN MANY COUNTRIES AND THE U.S. NAVY S BASE AT GUANTANAMO BAY WAS RENTED FROM CUBA AFTER THAT COUNTRY HAD A COMMUNIST REVOLUTION.
ALL THE STATES ARE DIVIDED INTO ADMINISTRATIVE SUBDIVISIONS. MOST OF THEM ARE CALLED COUNTIES BUT LOUISIANA USES THE WORD PARISH AND ALASKA USES THE WORD BOROUGH. 
THERE ARE MANY CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. ONE CITY IN EACH STATE IS THE STATE CAPITAL WHERE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE MEETS AND THE GOVERNOR WORKS. THIS CITY IS NOT ALWAYS THE LARGEST IN ITS STATE. FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY WITH THE MOST PEOPLE LIVING IN IT IS NEW YORK CITY IN NEW YORK STATE BUT THE STATE CAPITAL IS ALBANY. SOME OTHER BIG CITIES ARE LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA CHICAGO ILLINOIS SEATTLE WASHINGTON MIAMI FLORIDA INDIANAPOLIS INDIANA LAS VEGAS NEVADA HOUSTON AND DALLAS TEXAS PHILADELPHIA AND PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA BOSTON MASSACHUSETTS DENVER COLORADO ST. LOUIS MISSOURI AND DETROIT MICHIGAN.
THE UNITED STATES IS THE FOURTH BIGGEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD BY LAND AREA. ONLY RUSSIA CANADA AND CHINA ARE BIGGER. THE U.S S GEOGRAPHY VARIES A LOT AND INCLUDES 
THE CLIMATE VARIES ALONG WITH THE GEOGRAPHY FROM TROPICAL HOT AND WET IN SUMMER WARM AND DRY IN WINTER IN FLORIDA TO TUNDRA COLD ALL YEAR IN ALASKA. LARGE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HAVE WARM SUMMERS AND COLD WINTERS. SOME PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES LIKE PARTS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE.
THE UNITED STATES HAS A CAPITALIST ECONOMY. THE COUNTRY HAS RICH MINERAL RESOURCES WITH MANY GOLD COAL AND URANIUM DEPOSITS. FARMING MAKES THE COUNTRY AMONG THE TOP PRODUCERS OF AMONG OTHERS CORN MAIZE WHEAT SUGAR AND TOBACCO. AMERICA PRODUCES CARS AIRPLANES AND ELECTRONICS. ABOUT 3 4 OF AMERICANS WORK IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY.
THE TOP 15 TRADING PARTNERS IN TERMS OF TOTAL TRADE ARE 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS PEOPLE OF MANY DIFFERENT RACE AND ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS. 80 OF THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES DESCEND FROM EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS. MANY PEOPLE ARE DESCENDED FROM GERMANY ENGLAND SCOTLAND IRELAND AFRICA AND ITALY. 13 OF THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN. MOST OF THEM DESCEND FROM THE AFRICAN SLAVES THAT WERE BROUGHT TO AMERICA. ASIAN AMERICANS MAKE UP ONLY 5 OF THE POPULATION IN AMERICA BUT MAKE UP A BIGGER PORTION IN THE WEST COAST. FOR EXAMPLE IN CALIFORNIA ASIAN AMERICANS MAKE UP 13 OF THE POPULATION OF THAT STATE. HISPANIC AMERICANS OR PEOPLE OF LATIN ORIGINS MAKE UP 15 OF THE NATION. THE ORIGINAL PEOPLES CALLED NATIVE AMERICAN AMERICAN INDIANS OR AMERINDIANS AND INUIT ESKIMOS ARE A VERY SMALL GROUP.
11 OF THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES ARE FOREIGN BORN. 18 SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME. FOR PEOPLE 25 AND OLDER 80 ARE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES WHILE 25 HAVE A BACHELOR S DEGREE OR HIGHER.
THE 2000 CENSUS COUNTED SELF REPORTED ANCESTRY. IT IDENTIFIED 43 MILLION GERMAN AMERICANS 30.5 MILLION IRISH AMERICANS 24.9 MILLION AFRICAN AMERICANS 24.5 MILLION ENGLISH AMERICANS AND 18.4 MILLION MEXICAN AMERICANS.
THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE UNITED STATES HAS A BIG RANGE. THIS MEANS THAT SOME AMERICANS ARE MUCH MUCH RICHER THAN OTHERS. THE AVERAGE MEDIAN INCOME FOR AN AMERICAN WAS 37 000 A YEAR IN 2002. HOWEVER THE RICHEST 1 OF AMERICANS HAVE AS MUCH MONEY AS THE POOREST 90. 51 OF ALL HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPUTER AND 41 HAD ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IN 2000 A FIGURE WHICH HAD GROWN TO 75 IN 2004. ALSO 67.9 OF AMERICAN FAMILIES OWNED THEIR HOMES IN 2002. THERE ARE 200 MILLION CARS IN THE UNITED STATES TWO FOR EVERY THREE AMERICANS. THE DEBT HAS GROWN TO OVER 16 000 000 000 000.
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT RELIGIONS IN THE U.S. STATISTICALLY THE LARGEST RELIGION IS CHRISTIANITY INCLUDING GROUPS SUCH AS CATHOLICISM PROTESTANTISM AND MORMONISM. OTHER RELIGIONS INCLUDE HINDUISM ISLAM JUDAISM UNITARIAN UNIVERSALISM WICCA DRUIDRY BAHA I RAELISM ZOROASTRIANISM TAOISM AND JAINISM. RELIGIONS WHICH WERE FOUNDED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE ECKANKAR SATANISM AND SCIENTOLOGY. NATIVE AMERICAN RELIGIONS HAVE VARIOUS ANIMISTIC BELIEFS.
THE UNITED STATES IS ONE OF THE MOST RELIGIOUS COUNTRIES IN THE WESTERN WORLD AND MOST AMERICANS BELIEVE IN GOD. THE NUMBER OF CHRISTIANS IN THE U.S. HAS GONE DOWN. 86.2 CALLED THEMSELVES CHRISTIAN IN 1990 AND 78.4 SAID THIS IN 2007. THE OTHERS INCLUDE JUDAISM 1.7 ISLAM 0.8 BUDDHISM 0.7 HINDUISM 0.4 AND UNITARIAN UNIVERSALISM 0.3. THOSE WHO HAVE NO RELIGION ARE AT 16.1. THERE IS A LARGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE WHO SAY THAT THEY BELONG TO A RELIGION AND THOSE WHO ARE MEMBERS OF A RELIGIOUS BODY OF THAT RELIGION.
DOUBTS ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD GODS OR GODDESSES ARE HIGHER AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. CITATION NEEDED AMONG THE NON RELIGIOUS POPULATION OF THE U.S. THERE ARE DEISTS HUMANISTS IGNOTIC ATHEISTS AND AGNOSTICS.
THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS HAS CONSIDERED OFFICIALLY DESIGNATING ENGLISH AS SUCH FOR MANY YEARS SINCE IT IS THE MOST USED LANGUAGE AND THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION ARE WRITTEN. 38 STATES OUT OF 50 HAVE ENGLISH AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE. SPANISH HAS INCREASED IN USAGE IN CERTAIN SECTORS OF SOCIETY DUE TO A FLOW OF IMMIGRANTS ESPECIALLY FROM MEXICO AND CUBA. FRENCH IS ALSO A MAIN LANGUAGE IN PARTS OF LOUISIANA BECAUSE FRANCE ONCE OWNED THE AREA AS A COLONY.
AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE GOES OUT TO MANY PLACES IN THE WORLD. IT HAS A LARGE INFLUENCE ON MOST OF THE WORLD ESPECIALLY THE WESTERN WORLD. AMERICAN MUSIC IS HEARD ALL OVER THE WORLD AND AMERICAN MOVIES AND TELEVISION SHOWS CAN BE SEEN IN MOST COUNTRIES.
THE AMERICAN FLAG IS MADE UP OF 50 STARS ON A BLUE BACKGROUND AND HAS 13 STRIPES SEVEN RED AND SIX WHITE. IT IS ONE OF MANY SYMBOLS OF THE UNITED STATES LIKE THE BALD EAGLE. THE 50 STARS REPRESENT THE 50 STATES. THE RED STANDS FOR COURAGE. THE BLUE STANDS FOR JUSTICE. THE WHITE REPRESENTS PEACE AND CLEANNESS. THE 13 STRIPES REPRESENT THE 13 ORIGINAL COLONIES.
UNIVERSE
UNIVERSE IS THE NAME THAT WE USE TO DESCRIBE THE COLLECTION OF ALL THE THINGS THAT EXIST IN SPACE. IT IS MADE OF BILLIONS OF STARS AND PLANETS AND ENORMOUS CLOUDS OF GAS SEPARATED BY A GIGANTIC EMPTY SPACE WHICH IS CALLED THE UNIVERSE.
ASTRONOMERS CAN USE TELESCOPES TO LOOK AT VERY DISTANT GALAXIES. THIS IS HOW THEY SEE WHAT THE UNIVERSE LOOKED LIKE A LONG TIME AGO. THIS IS BECAUSE THE LIGHT FROM DISTANT PARTS OF THE UNIVERSE TAKES A VERY LONG TIME TO REACH US. FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS IT SEEMS THE PHYSICAL LAWS AND CONSTANTS OF THE UNIVERSE HAVE NOT CHANGED.
PHYSICISTS ARE CURRENTLY UNSURE IF ANYTHING EXISTED BEFORE THE BIG BANG. THEY ARE ALSO UNSURE WHETHER THE SIZE OF THE UNIVERSE IS INFINITE.
MANY PEOPLE IN HISTORY HAD IDEAS TO EXPLAIN THE UNIVERSE. MOST EARLY MODELS HAD THE EARTH AT THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE. SOME ANCIENT GREEKS THOUGHT THAT THE UNIVERSE HAS INFINITE SPACE AND HAS EXISTED FOREVER. THEY THOUGHT IT HAD A SET OF SPHERES WHICH CORRESPONDED TO THE FIXED STARS THE SUN AND VARIOUS PLANETS. THE SPHERES CIRCLED ABOUT A SPHERICAL BUT UNMOVING EARTH. 
OVER THE CENTURIES BETTER OBSERVATIONS AND BETTER IDEAS OF GRAVITY LED TO COPERNICUS S SUN CENTRED MODEL. THIS WAS HUGELY CONTROVERSIAL AT THE TIME AND WAS FOUGHT LONG AND HARD BY AUTHORITIES OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH SEE GIORDANO BRUNO AND GALILEO.
THE INVENTION OF THE TELESCOPE IN THE NETHERLANDS 1608 WAS A MILESTONE IN ASTRONOMY. BY THE MID 19TH CENTURY THEY WERE GOOD ENOUGH FOR OTHER GALAXIES TO BE DISTINGUISHED. THE MODERN OPTICAL USES VISIBLE LIGHT TELESCOPE IS STILL MORE ADVANCED. MEANWHILE THE NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS EQUATIONS SHOWED HOW THE SOLAR SYSTEM WORKED. 
THE IMPROVEMENT OF TELESCMEEPOPES LED ASTRONOMERS TO REALISE THAT THE SOLAR SYSTEM IS IN A GALAXY MADE OF BILLIONS OF STARS THE MILKY WAY AND THAT OTHER GALAXIES EXIST OUTSIDE IT AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE. CAREFUL STUDIES OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE GALAXIES AND THEIR SPECTRAL LINES HAVE LED TO MUCH OF MODERN COSMOLOGY. DISCOVERY OF THE REDSHIFT SHOWED THAT THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING SEE HUBBLE. 
THE MOST USED SCIENTIFIC MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE IS KNOWN AS THE BIG BANG THEORY. THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED FROM A VERY HOT DENSE PHASE CALLED THE PLANCK EPOCH IN WHICH ALL THE MATTER AND ENERGY OF THE UNIVERSE WAS CONCENTRATED. SEVERAL INDEPENDENT EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF SPACE AND MORE GENERALLY THE BIG BANG IDEA. RECENT OBSERVATIONS SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT THIS EXPANSION IS HAPPENING BECAUSE OF DARK ENERGY. MOST OF THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE MAY BE IN A FORM WHICH CANNOT BE DETECTED BY PRESENT METHODS. THIS HAS BEEN NAMED DARK MATTER.
JUST TO BE CLEAR DARK MATTER AND ENERGY HAVE NOT BEEN DETECTED DIRECTLY THAT IS WHY THEY ARE CALLED DARK. THEIR EXISTENCE IS INFERRED BY DEDUCTION FROM OBSERVATIONS WHICH WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN OTHERWISE.
CURRENT THINKING IN COSMOLOGY IS THAT THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE IS 13.73 0.12 BILLION YEARS AND THAT THE DIAMETER OF THE UNIVERSE IS AT LEAST 93 BILLION LIGHT YEARS OR 8.80 METRES. 
ACCORDING TO GENERAL RELATIVITY SPACE CAN GET BIGGER FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT BUT WE CAN VIEW ONLY PART OF THE UNIVERSE BECAUSE OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT. WE CANNOT SEE SPACE BEYOND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIGHT OR ANY ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION.
THE WORD UNIVERSE COMES FROM THE OLD FRENCH WORD UNIVERS WHICH COMES FROM THE LATIN WORD UNIVERSUM. THE LATIN WORD WAS USED BY CICERO AND LATER LATIN AUTHORS IN MANY OF THE SAME SENSES AS THE MODERN ENGLISH WORD IS USED. 
A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION WAY TO INTERPRET OF UNVORSUM IS EVERYTHING ROTATED AS ONE OR EVERYTHING ROTATED BY ONE. THIS REFERS TO AN EARLY GREEK MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE. IN THAT MODEL ALL MATTER WAS IN ROTATING SPHERES CENTERED ON THE EARTH ACCORDING TO ARISTOTLE THE ROTATION OF THE OUTERMOST SPHERE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOTION AND CHANGE OF EVERYTHING WITHIN. IT WAS NATURAL FOR THE GREEKS TO ASSUME THAT THE EARTH WAS STATIONARY AND THAT THE HEAVENS ROTATED ABOUT THE EARTH BECAUSE CAREFUL ASTRONOMICAL AND PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS SUCH AS THE FOUCAULT PENDULUM ARE REQUIRED TO PROVE OTHERWISE.
THE MOST COMMON TERM FOR UNIVERSE AMONG THE ANCIENT GREEK PHILOSOPHERS FROM PYTHAGORAS ONWARDS WAS THE ALL DEFINED AS ALL MATTER AND ALL SPACE.
THE BROADEST WORD MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE IS FOUND IN DE DIVISIONE NATURAE BY THE MEDIEVAL PHILOSOPHER JOHANNES SCOTUS ERIUGENA WHO DEFINED IT AS SIMPLY EVERYTHING EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS AND EVERYTHING THAT DOES NOT EXIST.
TIME IS NOT CONSIDERED IN ERIUGENA S DEFINITION THUS HIS DEFINITION INCLUDES EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS HAS EXISTED AND WILL EXIST AS WELL AS EVERYTHING THAT DOES NOT EXIST HAS NEVER EXISTED AND WILL NEVER EXIST. THIS ALL EMBRACING DEFINITION WAS NOT ADOPTED BY MOST LATER PHILOSOPHERS BUT SOMETHING SIMILAR IS IN QUANTUM PHYSICS.
USUALLY THE UNIVERSE IS THOUGHT TO BE EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS HAS EXISTED AND WILL EXIST. THIS DEFINITION SAYS THAT THE UNIVERSE IS MADE OF TWO ELEMENTS SPACE AND TIME TOGETHER KNOWN AS SPACE TIME OR THE VACUUM AND MATTER AND DIFFERENT FORMS OF ENERGY AND MOMENTUM OCCUPYING SPACE TIME. THE TWO KINDS OF ELEMENTS BEHAVE ACCORDING TO PHYSICAL LAWS IN WHICH WE DESCRIBE HOW THE ELEMENTS INTERACT. 
A SIMILAR DEFINITION OF THE TERM UNIVERSE IS EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS AT A SINGLE MOMENT OF TIME SUCH AS THE PRESENT OR THE BEGINNING OF TIME AS IN THE SENTENCE THE UNIVERSE WAS OF SIZE 0.
IN ARISTOTLE S BOOK THE PHYSICS ARISTOTLE DIVIDED EVERYTHING INTO THREE ROUGHLY ANALOGOUS ELEMENTS MATTER THE STUFF OF WHICH THE UNIVERSE IS MADE FORM THE ARRANGEMENT OF THAT MATTER IN SPACE AND CHANGE HOW MATTER IS CREATED DESTROYED OR ALTERED IN ITS PROPERTIES AND SIMILARLY HOW FORM IS ALTERED. PHYSICAL LAWS WERE THE RULES GOVERNING THE PROPERTIES OF MATTER FORM AND THEIR CHANGES. LATER PHILOSOPHERS SUCH AS LUCRETIUS AVERROES AVICENNA AND BARUCH SPINOZA ALTERED OR REFINED THESE DIVISIONS. FOR EXAMPLE AVERROES AND SPINOZA HAVE ACTIVE PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE UNIVERSE WHICH ACT ON PASSIVE ELEMENTS.
IT IS POSSIBLE TO FORM SPACE TIMES EACH EXISTING BUT NOT ABLE TO TOUCH MOVE OR CHANGE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. AN EASY WAY TO THINK OF THIS IS A GROUP OF SEPARATE SOAP BUBBLES IN WHICH PEOPLE LIVING ON ONE SOAP BUBBLE CANNOT INTERACT WITH THOSE ON OTHER SOAP BUBBLES. ACCORDING TO ONE COMMON TERMINOLOGY EACH SOAP BUBBLE OF SPACE TIME IS DENOTED AS A UNIVERSE WHEREAS OUR PARTICULAR SPACE TIME IS DENOTED AS THE UNIVERSE JUST AS WE CALL OUR MOON THE MOON. THE ENTIRE COLLECTION OF THESE SEPARATE SPACE TIMES IS DENOTED AS THE MULTIVERSE. IN PRINCIPLE THE OTHER UNCONNECTED UNIVERSES MAY HAVE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONALITIES AND TOPOLOGIES OF SPACE TIME DIFFERENT FORMS OF MATTER AND ENERGY AND DIFFERENT PHYSICAL LAWS AND PHYSICAL CONSTANTS ALTHOUGH SUCH POSSIBILITIES ARE SPECULATIONS.
ACCORDING TO A STILL MORE RESTRICTIVE DEFINITION THE UNIVERSE IS EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR CONNECTED SPACE TIME THAT COULD HAVE A CHANCE TO INTERACT WITH US AND VICE VERSA. 
ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL IDEA OF RELATIVITY SOME REGIONS OF SPACE MAY NEVER INTERACT WITH OURS EVEN IN THE LIFETIME OF THE UNIVERSE DUE TO THE FINITE SPEED OF LIGHT AND THE ONGOING EXPANSION OF SPACE. FOR EXAMPLE RADIO MESSAGES SENT FROM EARTH MAY NEVER REACH SOME REGIONS OF SPACE EVEN IF THE UNIVERSE WOULD EXIST FOREVER SPACE MAY EXPAND FASTER THAN LIGHT CAN TRAVERSE IT. 
IT IS WORTH EMPHASIZING THAT THOSE DISTANT REGIONS OF SPACE ARE TAKEN TO EXIST AND BE PART OF REALITY AS MUCH AS WE ARE YET WE CAN NEVER INTERACT WITH THEM EVEN IN PRINCIPLE. THE SPATIAL REGION WITHIN WHICH WE CAN AFFECT AND BE AFFECTED IS DENOTED AS THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE. 
STRICTLY SPEAKING THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE DEPENDS ON THE LOCATION OF THE OBSERVER. BY TRAVELING AN OBSERVER CAN COME INTO CONTACT WITH A GREATER REGION OF SPACE TIME THAN AN OBSERVER WHO REMAINS STILL SO THAT THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE FOR THE FORMER IS LARGER THAN FOR THE LATTER. NEVERTHELESS EVEN THE MOST RAPID TRAVELER MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH ALL OF SPACE. TYPICALLY THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE MEANS THE UNIVERSE SEEN FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT IN THE MILKY WAY GALAXY.
THE UNIVERSE IS HUGE AND POSSIBLY INFINITE IN VOLUME. THE MATTER WHICH CAN BE SEEN IS SPREAD OVER A SPACE AT LEAST 93 BILLION LIGHT YEARS ACROSS. FOR COMPARISON THE DIAMETER OF A TYPICAL GALAXY IS ONLY 30 000 LIGHT YEARS AND THE TYPICAL DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO NEIGHBORING GALAXIES IS ONLY 3 MILLION LIGHT YEARS. AS AN EXAMPLE OUR MILKY WAY GALAXY IS ROUGHLY 100 000 LIGHT YEARS IN DIAMETER AND OUR NEAREST SISTER GALAXY THE ANDROMEDA GALAXY IS LOCATED ROUGHLY 2.5 MILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY. THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE THAN 100 BILLION 10 GALAXIES IN THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE. TYPICAL GALAXIES RANGE FROM DWARF GALAXYS WITH AS FEW AS TEN MILLION 10 STARS UP TO GIANTS WITH ONE TRILLION 10 STARS ALL ORBITING THE GALAXY S CENTER OF MASS. THUS A VERY ROUGH ESTIMATE FROM THESE NUMBERS WOULD SUGGEST THERE ARE AROUND ONE SEXTILLION 10 STARS IN THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE THOUGH A 2003 STUDY BY AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY ASTRONOMERS RESULTED IN A FIGURE OF 70 SEXTILLION 7 X 10.
THE MATTER THAT CAN BE SEEN IS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE WHEN AVERAGED OVER DISTANCES LONGER THAN 300 MILLION LIGHT YEARS. HOWEVER ON SMALLER LENGTH SCALES MATTER IS OBSERVED TO FORM CLUMPS MANY ATOMS ARE CONDENSED INTO STARS MOST STARS INTO GALAXIES MOST GALAXIES INTO GALAXY GROUPS AND CLUSTERS AND LASTLY THE LARGEST SCALE STRUCTURES SUCH AS THE GREAT WALL OF GALAXIES. 
THE PRESENT OVERALL DENSITY OF THE UNIVERSE IS VERY LOW ROUGHLY 9.9 10 GRAMS PER CUBIC CENTIMETRE. THIS MASS ENERGY APPEARS TO CONSIST OF 73 DARK ENERGY 23 COLD DARK MATTER AND 4 ORDINARY MATTER. THE DENSITY OF ATOMS IS ABOUT A SINGLE HYDROGEN ATOM FOR EVERY FOUR CUBIC METERS OF VOLUME. THE PROPERTIES OF DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER ARE NOT KNOWN. DARK MATTER SLOWS THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE. DARK ENERGY MAKES ITS EXPANSION FASTER.
THE UNIVERSE IS OLD AND CHANGING. THE BEST GOOD GUESS OF THE UNIVERSE S AGE IS 13.798 0.037 BILLION YEARS OLD BASED ON WHAT WAS SEEN OF THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND RADIATION. INDEPENDENT ESTIMATES BASED ON MEASUREMENTS SUCH AS RADIOACTIVE DATING AGREE ALTHOUGH THEY ARE LESS PRECISE RANGING FROM 11 20 BILLION YEARS
TO 13 15 BILLION YEARS. 
THE UNIVERSE HAS NOT BEEN THE SAME AT ALL TIMES IN ITS HISTORY. THIS GETTING BIGGER ACCOUNTS FOR HOW EARTH BOUND PEOPLE CAN SEE THE LIGHT FROM A GALAXY 30 BILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY EVEN IF THAT LIGHT HAS TRAVELED FOR ONLY 13 BILLION YEARS THE VERY SPACE BETWEEN THEM HAS EXPANDED. THIS EXPANSION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OBSERVATION THAT THE LIGHT FROM DISTANT GALAXIES HAS BEEN REDSHIFTED THE PHOTONS EMITTED HAVE BEEN STRETCHED TO LONGER WAVELENGTHS AND LOWER FREQUENCY DURING THEIR JOURNEY. THE RATE OF THIS SPATIAL EXPANSION IS ACCELERATING BASED ON STUDIES OF TYPE IA SUPERNOVAE AND OTHER DATA.
THE RELATIVE AMOUNTS OF DIFFERENT CHEMICAL ELEMENTS ESPECIALLY THE LIGHTEST ATOMS SUCH AS HYDROGEN DEUTERIUM AND HELIUM SEEM TO BE IDENTICAL IN ALL OF THE UNIVERSE AND THROUGHOUT ALL OF THE HISTORY OF IT THAT WE KNOW OF. THE UNIVERSE SEEMS TO HAVE MUCH MORE MATTER THAN ANTIMATTER. THE UNIVERSE APPEARS TO HAVE NO NET ELECTRIC CHARGE. GRAVITY IS THE DOMINANT INTERACTION AT COSMOLOGICAL DISTANCES. THE UNIVERSE ALSO SEEMS TO HAVE NO NET MOMENTUM OR ANGULAR MOMENTUM. THE ABSENCE OF NET CHARGE AND MOMENTUM IS EXPECTED IF THE UNIVERSE IS FINITE.
THE UNIVERSE APPEARS TO HAVE A SMOOTH SPACE TIME CONTINUUM MADE OF THREE SPATIAL DIMENSIONS AND ONE TEMPORAL TIME DIMENSION. ON THE AVERAGE SPACE IS VERY NEARLY FLAT CLOSE TO ZERO CURVATURE MEANING THAT EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY IS EXPERIMENTALLY TRUE WITH HIGH ACCURACY THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE UNIVERSE. HOWEVER THE UNIVERSE MAY HAVE MORE DIMENSIONS AND ITS SPACETIME MAY HAVE A MULTIPLY CONNECTED GLOBAL TOPOLOGY.
THE UNIVERSE HAS THE SAME PHYSICAL LAWS AND PHYSICAL CONSTANTS THROUGHOUT. ACCORDING TO THE PREVAILING STANDARD MODEL OF PHYSICS ALL MATTER IS COMPOSED OF THREE GENERATIONS OF LEPTONS AND QUARKS BOTH OF WHICH ARE FERMIONS. THESE ELEMENTARY PARTICLES INTERACT VIA AT MOST THREE FUNDAMENTAL INTERACTIONS THE ELECTROWEAK INTERACTION WHICH INCLUDES ELECTROMAGNETISM AND THE WEAK NUCLEAR FORCE THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE DESCRIBED BY QUANTUM CHROMODYNAMICS AND GRAVITY WHICH IS BEST DESCRIBED AT PRESENT BY GENERAL RELATIVITY. 
SPECIAL RELATIVITY HOLDS IN ALL THE UNIVERSE IN LOCAL SPACE AND TIME. OTHERWISE GENERAL RELATIVITY HOLDS. THERE IS NO EXPLANATION FOR THE PARTICULAR VALUES THAT PHYSICAL CONSTANTS APPEAR TO HAVE THROUGHOUT OUR UNIVERSE SUCH AS PLANCK S CONSTANT H OR THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT G. SEVERAL CONSERVATION LAWS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED SUCH AS THE CONSERVATION OF CHARGE CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND CONSERVATION OF ENERGY.
ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE UNIVERSE S PAST AND FUTURE REQUIRE AN ACCURATE THEORY OF GRAVITATION. THE BEST THEORY AVAILABLE IS ALBERT EINSTEIN S GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY WHICH HAS PASSED ALL EXPERIMENTAL TESTS SO FAR. HOWEVER SINCE RIGOROUS EXPERIMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN CARRIED OUT ON COSMOLOGICAL LENGTH SCALES GENERAL RELATIVITY COULD CONCEIVABLY BE INACCURATE. NEVERTHELESS ITS PREDICTIONS APPEAR TO BE CONSISTENT WITH OBSERVATIONS SO THERE IS NO REASON TO ADOPT ANOTHER THEORY.
GENERAL RELATIVITY PROVIDES OF A SET OF TEN NONLINEAR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS FOR THE SPACETIME METRIC EINSTEIN S FIELD EQUATIONS THAT MUST BE SOLVED FROM THE DISTRIBUTION OF MASS ENERGY AND MOMENTUM THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE. SINCE THESE ARE UNKNOWN IN EXACT DETAIL COSMOLOGICAL MODELS HAVE BEEN BASED ON THE COSMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE WHICH STATES THAT THE UNIVERSE IS HOMOGENEOUS AND ISOTROPIC. IN EFFECT THIS PRINCIPLE ASSERTS THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS OF THE VARIOUS GALAXIES MAKING UP THE UNIVERSE ARE EQUIVALENT TO THOSE OF A FINE DUST DISTRIBUTED UNIFORMLY THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE WITH THE SAME AVERAGE DENSITY. THE ASSUMPTION OF A UNIFORM DUST MAKES IT EASY TO SOLVE EINSTEIN S FIELD EQUATIONS AND PREDICT THE PAST AND FUTURE OF THE UNIVERSE ON COSMOLOGICAL TIME SCALES.
EINSTEIN S FIELD EQUATIONS INCLUDE A COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT LAMDA THAT IS RELATED TO AN ENERGY DENSITY OF EMPTY SPACE. DEPENDING ON ITS SIGN THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT CAN EITHER SLOW NEGATIVE OR ACCELERATE POSITIVE THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE. ALTHOUGH MANY SCIENTISTS INCLUDING EINSTEIN HAD SPECULATED THAT WAS ZERO RECENT ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS OF TYPE IA SUPERNOVAE HAVE DETECTED A LARGE AMOUNT OF DARK ENERGY THAT IS ACCELERATING THE UNIVERSE S EXPANSION. PRELIMINARY STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THIS DARK ENERGY IS RELATED TO A POSITIVE ALTHOUGH ALTERNATIVE THEORIES CANNOT BE RULED OUT AS YET.
THE PREVAILING BIG BANG MODEL ACCOUNTS FOR MANY OF THE EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE SUCH AS THE CORRELATION OF DISTANCE AND REDSHIFT OF GALAXIES THE UNIVERSAL RATIO OF HYDROGEN HELIUM ATOMS AND THE UBIQUITOUS ISOTROPIC MICROWAVE RADIATION BACKGROUND. AS NOTED ABOVE THE REDSHIFT ARISES FROM THE METRIC EXPANSION OF SPACE AS THE SPACE ITSELF EXPANDS THE WAVELENGTH OF A PHOTON TRAVELING THROUGH SPACE LIKEWISE INCREASES DECREASING ITS ENERGY. THE LONGER A PHOTON HAS BEEN TRAVELING THE MORE EXPANSION IT HAS UNDERGONE HENCE OLDER PHOTONS FROM MORE DISTANT GALAXIES ARE THE MOST RED SHIFTED. DETERMINING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN DISTANCE AND REDSHIFT IS AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM IN EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICAL COSMOLOGY.
OTHER EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY COMBINING THE OVERALL EXPANSION OF SPACE WITH NUCLEAR AND ATOMIC PHYSICS. AS THE UNIVERSE EXPANDS THE ENERGY DENSITY OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION DECREASES MORE QUICKLY THAN DOES THAT OF MATTER SINCE THE ENERGY OF A PHOTON DECREASES WITH ITS WAVELENGTH. THUS ALTHOUGH THE ENERGY DENSITY OF THE UNIVERSE IS NOW DOMINATED BY MATTER IT WAS ONCE DOMINATED BY RADIATION POETICALLY SPEAKING ALL WAS LIGHT. AS THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED ITS ENERGY DENSITY DECREASED AND IT BECAME COOLER AS IT DID SO THE ELEMENTARY PARTICLES OF MATTER COULD ASSOCIATE STABLY INTO EVER LARGER COMBINATIONS. THUS IN THE EARLY PART OF THE MATTER DOMINATED ERA STABLE PROTONS AND NEUTRONS FORMED WHICH THEN ASSOCIATED INTO ATOMIC NUCLEI. AT THIS STAGE THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE WAS MAINLY A HOT DENSE PLASMA OF NEGATIVE ELECTRONS NEUTRAL NEUTRINOS AND POSITIVE NUCLEI. NUCLEAR REACTIONS AMONG THE NUCLEI LED TO THE PRESENT ABUNDANCES OF THE LIGHTER NUCLEI PARTICULARLY HYDROGEN DEUTERIUM AND HELIUM. EVENTUALLY THE ELECTRONS AND NUCLEI COMBINED TO FORM STABLE ATOMS WHICH ARE TRANSPARENT TO MOST WAVELENGTHS OF RADIATION AT THIS POINT THE RADIATION DECOUPLED FROM THE MATTER FORMING THE UBIQUITOUS ISOTROPIC BACKGROUND OF MICROWAVE RADIATION OBSERVED TODAY.
OTHER OBSERVATIONS ARE NOT CLEARLY ANSWERED BY KNOWN PHYSICS. ACCORDING TO THE PREVAILING THEORY A SLIGHT IMBALANCE OF MATTER OVER ANTIMATTER WAS PRESENT IN THE UNIVERSE S CREATION OR DEVELOPED VERY SHORTLY THEREAFTER. ALTHOUGH THE MATTER AND ANTIMATTER MOSTLY ANNIHILATED ONE ANOTHER PRODUCING PHOTONS A SMALL RESIDUE OF MATTER SURVIVED GIVING THE PRESENT MATTER DOMINATED UNIVERSE. 
SEVERAL LINES OF EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGEST THAT A RAPID COSMIC INFLATION OF THE UNIVERSE OCCURRED VERY EARLY IN ITS HISTORY ROUGHLY 10 SECONDS AFTER ITS CREATION. RECENT OBSERVATIONS ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT IS NOT ZERO AND THAT THE NET MASS ENERGY CONTENT OF THE UNIVERSE IS DOMINATED BY A DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CHARACTERIZED SCIENTIFICALLY. THEY DIFFER IN THEIR GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS. DARK MATTER GRAVITATES AS ORDINARY MATTER DOES AND THUS SLOWS THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE BY CONTRAST DARK ENERGY SERVES TO ACCELERATE THE UNIVERSE S EXPANSION.
SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THERE IS MORE THAN ONE UNIVERSE. THEY THINK THAT THERE IS A SET OF UNIVERSES CALLED THE MULTIVERSE. BY DEFINITION THERE IS NO WAY FOR ANYTHING IN ONE UNIVERSE TO AFFECT SOMETHING IN ANOTHER.
THE MULTIVERSE IS NOT YET A SCIENTIFIC IDEA BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY TO TEST IT. AN IDEA THAT CANNOT BE TESTED IS NOT SCIENCE.
VIKINGS
BOB IS BORN TO PROUD FARTHER JIM BOB AND MOTHER JIM BOBILINA IN BOB TOWN
THE VIKINGS WERE PEOPLE FROM SCANDINAVIA DENMARK NORWAY AND SWEDEN FROM ABOUT 700 AD TO ABOUT 1100. THIS PERIOD IS CALLED THE VIKING AGE. VIKINGS TRAVELED GREAT DISTANCES IN THEIR LONG SHIPS AS TRADERS SETTLERS AND WARRIORS. MANY OF THE VIKINGS WERE TALL AND HAD RED OR BLONDE HAIR AND BEARDS. VILLAGES ON OR NEAR ANY COAST IN EARLY MEDIEVAL EUROPE LIVED IN GREAT FEAR OF VIKING ATTACKS. SOME OF THE COUNTRIES MOST AFFECTED BY VIKING RAIDS WERE BRITAIN GERMANY FRANCE SPAIN AND ITALY. THE WORD VIKING SEEMS TO HAVE TWO USES. THE WORD VIKING TAKEN FROM RUNE STONES MEANING A MAN WHO HAS GONE WITH OTHER MEN ON A MILITARY JOURNEY. VIKING IS A WORD FOR THE JOURNEY ITSELF. THE WORD DID NOT SEEM TO INCLUDE THOSE WHO WENT ON PEACEFUL TRADING JOURNEYS. VIKINGS WERE FIERCE WARRIORS WHO TOOK OVER THE WORLD.
THE PEOPLE OF THE FAR NORTH LATER CALLED VIKINGS WERE FIRST NOTICED BY THE ROMANS AROUND THE YEAR 100 BC. THIS IS WHEN THE CIMBRI AND THE TEUTONS MOVED INTO SOUTHERN GAUL. THE ROMANS BELIEVED THESE WAR LIKE TRIBES CAME FROM JUTLAND. BUT THE ROMANS SUSPECTED THEY WERE ONLY A PART OF A GREATER THREAT LOCATED FURTHER NORTH. THE ROMAN HISTORIANS JORDANES DESCRIBED THE DESTRUCTIVE OSTROGOTHS AND VISIGOTHS AS HAVING COME FROM GOTLAND. THE NORTHERN MENACE SURVIVED THE FALL OF THE WESTERN ROMAN EMPIRE. 
THE FRANKISH EMPIRE THAT SUCCEEDED THEM IN GAUL BECAME MORE AND MORE AWARE OF THE NORTHERN THREAT. AS THE LATER CAROLINGIAN EMPIRE EXPANDED INTO NORTHERN GERMANY THEY CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE DANISH PEOPLE. THIS IS WHEN THE VIKINGS FIRST ENTERED INTO WRITTEN HISTORY. THE FIRST RECORDED RAID IN THE WEST WAS AT LINDISFARNE IN 793. WHY THE VIKINGS SUDDENLY BEGAN RAIDING IS NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR. BUT A POPULAR THEORY IS THE POPULATIONS HAD GROWN TO THE POINT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED EVERYONE. THE EARLIEST RAIDERS DID NOT SEEM TO WANT TO MOVE OUT OF SCANDINAVIA. THEY TURNED TO LOOTING THEN RETURNING HOME. THESE HIT AND RUN RAIDS WERE MADE POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE VIKINGS WERE MASTER BOAT BUILDERS AND THEY CREATED FLAT BOTTOMED BOATS IDEAL FOR JOURNEYS UP RIVERS WHERE MANY MONASTIC SITES LAY READY FOR PLUNDERING. THIS SEEMS TO INDICATE THERE WAS SPACE ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE. BECAUSE THEY FOUND RAIDING SO EASY IT BECAME MORE AND MORE POPULAR AMONG THE VIKINGS.
THREE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF VIKINGS CAN BE IDENTIFIED. THEY TOOK THREE DIFFERENT SOMETIMES OVERLAPPING ROUTES.
EUROPEANS WERE SCARED OF THE VIKINGS BECAUSE OF THEIR STRONG WEAPONS SWIFT ATTACKS AND CRUEL FIGHTING TACTICS. THEY WERE KNOWN FOR THEIR BAD TREATMENT OF WOMEN CHILDREN AND MONKS IN THE PLACES WHERE THEY FOUGHT. WHEN THE VIKINGS CAME TO ENGLAND THE ENGLISH KINGS PAID THEM TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT THE VIKINGS TOOK THEIR MONEY AND SOMETIMES FOUGHT THEM ANYWAY. THESE PAYMENTS WERE CALLED DANEGELD. FROM THE 9TH CENTURY TO 1066 WHEN THE FRENCH DUKE OF NORMANDY WHO BECAME KING WILLIAM I OF ENGLAND CONQUERED IT DANISH AND NORWEGIAN VIKINGS RULED LARGE PARTS OF ENGLAND.
BECAUSE OF THEIR LONGSHIPS WHICH COULD FLOAT IN 4 FEET 1.3M OF WATER THE VIKINGS WERE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR WAY UP RIVERS AND LAND DEEP INSIDE A COUNTRY. FOR EXAMPLE THEY SAILED UP THE RIVER SHANNON IN IRELAND AND BUILT A HARBOUR 60 MILES 100 KM FROM THE COAST.
THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN WHO LED VIKING RAIDS. IN THE 9TH CENTURY VIKING AGE RAIDS WERE LED BY MEN WHO MAY HAVE BEEN EXILES IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES. THE LATER VIKING RAIDS IN THE LATE 10TH CENTURY AND EARLY 11TH CENTURY AND WERE LED BY KINGS. SOME OF THE EARLY LEADERS TRIED TO BECOME KINGS WITH THE RICHES THEY PLUNDERED FROM EUROPE AND RUSSIA. SOME WERE SUCCESSFUL BUT MOST WERE NOT.
THE VIKINGS WERE CALLED RUS BY THE PEOPLES EAST OF THE BALTIC SEA. THE VIKINGS WHO SETTLED IN KIEV AND FORMED THE FIRST RUSSIAN STATE. THE VIKINGS RUS WHO SERVED THE BYZANTINE EMPERORS WERE CALLED VARANGIANS. THEY BECAME THE PERSONAL BODYGUARDS TO THE EMPEROR AND WERE CALLED THE VARANGIAN GUARD.
THE VIKINGS TRAVELED THROUGH RUSSIA THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA SOUTHERN EUROPE NORTHERN AFRICA AND SOUTH WESTERN ASIA. SOME VIKINGS SAILED ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN VIA ICELAND AND GREENLAND AND MAY HAVE EXPLORED PLACES IN NORTH AMERICA. THE RUINS OF A VIKING SETTLEMENT HAVE BEEN FOUND AT L ANSE AUX MEADOWS NEWFOUNDLAND. ARCHAEOLOGISTS USED RADIOCARBON DATING TO FIND OUT HOW OLD THE SETTLEMENT WAS. THEIR TESTS GAVE THEM A RANGE OF DATES FROM ABOUT AD 700 TO ABOUT AD 1000.
SOME ENGLISH WORDS AND MANY PLACE NAMES CAME FROM THE SCANDINAVIAN AND VIKING LANGUAGE NORSE. FOR EXAMPLE THE WORDS SKIRT AND SHIRT CAME FROM THE WORD SKYRTA MEANING A TUNIC. AS ENGLISH CHANGED THE SEMANTICS ALTERED TO GIVE US THE SEPARATE WORDS SKIRT AND SHIRT WE KNOW TODAY. SKIN CAME FROM THE NORSE WORD SKINN WHICH MEANT TO STRIP THE MEAT OFF SOMETHING. SOME PLACE NAMES IN THE AREAS THE VIKINGS CONQUERED ARE STILL IN USE. FOR EXAMPLE IN YORKSHIRE PLACES ENDING WITH THWAITE MEANT A CLEARING AND DALE MEANT A VALLEY. THE WORD THORPE MEANT NEW VILLAGE SUCH AS SCUNTHORPE.
THE ANGLO SAXONS CALLED THE VIKINGS PAGANS. THEY WORSHIPED A GREAT MANY GODS. VIKING GODS BELONGED TO TWO GROUPS OF GODS IN NORSE MYTHOLOGY. THEY EITHER BELONGED TO THE AESIR OR THE VANIR. THE AESIR WERE GODS OF WAR. AESIR MEANS GODS. THEY WERE THE RULERS OF ASGARD. ODIN WAS THE LEADER OF THE AESIR. HE AND THE GODS UNDER HIM RULED MORTAL MEN. THE VANIR WERE WISE GODS SKILLED IN MAGICAL ARTS. THEY LIVE IN VANAHEIM ALTHOUGH NOBODY KNOWS WHERE IT IS. THE VANIR CAN ALSO PREDICT THE FUTURE. THERE WAS A WAR BETWEEN THE AESIR AND THE VANIR. WHEN IT ENDED THE GOD NJORD AND HIS CHILDREN FREYA AND FREYR CAME TO LIVE IN ASGARD.
THE PAGAN VIKINGS WERE EXPOSED TO CHRISTIANITY FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE VIKING AGE. THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY CHRISTIAN COUNTRIES. EARLY CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES WERE EITHER ENSLAVED OR PUT TO DEATH. THE VIKINGS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH CHRISTIANITY WHEN THEY RAIDED OTHER AREAS AROUND THEM. VIKING RAIDS PRODUCED MANY CHRISTIAN SLAVES WHO WERE BROUGHT BACK TO SCANDINAVIA. THEY CALLED CHRISTIANS CROSS MEN BECAUSE OF THE CROSS IN THEIR WORSHIP. IN RESPONSE MANY VIKINGS ADOPTED THORS HAMMER AS THEIR RELIGIOUS SYMBOL. WHEN VIKINGS SETTLED IN CHRISTIAN AREAS THEY CONVERTED TO CHRISTIANITY. THERE ARE STILL HEADSTONES IN ENGLAND WITH BOTH A CROSS AND A HAMMER. PERHAPS THEY THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY. THAT OR THE MORE GODS THE BETTER. AS SOME VIKINGS TURNED FROM RAIDING TO TRADING THEY FOUND A NOMINAL IN NAME ONLY PROFESSION OF CHRISTIANITY TO BE HELPFUL. SCANDINAVIA THEIR HOMELAND WAS SLOWER TO CHANGE TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION. BUT BY THE MID 11TH CENTURY MOST OF NORWAY AND DENMARK HAD CONVERTED. SWEDEN WAS CONVERTED BY THE MID 12TH CENTURY. OVERALL SCANDINAVIA AND THE PEOPLES OF THE BALTIC SEA WERE THE LAST TO ACCEPT CHRISTIANITY. 
THE VIKING S RELIGION AFFECTED CHRISTIANITY AS WELL. THE PAGAN CELEBRATION OF YULETIDE BECAME CHRISTMAS ALONG WITH THE CUSTOM OF THE CHRISTMAS TREE. PRIESTS BLESSING THE FIELDS TOOK THE PLACE OF PAGAN FERTILITY RITES OF SPRING HELD TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS A GOOD HARVEST. NORSE KEPT THEIR FARM GODS WELL AFTER CHRISTIANITY JUST TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE PROTECTED. SANTA CLAUS OWES MUCH OF HIS LEGEND TO THE NORSE GOD ODIN. WITH HIS SNOW WHITE BEARD HE TRAVELED THE MIDWINTER SKY ON HIS EIGHT FOOTED STEED SLEIPNIR VISITING HIS PEOPLE WITH GIFTS. HE BECAME FATHER CHRISTMAS. BLENDED WITH THE CHRISTIAN SAINT NICHOLAS HE THEY BECAME SANTA CLAUS.
VIOLIN
THE VIOLIN IS A STRING INSTRUMENT WHICH HAS FOUR STRINGS AND IS PLAYED WITH A BOW. THE STRINGS ARE USUALLY TUNED TO THE NOTES G D A AND E. IT IS HELD BETWEEN THE LEFT COLLAR BONE NEAR THE SHOULDER AND THE CHIN. DIFFERENT NOTES ARE MADE BY FINGERING PRESSING ON THE STRINGS WITH THE LEFT HAND WHILE BOWING WITH THE RIGHT. IT HAS NO FRETS OR OTHER MARKERS. 
THE VIOLIN IS THE SMALLEST AND HIGHEST PITCHED STRING INSTRUMENT TYPICALLY USED IN WESTERN MUSIC. A PERSON WHO PLAYS THE VIOLIN IS CALLED A VIOLINIST. A PERSON WHO MAKES OR REPAIRS VIOLINS IS CALLED A LUTHIER.
THE VIOLIN IS IMPORTANT IN EUROPEAN AND ARABIAN MUSIC. NO OTHER INSTRUMENT HAS PLAYED SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART IN EUROPE. THE MODERN VIOLIN IS ABOUT 400 YEARS OLD. SIMILAR STRING INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR ALMOST 1000 YEARS. BY THE TIME THE MODERN ORCHESTRAS STARTED TO FORM IN THE 17TH CENTURY THE VIOLIN WAS NEARLY FULLY DEVELOPED. IT BECAME THE MOST IMPORTANT ORCHESTRAL INSTRUMENT. NEARLY EVERY COMPOSER WROTE FOR THE VIOLIN. IT IS USED AS A SOLO INSTRUMENT IN CHAMBER MUSIC IN ORCHESTRAL MUSIC FOLK MUSIC AND IN JAZZ. THE VIOLIN IS THE MOST POPULAR INSTRUMENT FOR CHILDREN.
THE VIOLIN IS SOMETIMES CALLED A FIDDLE. SOMEONE WHO PLAYS IT IS A FIDDLER. THERE IS EVEN A VERB TO FIDDLE WHICH MEANS TO PLAY THE FIDDLE. THIS WORD CAN BE USED AS A NICKNAME FOR THE VIOLIN. IT IS PROPERLY USED WHEN TALKING ABOUT FOLK MUSIC.
THE WORD VIOLIN IS RELATED TO THE WORD VIOL. THE VIOLIN WAS NOT MADE DIRECTLY FROM THE INSTRUMENTS CALLED VIOLS. THE WORD VIOLIN COMES FROM THE MIDDLE LATIN WORD VITULA. IT MEANS STRINGED INSTRUMENT. THIS WORD IS ALSO BELIEVED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE GERMANIC FIDDLE. THE MODERN EUROPEAN VIOLIN CHANGED OVER TIME FROM MANY DIFFERENT BOWED STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. THEY WERE BROUGHT FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE. MOST LIKELY THE FIRST MAKERS OF VIOLINS TOOK IDEAS FROM THREE KINDS OF CURRENT INSTRUMENTS. THEY ARE THE REBEC IN USE SINCE THE 10TH CENTURY THE RENAISSANCE FIDDLE AND THE LIRA DA BRACCIO. THESE INSTRUMENTS WERE HELD UNDER THE CHIN AND BOWED.
IN THE 17TH CENTURY THERE WERE SEVERAL FAMILIES OF LUTHIERS WHO WERE VERY GOOD AT MAKING INSTRUMENTS. THE MOST FAMOUS VIOLIN MAKERS WERE STRADIVARIUS AMATI AND GUARNERI. SOME OF THE INSTRUMENTS THAT THESE LUTHIERS MADE ARE STILL HERE TODAY. THEY ARE KEPT IN MUSEUMS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THEY ARE SOME OF THE BEST INSTRUMENTS IN EXISTENCE. THEY CAN HAVE PRICES OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS.
THE BIGGEST PART OF THE VIOLIN IS THE WOODEN BODY. THIS ACTS AS A RESONATING BOX. IT MAKES THE VIBRATING STRINGS SOUND LOUDER. MANY OF THE PARTS OF THE VIOLIN ARE NAMED AFTER PARTS OF THE BODY. THE FRONT IS CALLED THE BELLY. THE BACK IS CALLED THE BACK. THE SIDES ARE THE RIBS. THE STRINGS GO FROM NEAR THE TOP OF THE NECK DOWN THE FINGERBOARD AND ON TO THE TAIL PIECE. THE STRINGS GO ACROSS THE BRIDGE HALFWAY BETWEEN THE END OF THE FINGERBOARD AND THE TAILPIECE. THE BRIDGE IS NOT FIXED ONTO THE VIOLIN. IT IS HELD IN PLACE BY THE STRINGS. THE STRINGS KEEP IT IN PLACE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO TIGHT. IF THE STRINGS ARE COMPLETELY LOOSENED THE BRIDGE WILL NOT STAY ON. THE BRIDGE HELPS TO SEND THE VIBRATIONS OF THE STRINGS DOWN TO THE BODY OF THE INSTRUMENT. INSIDE THE BODY THERE IS A SOUNDPOST. THIS IS A SMALL PIECE OF WOOD. IT LOOKS LIKE A SMALL FINGER. IT GOES FROM THE BELLY TO THE BACK. THE SOUNDPOST IS ALSO HELD IN PLACE BY THE STRINGS. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BELLY THERE ARE TWO LONG CURVED HOLES. THEY ARE CALLED F HOLES. THIS IS BECAUSE OF THEIR SHAPE. THE TOP OF THE STRINGS ARE WOUND AROUND PEGS. THE VIOLIN CAN BE TUNED BY TURNING THE PEGS. THE VERY TOP OF THE NECK IS CALLED THE SCROLL. VIOLINS TODAY ALSO HAVE A CHINREST. THIS HELPS TO HOLD THE VIOLIN AGAINST THE PLAYER S SHOULDER. A SHOULDER REST CAN ALSO BE USED. THESE ARE NOW MADE OF FOAM. THEY HAVE SPECIAL LEGS TO HOLD THEM ON TO THE VIOLIN. MANY BEGINNERS PREFER TO USE A SPONGE AND AN ELASTIC BAND INSTEAD.
TO MAKE IT EASIER TO TUNE THE VIOLIN MANY PEOPLE FIND IT HELPFUL TO HAVE ADJUSTERS FOR FINE TUNING WHEN THE STRING IS ONLY SLIGHTLY OUT OF TUNE. THESE ADJUSTERS GO THROUGH HOLES IN THE TAILPIECE. THEY STOP THE STRINGS FROM SLIPPING WHEN BEING TUNED.
STRINGS USED TO BE MADE OF GUT. THEY ARE NOW MOSTLY MADE OF STEEL OR NYLON. ADJUSTERS CAN ONLY BE USED WITH SOME STRINGS. THE FRONT OF THE VIOLIN BODY IS MADE OF SPRUCE. THE BACK AND SIDES OF THE BODY ARE MADE OF MAPLE. THE BOW CAN BE MADE OF SEVERAL KINDS OF WOOD. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE PERNAMBUCO. SOME PLAYERS TODAY USE BOWS MADE OF CARBON FIBRE. THE BOW IS STRUNG WITH HORSEHAIR HORSEHAIR IS HAIR THAT COMES FROM THE BACK OF THE HORSE S HEAD ALSO KNOWN AS THE MANE OR FROM THE HORSE S TAIL.
IT TAKES YEARS OF PRACTICE TO BECOME A GOOD VIOLINIST. A BEGINNER WILL START WITH PIECES AND OR EXERCISES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE PRECISE OR COMPLICATED TECHNIQUE IN RIGHT OR LEFT HAND. SOME EXAMPLES OF PIECES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE GREAT TECHNIQUE ARE TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR BY MOZART CHILDREN S SONG A GERMAN FOLK TUNE AND OVER THE RAINBOW. DURING THESE SIMPLE SONGS THE VIOLINIST WILL DEVELOP FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS NECESSARY FOR ALL OTHER TECHNIQUES SUCH AS PROPER BOW AND VIOLIN HOLDING. AS THE MUSICIAN DEVELOPS MORE AND MORE CONFIDENCE AND SKILL IN BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT HAND PIECES AND EXERCISES WILL BECOME PROGRESSIVELY MORE DIFFICULT. WHEN NECESSARY THEY WILL ALSO LEARN TECHNIQUES AND SKILLS THAT WILL ENHANCE THEIR PLAYING. VIBRATO SMOOTH BOW CHANGES IN THE RIGHT HAND AND SHIFTING.
THE VIOLINIST HAS TO LEARN TO PUT THE FINGERS IN EXACTLY THE RIGHT PLACE SO THAT THE MUSIC IS IN TUNE. THIS IS CALLED INTONATION. THE MUSICIAN WILL ALSO LEARN VIBRATO. THIS CHANGES THE INTONATION OF EACH NOTE SLIGHTLY BY MAKING IT A LITTLE BIT SHARPER HIGHER THEN A LITTLE BIT FLATTER LOWER PRODUCING A KIND OF WOBBLE. THIS IS IMPORTANT IN MANY STYLES OF MUSIC TO CREATE MOOD.
BESIDES PLUCKING PIZZICATO THERE ARE MANY SPECIAL EFFECTS. SOME OF THEM ARE GLISSANDO PORTAMENTO AND HARMONICS. THERE IS ALSO DOUBLE STOPPING CHORDS AND SCORDATURA TUNING.
THE VIOLIN CAN BE PLAYED EITHER STANDING OR SITTING DOWN. WHEN PLAYING SOLO MUSIC THE VIOLINIST NORMALLY STANDS. WHEN PLAYING IN CHAMBER MUSIC OR IN ORCHESTRAS THE VIOLINIST SITS BUT THIS WAS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE. WHEN SITTING THE VIOLINIST MAY HAVE TO TURN HIS OR HER RIGHT LEG IN SO THAT IT DOES NOT GET IN THE WAY OF THE BOW.
IN THE 17TH AND 18TH CENTURIES COMPOSERS WROTE A LOT OF MUSIC FOR SOLO VIOLIN. MANY OF THESE COMPOSERS WERE FROM ITALY. THEY WERE THEMSELVES VIOLINISTS. SOME OF THESE VIOLINISTS ARE CORELLI VITALI VIVALDI VERACINI GEMINIANI LOCATELLI AND TARTINI.
IN GERMANY SCHMELZER AND BIBER WROTE SOME VERY VIRTUOSO VIOLIN MUSIC. LATER IN THE EARLY 18TH CENTURY BACH AND HANDEL WROTE MANY MASTERPIECES FOR THE VIOLIN.
IN THE CLASSICAL MUSIC PERIOD THE GREAT COMPOSERS HAYDN MOZART AND BEETHOVEN ALL WROTE SOLO WORKS FOR THE VIOLIN. THEY ALSO WROTE A LARGE AMOUNT OF CHAMBER MUSIC ESPECIALLY STRING QUARTETS.
IN THE ROMANTIC PERIOD MANY VIRTUOSO VIOLIN WORKS WERE WRITTEN. THESE INCLUDE CONCERTOS BY MENDELSSOHN SAINT SA NS BRAHMS BRUCH WIENIAWSKI TCHAIKOVSKY AND DVO K. IN THE 20TH CENTURY MANY VIRTUOSO WORKS WERE WRITTEN. THESE INCLUDE ELGAR SIBELIUS SZYMANOWSKI BART K STRAVINSKY BERG PROKOFIEV SHOSTAKOVICH HINDEMITH AND PENDERECKI. IN THE 19TH CENTURY NICCOL PAGANINI WAS THE MOST FAMOUS VIOLINIST. HE COMPOSED AND PLAYED VIOLIN MUSIC THAT WAS HARDER THAN ANYTHING THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE. PEOPLE COMPARED HIM TO THE DEVIL BECAUSE HE COULD PLAY SO BRILLIANTLY AND BECAUSE HE LOOKED THIN AND MOVED HIS BODY ABOUT IN STRANGE WAYS.
IN RECENT YEARS THE VIOLIN HAS ALSO BEEN USED IN JAZZ PLAYING. ST PHANE GRAPPELLI WAS ESPECIALLY FAMOUS FOR THIS.
SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS VIOLINISTS OF THE LAST CENTURY ARE FRITZ KREISLER JASCHA HEIFETZ DAVID OISTRAKH YEHUDI MENUHIN IDA HAENDEL AND ISAAC STERN. TODAY SOME OF THE GREATEST PLAYERS INCLUDE ITZHAK PERLMAN MAXIM VENGEROV VADIM REPIN NIGEL KENNEDY HILARY HAHN JOSHUA BELL AND FIDDLER SARA WATKINS.
VIRUS
A VIRUS IS A MICROSCOPIC PARASITE WHICH CAN INFECT LIVING ORGANISMS AND CAUSE DISEASE. IT CAN MAKE COPIES OF ITSELF INSIDE ANOTHER ORGANISMS CELLS. VIRUSES CONSIST OF NUCLEIC ACID A PROTEIN COAT. USUALLY THE NUCLEIC ACID IS RNA SOMETIMES IT IS DNA. 
VIRUSES REPRODUCE BY GETTING THEIR NUCLEIC ACID STRAND INTO A PROKARYOTE OR EUKARYOTE CELL. THE RNA OR DNA STRAND THEN TAKES OVER THE CELL MACHINERY TO REPRODUCE COPIES OF ITSELF AND THE PROTEIN COAT. THE CELL THEN BURSTS OPEN SPREADING THE NEWLY CREATED VIRUSES. ALL VIRUSES REPRODUCE THIS WAY AND THERE ARE NO FREE LIVING VIRUSES. VIRUSES ARE UBIQUITOUS EVERYWHERE IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND ALL ORGANISMS CAN BE INFECTED BY THEM.
VIRUSES ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN BACTERIA. THEY WERE NOT VISIBLE UNTIL THE INVENTION OF THE ELECTRON MICROSCOPE. A VIRUS HAS A SIMPLE STRUCTURE. IT HAS NO INTERNAL CELLULAR STRUCTURE NO CELL WALL OR CELL MEMBRANE JUST THE PROTEIN COAT THAT HOLDS THE STRING OF NUCLEIC ACID. 
WITH EUKARYOTE CELLS THE VIRUS PROTEIN COAT IS ABLE TO ENTER THE TARGET CELLS VIA CERTAIN CELL MEMBRANE RECEPTORS. WITH PROKARYOTE BACTERIA CELLS THE BACTERIOPHAGE PHYSICALLY INJECTS THE NUCLEIC ACID STRAND INTO THE HOST CELL.
VIRUSES HAVE THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS 
WHEN THE HOST CELL HAS FINISHED MAKING MORE VIRUSES IT UNDERGOES LYSIS OR BREAKS APART. THE VIRUSES ARE RELEASED AND ARE THEN ABLE TO INFECT OTHER CELLS. VIRUSES CAN REMAIN INTACT FOR A LONG TIME AND WILL INFECT CELLS WHEN THE TIME AND CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT.
SOME SPECIAL VIRUSES ARE WORTH NOTING. BACTERIOPHAGES HAVE EVOLVED TO ENTER BACTERIAL CELLS WHICH HAVE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF CELL WALL FROM EUKARYOTE CELL MEMBRANES. ENVELOPE VIRUSES WHEN THEY REPRODUCE COVER THEMSELVES WITH A MODIFIED FORM OF THE HOST CELL MEMBRANE THUS GAINING AN OUTER LIPID LAYER THAT HELPS ENTRY. SOME OF OUR MOST DIFFICULT TO COMBAT VIRUSES LIKE INFLUENZA AND HIV USE THIS METHOD.
VIRAL INFECTIONS IN ANIMALS TRIGGER AN IMMUNE RESPONSE WHICH USUALLY KILLS THE INFECTING VIRUS. VACCINES CAN ALSO PRODUCE IMMUNE RESPONSES. THEY GIVE AN ARTIFICIALLY ACQUIRED IMMUNITY TO THE SPECIFIC VIRAL INFECTION. HOWEVER SOME VIRUSES INCLUDING THOSE CAUSING AIDS AND VIRAL HEPATITIS ESCAPE FROM THESE IMMUNE RESPONSES AND CAUSE CHRONIC INFECTIONS. ANTIBIOTICS HAVE NO EFFECT ON VIRUSES BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHER DRUGS AGAINST VIRUSES.
THERE ARE A MANY GENOMIC STRUCTURES IN VIRUSES. AS A GROUP THEY HAVE MORE STRUCTURAL GENOMIC DIVERSITY THAN PLANTS ANIMALS ARCHAEA OR BACTERIA. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF VIRUSES BUT ONLY ABOUT 5 000 OF THEM HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED IN DETAIL.
A VIRUS HAS EITHER RNA OR DNA GENES AND IS CALLED AN RNA VIRUS OR A DNA VIRUS RESPECTIVELY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF VIRUSES HAVE RNA GENOMES. PLANT VIRUSES TEND TO HAVE SINGLE STRANDED RNA GENOMES AND BACTERIOPHAGES TEND TO HAVE DOUBLE STRANDED DNA GENOMES.
VIRAL POPULATIONS DO NOT GROW THROUGH CELL DIVISION BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE CELLS. INSTEAD THEY USE THE MACHINERY AND METABOLISM OF A HOST CELL TO PRODUCE MANY COPIES OF THEMSELVES AND THEY ASSEMBLE PUT TOGETHER IN THE CELL.
THE LIFE CYCLE OF VIRUSES DIFFERS GREATLY BETWEEN SPECIES BUT THERE ARE SIX BASIC STAGES IN THE LIFE CYCLE OF VIRUSES 
THE GENETIC MATERIAL WITHIN VIRUS PARTICLES AND THE METHOD BY WHICH THE MATERIAL IS REPLICATED VARIES CONSIDERABLY BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF VIRUSES.
THE BODY S FIRST LINE OF DEFENCE AGAINST VIRUSES IS THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM. THIS HAS CELLS AND OTHER MECHANISMS WHICH DEFEND THE HOST FROM ANY INFECTION. THE CELLS OF THE INNATE SYSTEM RECOGNISE AND RESPOND TO PATHOGENS IN A GENERAL WAY.
RNA INTERFERENCE IS AN IMPORTANT INNATE DEFENCE AGAINST VIRUSES. MANY VIRUSES HAVE A REPLICATION STRATEGY THAT INVOLVES DOUBLE STRANDED RNA DSRNA. WHEN SUCH A VIRUS INFECTS A CELL IT RELEASES ITS RNA MOLECULE. A PROTEIN COMPLEX CALLED DICER STICKS TO IT AND CHOPS THE RNA INTO PIECES. THEN A BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAY CALLED THE RISC COMPLEX STARTS UP. THIS ATTACKS THE VIRAL MRNA AND THE CELL SURVIVES THE INFECTION. 
ROTAVIRUSES AVOID THIS BY NOT UNCOATING FULLY INSIDE THE CELL AND BY RELEASING NEWLY PRODUCED MRNA THROUGH PORES IN THE PARTICLE S INNER CAPSID. THE GENOMIC DSRNA REMAINS PROTECTED INSIDE THE CORE OF THE VIRION.
THE PRODUCTION OF INTERFERON IS AN IMPORTANT HOST DEFENCE MECHANISM. THIS IS A HORMONE PRODUCED BY THE BODY WHEN VIRUSES ARE PRESENT. ITS ROLE IN IMMUNITY IS COMPLEX IT EVENTUALLY STOPS THE VIRUSES FROM REPRODUCING BY KILLING THE INFECTED CELL AND ITS CLOSE NEIGHBOURS.
VERTEBRATES HAVE A SECOND MORE SPECIFIC IMMUNE SYSTEM. IT IS CALLED THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM. WHEN IT MEETS A VIRUS IT PRODUCES SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES THAT BIND TO THE VIRUS AND RENDER IT NON INFECTIOUS. TWO TYPES OF ANTIBODIES ARE IMPORTANT. 
THE FIRST CALLED IGM IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT NEUTRALIZING VIRUSES BUT IS PRODUCED BY THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ONLY FOR A FEW WEEKS. THE SECOND CALLED IGG IS PRODUCED INDEFINITELY. THE PRESENCE OF IGM IN THE BLOOD OF THE HOST IS USED TO TEST FOR ACUTE INFECTION WHEREAS IGG INDICATES AN INFECTION SOMETIME IN THE PAST. IGG ANTIBODY IS MEASURED WHEN TESTS FOR IMMUNITY ARE CARRIED OUT.
ANOTHER VERTEBRATE DEFENCE AGAINST VIRUSES IS CELL MEDIATED IMMUNITY. IT INVOLVES IMMUNE CELLS KNOWN AS T CELLS. THE BODY S CELLS CONSTANTLY DISPLAY SHORT FRAGMENTS OF THEIR PROTEINS ON THE CELL S SURFACE AND IF A T CELL RECOGNISES A SUSPICIOUS VIRAL FRAGMENT THERE THE HOST CELL IS DESTROYED BY KILLER T CELLS AND THE VIRUS SPECIFIC T CELLS PROLIFERATE. CELLS SUCH AS MACROPHAGES ARE SPECIALISTS AT THIS ANTIGEN PRESENTATION. 
NOT ALL VIRUS INFECTIONS PRODUCE A PROTECTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE. THESE PERSISTENT VIRUSES EVADE IMMUNE CONTROL BY SEQUESTRATION HIDING AWAY BLOCKING ANTIGEN PRESENTATION CYTOKINE RESISTANCE EVADING NATURAL KILLER CELL ACTIVITY ESCAPE FROM APOPTOSIS CELL DEATH AND ANTIGENIC SHIFT CHANGING SURFACE PROTEINS. HIV EVADES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM BY CONSTANTLY CHANGING THE AMINO ACID SEQUENCE OF THE PROTEINS ON THE SURFACE OF THE VIRION. OTHER VIRUSES CALLED NEUROTROPIC VIRUSES MOVE ALONG NERVES TO PLACES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM CANNOT REACH.
VIRUSES DO NOT BELONG TO ANY OF THE SIX KINGDOMS. THEY DO NOT MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR BEING CLASSIFIED AS A LIVING ORGANISM BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ACTIVE UNTIL THE POINT OF INFECTION. HOWEVER THAT IS JUST A VERBAL POINT. 
OBVIOUSLY THEIR STRUCTURE AND MODE OF OPERATION MEANS THEY HAVE EVOLVED FROM OTHER LIVING THINGS AND THE LOSS OF NORMAL STRUCTURE OCCURS IN MANY ENDOPARASITES. THE ORIGINS OF VIRUSES IN THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF LIFE ARE UNCLEAR SOME MAY HAVE EVOLVED FROM PLASMIDS PIECES OF DNA THAT CAN MOVE BETWEEN CELLS WHILE OTHERS MAY HAVE EVOLVED FROM BACTERIA. IN EVOLUTION VIRUSES ARE AN IMPORTANT MEANS OF HORIZONTAL GENE TRANSFER WHICH INCREASES GENETIC DIVERSITY.
A RECENT PROJECT DISCOVERED NEARLY 1500 NEW RNA VIRUSES BY SAMPLING OVER 200 INVERTEBRATE SPECIES. THE RESEARCH TEAM... EXTRACTED THEIR RNA AND USING NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING DECIPHERED THE SEQUENCE OF A STAGGERING 6 TRILLION LETTERS PRESENT IN THE INVERTEBRATE RNA LIBRARIES. THE RESEARCH SHOWED THAT VIRUSES CHANGED BITS AND PIECES OF THEIR RNA BY A VARIETY OF GENETIC MECHANISMS. THE INVERTEBRATE VIROME SHOWS REMARKABLE GENOMIC FLEXIBILITY THAT INCLUDES FREQUENT RECOMBINATION LATERAL GENE TRANSFER AMONG VIRUSES AND HOSTS GENE GAIN AND LOSS AND COMPLEX GENOMIC REARRANGEMENTS.
A GROUP OF LARGE VIRUSES INFECT AMOEBAE. THE LARGEST IS PITHOVIRUS. OTHERS IN ORDER OF SIZE ARE PANDORAVIRUS THEN MEGAVIRUS THEN MIMIVIRUS. THEY ARE BIGGER THAN SOME BACTERIA AND VISIBLE UNDER A LIGHT MICROSCOPE.
VIRUSES ARE USED WIDELY IN CELL BIOLOGY. GENETICISTS OFTEN USE VIRUSES AS VECTORS TO INTRODUCE GENES INTO CELLS THAT THEY ARE STUDYING. THIS IS USEFUL FOR MAKING THE CELL PRODUCE A FOREIGN SUBSTANCE OR TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF INTRODUCING A NEW GENE INTO THE GENOME. EASTERN EUROPEAN SCIENTISTS HAVE USED PHAGE THERAPY AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ANTIBIOTICS FOR SOME TIME AND INTEREST IN THIS APPROACH IS INCREASING BECAUSE OF THE HIGH LEVEL OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE NOW FOUND IN SOME PATHOGENIC BACTERIA.
VOLCANO
A VOLCANO IS A MOUNTAIN WITH A HOLE WHERE LAVA HOT LIQUID ROCK COMES FROM A MAGMA CHAMBER UNDER THE GROUND. 
MOST VOLCANOES HAVE A VOLCANIC CRATER AT THE TOP. WHEN A VOLCANO IS ACTIVE MATERIALS COME OUT OF IT. THE MATERIALS INCLUDE LAVA STEAM GASEOUS SULFUR COMPOUNDS ASH AND BROKEN ROCK PIECES. 
WHEN THERE IS ENOUGH PRESSURE THE VOLCANO ERUPTS. SOME VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS BLOW OFF THE TOP OF THE VOLCANO. THE MAGMA COMES OUT SOMETIMES QUICKLY AND SOMETIMES SLOWLY. SOME ERUPTIONS COME OUT AT A SIDE INSTEAD OF THE TOP. 
VOLCANOES ARE FOUND ON PLANETS OTHER THAN EARTH. AN EXAMPLE IS OLYMPUS MONS ON MARS. 
VOLCANOLOGISTS ARE SCIENTISTS WHO STUDY VOLCANOES USING METHODS FROM GEOLOGY CHEMISTRY GEOGRAPHY MINERALOGY PHYSICS AND SOCIOLOGY.
THE LAVA AND PYROCLASTIC MATERIAL CLOUDS OF ASH LAVA FRAGMENTS AND VAPOR THAT COMES OUT FROM VOLCANOES CAN MAKE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF LAND SHAPES. THERE ARE TWO BASIC KINDS OF VOLCANOES. 
THESE VOLCANOES ARE FORMED BY FLUID LOW SILICA MAFIC LAVA. 
SHIELD VOLCANOES ARE BUILT OUT OF LAYERS OF LAVA FROM CONTINUAL ERUPTIONS WITHOUT EXPLOSIONS. BECAUSE THE LAVA IS SO FLUID IT SPREADS OUT OFTEN OVER A WIDE AREA. SHIELD VOLCANOES DO NOT GROW TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND THE LAYERS OF LAVA SPREAD OUT TO GIVE THE VOLCANO GENTLY SLOPING SIDES. SHIELD VOLCANOES CAN PRODUCE HUGE AREAS OF BASALT WHICH IS USUALLY WHAT LAVA IS WHEN COOLED.
THE BASE OF THE VOLCANO INCREASES IN SIZE OVER SUCCESSIVE ERUPTIONS WHERE SOLIDIFIED LAVA SPREADS OUT AND ACCUMULATES. SOME OF THE WORLD S LARGEST VOLCANOES ARE SHIELD VOLCANOES.
EVEN THOUGH THEIR SIDES ARE NOT VERY STEEP SHIELD VOLCANOES CAN BE HUGE. MAUNA KEA IN HAWAII IS THE BIGGEST MOUNTAIN ON EARTH IF IT IS MEASURED FROM ITS BASE ON THE FLOOR OF THE SEA.
A STRATOVOLCANO ALSO KNOWN AS A COMPOSITE VOLCANO IS A TALL CONICAL VOLCANO. IT IS BUILT UP OF MANY LAYERS OF HARDENED LAVA TEPHRA PUMICE AND VOLCANIC ASH. 
UNLIKE SHIELD VOLCANOES STRATOVOLCANOES HAVE A STEEP PROFILE AND PERIODIC ERUPTIONS. THE LAVA THAT FLOWS FROM STRATOVOLCANOES COOLS AND HARDENS BEFORE SPREADING FAR. IT IS STICKY THAT IS IT HAS HIGH VISCOSITY. THE MAGMA FORMING THIS LAVA IS OFTEN FELSIC WITH HIGH TO INTERMEDIATE LEVELS OF SILICA AND LESS MAFIC MAGMA. BIG FELSIC LAVA FLOWS ARE UNCOMMON BUT HAVE TRAVELLED AS FAR AS.
TWO FAMOUS STRATOVOLCANOES ARE JAPAN S MOUNT FUJI AND VESUVIUS. BOTH HAVE BIG BASES AND STEEP SIDES THAT GET STEEPER AND STEEPER AS IT GOES NEAR THE TOP. VESUVIUS IS FAMOUS FOR ITS DESTRUCTION OF THE TOWNS POMPEII AND HERCULANEUM IN 79 AD KILLING THOUSANDS.
A CALDERA IS A BASIN LIKE FEATURE FORMED BY COLLAPSE OF LAND AFTER A VOLCANIC ERUPTION. THIS HAPPENS AFTER A HUGE STRATOVOLCANO BLOWS ITS TOP OFF. THE BASE OF THE CRATER THEN SINKS LEAVING A CALDERA WHERE THE TOP OF THE VOLCANO WAS BEFORE. KRAKATOA BEST KNOWN FOR ITS CATASTROPHIC ERUPTION IN 1883 IS MUCH SMALLER NOW.
THERE ARE TWO MAIN PROCESSES.
VOLCANOES ARE MADE WHEN TWO TECTONIC PLATES COME TOGETHER. WHEN THESE TWO PLATES MEET ONE OF THEM USUALLY THE OCEANIC PLATE GOES UNDER THE CONTINENTAL PLATE. THIS IS THE PROCESS OF SUBDUCTION. AFTERWARDS IT MELTS AND MAKES MAGMA INSIDE THE MAGMA CHAMBER AND THE PRESSURE BUILDS UP UNTIL THE MAGMA BURSTS THROUGH THE EARTH S CRUST. 
THE SECOND WAY IS WHEN A TECTONIC PLATE MOVES OVER A HOT SPOT IN THE EARTH S CRUST. THE HOT SPOT WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH THE CRUST UNTIL IT BREAKS THROUGH. THE CALDERA OF YELLOWSTONE PARK WAS FORMED IN THAT WAY SO WERE THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.
A TRADITIONAL WAY TO CLASSIFY OR IDENTIFY VOLCANOES IS BY ITS PATTERN OF ERUPTIONS. THOSE VOLCANOES WHICH MAY ERUPT AGAIN AT ANY TIME ARE CALLED ACTIVE. THOSE THAT ARE NOW QUIET CALLED DORMANT INACTIVE. THOSE VOLCANOES WHICH HAVE NOT ERUPTED IN HISTORICAL TIMES ARE CALLED EXTINCT.
AN ACTIVE VOLCANO IS CURRENTLY ERUPTING OR IT HAS ERUPTED IN THE LAST 10 000 YEARS. AN EXAMPLE OF AN ACTIVE VOLCANO IS MOUNT ST. HELENS IN THE UNITED STATES US.
A DORMANT VOLCANO IS SLEEPING BUT IT COULD AWAKEN IN THE FUTURE. MOUNT RAINIER IN THE UNITED STATES IS CONSIDERED DORMANT.
AN EXTINCT VOLCANO HAS NOT ERUPTED IN THE PAST 10 000 YEARS. EDINBURGH CASTLE IN SCOTLAND IS LOCATED ON TOP OF AN EXTINCT VOLCANO.
THE EARTH S LARGEST VOLCANO HAS BEEN DISCOVERED. IT IS 2KM BELOW THE SEA ON AN UNDERWATER PLATEAU KNOWN AS THE SHATSKY RISE. THIS IS ABOUT 1 600KM EAST OF JAPAN. THE PREVIOUS RECORD HOLDER MAUNA LOA IN HAWAII IS STILL THE LARGEST VOLCANO ON LAND.
THE 310 000 SQ KM 119 000 SQ MI VOLCANO TAMU MASSIF IS COMPARABLE IN SIZE TO MARS VAST OLYMPUS MONS VOLCANO WHICH IS THE LARGEST IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. IT WAS FORMED ABOUT 145 MILLION YEARS AGO WHEN MASSIVE LAVA FLOWS ERUPTED FROM THE CENTRE OF THE VOLCANO TO FORM A BROAD SHIELD LIKE FEATURE. THAT SUGGESTS THE VOLCANO PRODUCED A FLOOD BASALT ERUPTION. 
THE TAMU MASSIF EXTENDS SOME 30 KM 18 MILES INTO THE EARTH S CRUST. THE RESEARCHERS DOUBTED THE SUBMERGED VOLCANO S PEAK EVER ROSE ABOVE SEA LEVEL DURING ITS LIFETIME AND SAY IT IS UNLIKELY TO ERUPT AGAIN.
WAR
WAR IS A SITUATION OR A PERIOD OF FIGHTING BETWEEN COUNTRIES OR GROUPS OF PEOPLE. A WAR GENERALLY INVOLVES THE USE OF WEAPONS A MILITARY ORGANIZATION AND SOLDIERS. WAR IS A SITUATION IN WHICH A NATION ENFORCES ITS RIGHTS BY USING FORCE. NOT EVERY ARMED CONFLICT IS A WAR. A FIGHT BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN GANGS DRUG CARTELS ETC. IS NOT CONSIDERED A WAR. HOWEVER MOST WARS ARE CALLED ARMED CONFLICTS. INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW IS A SET OF RULES THAT TRIES TO LIMIT THE EFFECTS OF WARS. INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW RECOGNIZES TWO KINDS OF WARS. THESE ARE 
KARL VON CLAUSEWITZ WROTE IN HIS CLASSIC BOOK ON WAR THAT WAR IS A MERE CONTINUATION OF POLICY WITH OTHER MEANS. CLAUSEWITZ VIEWED WAR AS A POLITICAL INSTRUMENT. HIS BOOK ABOUT MILITARY PHILOSOPHY REMAINS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL WORK ON THE HISTORY AND STRATEGY OF WAR. AN EARLIER AUTHORITY ON WAR WAS SUN TZU. IN HIS BOOK THE ART OF WAR SUN TZU SAW WAR AS A NECESSARY EVIL. IT WAS SOMETHING PEOPLE DO.
WARS HAVE BEEN FOUGHT TO CONTROL NATURAL RESOURCES FOR RELIGIOUS OR CULTURAL REASONS AND OVER POLITICAL BALANCES OF POWER. THEY HAVE BEEN FOUGHT OVER LEGITIMACY CORRECTNESS OF PARTICULAR LAWS. THEY HAVE BEEN FOUGHT TO SETTLE ARGUMENTS ABOUT LAND OR MONEY AND MANY OTHER ISSUES. THE REASONS BEHIND ANY WAR ARE OFTEN VERY COMPLEX. WHILE A WAR CAN START FOR JUST ABOUT ANY REASON THERE IS USUALLY MORE THAN ONE CAUSE.
FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES INDIVIDUAL STATES OR POLITICAL FACTIONS HAVE USED WAR TO GAIN SOVEREIGNTY OVER REGIONS. IN ONE OF THE EARLIEST CIVILIZATIONS IN HISTORY MESOPOTAMIA THEY WERE IN A NEAR CONSTANT STATE OF WAR. ANCIENT EGYPT DURING ITS EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD CAME ABOUT BY WAR WHEN LOWER AND UPPER EGYPT WERE JOINED TOGETHER AS ONE COUNTRY ABOUT 3100 BC. THE ZHOU DYNASTY RULED ANCIENT CHINA CAME TO POWER IN 1046 THROUGH WAR. SCIPIO AFRICANUS 236 183 BCE DEFEATED CARTHAGE LEADING ANCIENT ROME TO BEGIN A CONQUEST OF THE KNOWN WORLD. PHILIP II OF MACEDON 382 336 BCE UNITED A GROUP OF CITY STATES TO BECOME ANCIENT GREECE.
SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON T SEE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIGHTING BETWEEN COUNTRIES OR PEOPLE AND THE FORMAL DECLARATION OF A STATE OF WAR. THOSE WHO DO SEE THIS DIFFERENCE USUALLY ONLY USE THE WORD WAR FOR THE FIGHTING WHERE THE COUNTRIES GOVERNMENTS HAVE OFFICIALLY DECLARED WAR ON EACH OTHER. SMALLER ARMED CONFLICTS ARE OFTEN CALLED RIOTS REBELLIONS COUPS ETC. 
ONE COUNTRY MAY SEND FORCES TO ANOTHER COUNTRY FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. SOMETIMES IT IS TO HELP KEEP ORDER OR PREVENT KILLINGS OF INNOCENTS OR OTHER CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. IT MAY BE TO PROTECT A FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT AGAINST AN UPRISING. HERE IT MAY BE CALLED A POLICE ACTION OR HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION INSTEAD OF A WAR. SOME PEOPLE THINK IT S STILL A WAR.
ANOTHER KIND OF WAR EXISTED FROM 1947 UNTIL 1991 CALLED THE COLD WAR. THIS STARTED WHEN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION BROKE DOWN. BOTH COUNTRIES HAD NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND BOTH STOOD READY TO USE THEM AGAINST THE OTHER. BUT THERE WAS NO ACTUAL WAR BETWEEN THE TWO. IT ENDED WITH THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION IN 1991. THE COLD WAR WAS ALSO CALLED A CONTAINMENT WHERE THE UNITED STATES TRIED TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COMMUNISM TO OTHER COUNTRIES. DURING THE COLD WAR THE MAJOR POWERS DID NOT FIGHT THEMSELVES BUT OFTEN BACKED THIRD PARTIES IN WHAT WAS CALLED A PROXY WAR. THE VIETNAM WAR IS OFTEN GIVEN AS AN EXAMPLE OF A PROXY WAR. BUT PROXY WARS HAPPENED LONG BEFORE THE COLD WAR AND ARE STILL HAPPENING.
A WAR BETWEEN PEOPLES AND GROUPS IN THE SAME COUNTRY IS KNOWN AS A CIVIL WAR. IT IS GENERALLY AGREED THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT MAKE A WAR A CIVIL WAR. IT MUST BE A STRUGGLE BETWEEN GROUPS IN THE SAME COUNTRY OR STATE OVER POLITICAL CONTROL OR TO FORCE A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE GOVERNMENT S POLICY. THE SECOND CRITERION IS THAT MORE THAN 1000 PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE BEEN KILLED WITH A MINIMUM OF 100 FROM EACH SIDE. THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CIVIL WAR. WHILE THE FIGURES ARE MERE ESTIMATES THE TOTAL CASUALTIES ARE THOUGHT TO BE ABOUT 750 000.
ONLY IN THE LAST 150 YEARS OR SO HAVE STATES AGREED ON INTERNATIONAL LAWS TO LIMIT WARFARE. THIS HAS BEEN MAINLY FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS. THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS AND THE HAGUE CONVENTIONS ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF AGREEMENTS THAT ESTABLISH LAWS GOVERNING WARS. COLLECTIVELY THESE ARE USUALLY CALLED INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW IHL. BECAUSE THESE ARE ESTABLISHED LAWS THEY RESTRICT THOSE ENGAGED IN ARMED CONFLICTS TO FOLLOW THE IHL. ALSO A COUNTRY MUST NOT ONLY RESPECT THE LAW BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE OTHER COUNTRIES RESPECT IT AS WELL. THEY CANNOT TURN A BLIND EYE MEANING PRETEND THEY DO NOT SEE A THING TO COUNTRIES WHO ARE NOT FOLLOWING IHC. THE FIRST OF THESE WAS THE GENEVA CONVENTION IN 1864. IT BECAME INTERNATIONAL LAW WITH THE SIGNATURES OF 10 COUNTRIES.
THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF WAR WAS STARTED BY LEWIS FRY RICHARDSON FOLLOWING WORLD WAR I. MORE RECENT DATABASES OF WARS HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED BY THE CORRELATES OF WAR PROJECT AND PETER BRECKE.
WHEAT
WHEAT SPECIES OF TRITICUM IS A CEREAL GRAIN. PEOPLE EAT IT MOST OFTEN IN THE FORM OF BREAD. IT IS A KIND OF GRASS WHOSE FRUIT IS A HEAD OF WHEAT WITH EDIBLE SEEDS. IT WAS FIRST GROWN IN THE LEVANT A REGION OF THE NEAR EAST. NOW IT IS CULTIVATED WORLDWIDE. 
WORLD TRADE IN WHEAT IS GREATER THAN FOR ALL OTHER CROPS COMBINED. GLOBALLY WHEAT IS THE LEADING SOURCE OF VEGETABLE PROTEIN IN HUMAN FOOD. IT HAS A HIGHER PROTEIN CONTENT THAN OTHER MAJOR CEREALS SUCH AS MAIZE CORN OR RICE. IN TERMS OF TOTAL PRODUCTION IT IS SECOND TO RICE AS THE MAIN HUMAN FOOD CROP AND AHEAD OF MAIZE MAIZE IS USED MORE FOR ANIMAL FEEDS.
WHEAT WAS A KEY FACTOR ENABLING THE EMERGENCE OF CITY BASED SOCIETIES AT THE START OF CIVILIZATION. IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST CROPS THAT COULD BE EASILY CULTIVATED ON A LARGE SCALE AND ITS SEEDS COULD BE STORED FOR LONG PERIODS IN A DRY CLIMATE. WHEAT HELPED THE GROWTH OF CITY STATES IN THE FERTILE CRESCENT INCLUDING THE BABYLONIAN ASSYRIAN AND PERSIAN EMPIRES. 
WHEAT GRAIN IS A STAPLE FOOD USED TO MAKE FLOUR FOR LEAVENED FLAT AND STEAMED BREADS BISCUITS COOKIES CAKES BREAKFAST CEREAL PASTA NOODLES COUSCOUS. IT CAN ALSO BE FERMENTED TO MAKE ETHANOL FOR ALCOHOLIC DRINKS OR BIOFUEL. 
AN ALLERGY TO WHEAT CAN CAUSE COELIAC DISEASE WHICH MAKES THE SUFFERER HAVE DIARRHOEA IF THEY EAT ANY FOOD CONTAINING WHEAT.
THE WHEAT PLANT HAS LONG SLENDER LEAVES STEMS THAT ARE HOLLOW IN MOST TYPES OF WHEAT PLANTS AND HEADS THAT HAVE MANY KINDS OF FLOWERS FROM 20 TO 100. THE FLOWERS ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN SPIKELETS. EACH SPIKELET HAS TWO TO SIX FLOWERS. IN MOST SPIKELETS TWO OR THREE OF THE FLOWERS BECOME FERTILIZED AND THIS MAKES THEM PRODUCE THE GRAINS USED FOR FOOD.
ALL CULTIVATED WHEATS HAVE MORE THAN ONE NORMAL DIPLOID SET OF CHROMOSOMES. THE INCREASES IN CHROMOSOME SETS OCCURS NATURALLY AT A LOW RATE. BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE CHROMOSOMES THEIR EARS OF WHEAT ARE LARGER. ALL MAN DID WAS TO SELECT THE PLANTS WITH EXTRA FAT EARS OF WHEAT WHEN THEY OCCURRED. NOW A WHOLE RANGE OF CULTIVATED WHEATS ARE AVAILABLE. THESE ARE JUST A FEW 
HEXAPLOID SPECIES SIX SETS OF CHROMOSOMES 
TETRAPLOID SPECIES FOUR SETS 
DIPLOID SPECIES NORMAL TWO SETS OF CHROMOSOMES 
EMMER WHEAT TRITICUM DICOCCUM OR HULLED WHEAT IS A TYPE OF AWNED WHEAT. IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST CROPS DOMESTICATED IN THE NEAR EAST. IT WAS WIDELY CULTIVATED IN THE ANCIENT WORLD BUT IS NOW A RELICT CROP IN MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS OF EUROPE AND ASIA.
IN THE WILD THE AWNS OF EMMER WHEAT SPIKELETS HELP THEM DIG INTO THE SOIL. WITH HUMIDITY IN THE NIGHT THE AWNS OF THE SPIKELET BECOME ERECT AND DRAW TOGETHER AND IN THE PROCESS PUSH THE GRAIN INTO THE SOIL. DURING THE DAY THE HUMIDITY DROPS AND THE AWNS SLACKEN BACK AGAIN. DURING THE COURSE OF DAYS AND NIGHTS THE AWNS PUMPING MOVEMENTS DRILL THE SPIKELET AS MUCH AS AN INCH INTO THE SOIL.
EINKORN WHEAT IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST CULTIVATED FORMS OF WHEAT TRITICUM MONOCOCCUM. GRAINS OF WILD EINKORN HAVE BEEN FOUND IN PALEOLITHIC SITES OF THE FERTILE CRESCENT. IT WAS FIRST DOMESTICATED ABOUT 7500 BC 9000 YEARS AGO IN THE EARLY NEOLITHIC PERIOD. EVIDENCE FROM DNA SUGGESTS EINKORN WAS DOMESTICATED IN SOUTHEAST TURKEY WHERE A NUMBER OF EARLY FARMING VILLAGES HAVE BEEN FOUND. ITS CULTIVATION DECREASED IN THE BRONZE AGE AND TODAY IT IS A RELIC CROP THAT IS RARELY PLANTED. IT HAS FOUND A NEW MARKET AS A HEALTH FOOD. IT IS STILL USED FOR BULGUR CRACKED WHEAT OR AS ANIMAL FEED IN MOUNTAINOUS AREAS OF FRANCE MOROCCO FORMER YUGOSLAVIA TURKEY AND OTHER COUNTRIES. IT OFTEN SURVIVES ON POOR SOILS WHERE OTHER SPECIES OF WHEAT FAIL.
EINKORN WAS DOMESTICATED AT THE SAME TIME AS EMMER WHEAT BUT WAS NOT SO IMPORTANT.

QUOTES
BE NOT AFRAID OF GREATNESS SOME ARE BORN GREAT SOME ACHIEVE GREATNESS AND SOME HAVE GREATNESS THRUST UPON THEM. 
TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE AND IT MUST FOLLOW AS THE NIGHT THE DAY THOU CANST NOT THEN BE FALSE TO ANY MAN. 
THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE NEVER DID RUN SMOOTH. 
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 26 APRIL 1564 BAPTIZED 23 APRIL 1616 WAS AN ENGLISH PLAYWRIGHT POET AND ACTOR. HE WROTE 37 PLAYS WITH ABOUT HALF OF THEM CONSIDERED COMEDIES AND TWO LONG POEMS IN HIS LIFETIME. HE LIVED IN STRATFORD UPON AVON IN WARWICKSHIRE ENGLAND. HIS PLAYS ARE STILL PERFORMED TODAY. HE IS OFTEN QUOTED IN MODERN WRITING.
BY 1594 HE WAS AN ACTOR IN THE CHAMBERLAIN S MEN ACTING COMPANY. 
HIS PLAYS ARE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OR GENRES. THERE ARE HISTORIES TRAGEDIES AND COMEDIES. THESE PLAYS ARE AMONG THE BEST KNOWN IN ENGLISH LITERATURE AND ARE STUDIED IN SCHOOLS AROUND THE WORLD. SHAKESPEARE WROTE HIS WORKS BETWEEN ABOUT 1590 AND 1613. HE IS CONSIDERED THE FIRST WRITER WHO WROTE A TRAGICOMEDY. A TRAGICOMEDY IS A PLAY THAT MIXES COMEDY AND TRAGEDY WITH A HAPPY ENDING. 
SHAKESPEARE S PLAYS ARE WRITTEN IN POETIC LANGUAGE. MANY OF THE PLAYS ARE SET IN STRANGE DISTANT PLACES AND TIMES. THEY ARE STILL POPULAR TODAY. THE STORIES ARE OFTEN EXCITING VERY FUNNY IN THE COMEDIES OR VERY SAD IN THE TRAGEDIES AND MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO HIS CHARACTERS. HE SAYS MUCH ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE STILL IMPORTANT TODAY LIKE LOVE SADNESS HOPE PRIDE HATRED JEALOUSY AND FOOLISHNESS. 
SHAKESPEARE ADDED NEW WORDS AND PHRASES TO THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. HE ALSO MADE SOME WORDS MORE POPULAR. HE CREATED OVER 1 700 ENGLISH WORDS.
HE MARRIED ANNE HATHAWAY A WOMAN EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HE WAS. HE HAD THREE CHILDREN SUSANNA MARRIED JOHN HALL HAMNET SHAKESPEARE DIED AT THE AGE OF 11 DUE TO UNKNOWN REASONS AND JUDITH MARRIED THOMAS QUINEY. 3 BY 1592 HE HAD BECOME AN ACTOR AND WAS BECOMING WELL KNOWN AS A WRITER OF PLAYS. AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH IN 1616 ONLY SOME OF HIS PLAYS HAD BEEN PUBLISHED IN SINGLE EDITIONS. THE PLAYS WERE COLLECTED AND PUBLISHED IN 1623 SEVEN YEARS AFTER HE DIED.
THERE IS PROOF THAT PEOPLE IN SHAKESPEARE S TIME THOUGHT HIGHLY OF HIM. AFTER HIS DEATH EVEN HIS RIVAL BEN JONSON SAID 
HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE BUILDING OF THE GLOBE THEATRE IN 1599. IT BURNED DOWN A FEW YEARS LATER. HIS PLAYS ARE PERFORMED AT A NEW GLOBE BUILT NEARBY IN 1997.
ALTHOUGH SHAKESPEARE WAS MARRIED TO A WOMAN AND FATHERED THREE CHILDREN SUSANNA HAMNET AND JUDITH PEOPLE HAVE DEBATED HIS SEXUALITY. SOME PEOPLE SUCH AS PETER HOLLAND OF THE SHAKESPEARE INSTITUTE AT BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY HAVE ARGUED THAT SHAKESPEARE WAS POSSIBLY BISEXUAL BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE SONNETS HE WROTE THAT WERE DIRECTED TOWARDS YOUNG MEN.
ABOUT 150 YEARS AFTER SHAKESPEARE DIED SOME WRITERS BEGAN TO SAY THAT THE WORK CALLED SHAKESPEARE WERE NOT REALLY WRITTEN BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE. THEY HAD VARIOUS REASONS FOR SAYING THIS. FOR EXAMPLE THE PERSON WHO WROTE SHAKESPEARE KNEW A LOT ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY ITALY AND FRANCE BUT WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE NEVER LEFT ENGLAND.
SEVERAL OTHER WRITERS OF SHAKESPEARE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED SUCH AS FRANCIS BACON CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE AND EDWARD DE VERE 17TH EARL OF OXFORD. MOST SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE DID WRITE THE WORKS THAT BEAR HIS NAME. 
WORLD WAR I
WORLD WAR I OR THE FIRST WORLD WAR WAS A GLOBAL WAR WHICH BEGAN ON JULY 28 1914 AND LASTED UNTIL NOVEMBER 11 1918. THE WAR LASTED EXACTLY FOUR YEARS THREE MONTHS AND 14 DAYS.
MOST OF THE FIGHTING WAS IN EUROPE BUT SOLDIERS FROM MANY OTHER COUNTRIES TOOK PART AND IT CHANGED THE COLONIAL EMPIRES OF THE EUROPEAN POWERS. BEFORE WORLD WAR II BEGAN IN 1939 WORLD WAR I WAS CALLED THE GREAT WAR THE WORLD WAR OR THE WAR TO END ALL WARS. 135 COUNTRIES TOOK PART IN WORLD WAR I AND MORE THAN 9 MILLION PEOPLE DIED WHILE FIGHTING.
WORLD WAR I WAS FOUGHT BY MOST OF THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE. THE ACTUAL FIGHTING WAS ON MANY DIFFERENT FRONTS. THE WESTERN FRONT WAS WHERE MOST OF THE FIGHTING BETWEEN GERMANY AND THE ALLIES HAPPENED. MOST OF THE FIGHTING HERE WAS TRENCH WARFARE.
THE EASTERN FRONT WAS FOUGHT IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE. FIGHTING HERE WAS NOT TRENCH WARFARE BUT MOBILE WARFARE DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE FRONT. MUCH FIGHTING HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE EASTERN FRONT AND THE ITALIAN FRONT. FIGHTING ALSO TOOK PLACE IN AFRICA CHINA AND AT SEA AS WELL AS IN THE AIR.
THE WAR WAS ENDED BY THE SIGNING OF MANY DIFFERENT TREATIES THE MOST IMPORTANT BEING THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES.
WORLD WAR I WAS THE FIRST MAJOR WAR WHERE TANKS AIRPLANES AND SUBMARINES OR U BOATS WERE IMPORTANT WEAPONS.
IN THE ORGANIZATION ONE PERSON WHO STRONGLY SUPPORTED SERBIAN POWER SENT MEN TO KILL ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND OF AUSTRIA. THEY ALL FAILED TO KILL HIM WITH GRENADES WHILE HE PASSED THROUGH A LARGE CROWD BUT ONE OF THESE MEN A SERBIAN STUDENT NAMED GAVRILO PRINCIP SHOT HIM AND HIS PREGNANT WIFE WITH A PISTOL.
AUSTRIA HUNGARY BLAMED SERBIA FOR THE ASSASSINATION. GERMANY SUPPORTED AUSTRIA HUNGARY AND PROMISED FULL SUPPORT SHOULD IT COME TO WAR. AUSTRIA HUNGARY SENT A JULY ULTIMATUM TO SERBIA LISTING 10 VERY STRICT CONDITIONS POSSIBLY BECAUSE THEY WANTED AN EXCUSE TO START THE WAR. SERBIA AGREED TO MOST OF THE TEN THINGS ON THE LIST BUT NOT ALL OF THEM. AUSTRIA HUNGARY THEN DECLARED WAR ON SERBIA. THIS QUICKLY LED TO A FULL SCALE WAR. BOTH COUNTRIES ALLIES BECAME INVOLVED IN THE WAR IN A MATTER OF DAYS.
RUSSIA JOINED THE WAR ON SERBIA S SIDE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF SERBIA WERE SLAVIC LIKE RUSSIA AND THE SLAVIC COUNTRIES HAD AGREED TO HELP EACH OTHER IF THEY WERE ATTACKED. SINCE RUSSIA IS A LARGE COUNTRY IT HAD TO MOVE SOLDIERS CLOSER TO THE WAR BUT GERMANY FEARED THAT RUSSIA S SOLDIERS WOULD ALSO ATTACK GERMANY. RUSSIA DID NOT LIKE GERMANY BECAUSE OF THINGS GERMANY HAD DONE IN THE PAST TO BECOME STRONGER. GERMANY DECLARED WAR ON RUSSIA AND BEGAN TO CARRY OUT A PLAN CREATED LONG BEFORE TO FIGHT A WAR IN EUROPE. BECAUSE GERMANY IS IN THE MIDDLE OF EUROPE GERMANY COULD NOT ATTACK TO THE EAST TOWARDS RUSSIA WITHOUT WEAKENING ITSELF IN THE WEST TOWARDS FRANCE. GERMANY S PLAN INVOLVED QUICKLY DEFEATING FRANCE IN THE WEST BEFORE RUSSIA WAS READY TO FIGHT AND THEN MOVING HER ARMIES TO THE EAST TO FACE RUSSIA. GERMANY COULD NOT QUICKLY INVADE FRANCE DIRECTLY BECAUSE FRANCE HAD PUT A LOT OF FORTS ON THE BORDER SO GERMANY INVADED THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY OF BELGIUM TO THEN INVADE FRANCE THROUGH THE UNDEFENDED FRENCH BELGIAN BORDER. GREAT BRITAIN THEN JOINED THE WAR BECAUSE GREAT BRITAIN HAD AGREED TO HELP BELGIUM IF IT WERE EVER ATTACKED BY SOMEONE ELSE.
SOON MOST OF EUROPE BECAME INVOLVED.
GERMANY WAS ALLIED WITH AUSTRIA HUNGARY. RUSSIA WAS ALLIED WITH SERBIA. THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT WAS AFRAID THAT BECAUSE AUSTRIA HUNGARY HAD ATTACKED SERBIA RUSSIA WOULD ATTACK AUSTRIA HUNGARY TO HELP SERBIA. BECAUSE OF THIS GERMANY FELT IT HAD TO HELP AUSTRIA HUNGARY BY ATTACKING RUSSIA FIRST BEFORE IT COULD ATTACK AUSTRIA HUNGARY.
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT RUSSIA WAS ALSO FRIENDS WITH FRANCE AND THE GERMANS THOUGHT THE FRENCH MIGHT ATTACK THEM TO HELP RUSSIA. SO THE GERMANS DECIDED THAT THEY COULD WIN THE WAR IF THEY ATTACKED FRANCE FIRST AND QUICKLY. THEY COULD MOBILIZE VERY QUICKLY. THEY HAD A LIST OF ALL THE MEN WHO HAD TO JOIN THE ARMY AND WHERE THOSE MEN HAD TO GO AND THE TIMES OF EVERY TRAIN THAT WOULD CARRY THOSE MEN TO WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE TO FIGHT. FRANCE WAS DOING THE SAME THING BUT COULD NOT DO IT AS QUICKLY. THE GERMANS THOUGHT THAT IF THEY ATTACKED FRANCE FIRST THEY COULD KNOCK FRANCE OUT OF THE WAR BEFORE RUSSIA COULD ATTACK THEM.
RUSSIA HAD A BIG ARMY BUT GERMANY THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD TAKE SIX WEEKS TO MOBILIZE AND A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY COULD ATTACK THE CENTRAL POWERS. THAT WASN T TRUE BECAUSE THE RUSSIAN ARMY MOBILIZED IN TEN DAYS. ALSO THE RUSSIANS DROVE DEEP INTO AUSTRIA.
GREAT BRITAIN WAS ALLIED WITH BELGIUM AND BECAME QUICKLY INVOLVED IN THE WAR. BRITAIN HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT BELGIAN NEUTRALITY. GERMANY ATTACKED BELGIUM TO REACH PARIS BEFORE RUSSIA COULD MOBILIZE AND OPEN UP A SECOND FRONT AGAINST THEM. ON AUGUST 4 1914 BRITAIN DECLARED WAR AGAINST GERMANY IN SUPPORT OF BELGIUM. BRITAIN HAD THE BIGGEST EMPIRE IT RULED OVER A QUARTER OF THE WORLD. IF GERMANY CONQUERED FRANCE IT MIGHT TAKE BRITAIN AND FRANCE S COLONIES AND BECOME THE MOST POWERFUL AND BIGGEST EMPIRE IN THE WORLD.
BRITAIN WAS ALSO WORRIED ABOUT GERMANY S GROWING MILITARY POWER. GERMANY WAS DEVELOPING ITS LARGE ARMY INTO ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL IN THE WORLD. THE BRITISH ARMY WAS QUITE SMALL. THE BRITISH ROYAL NAVY WAS THE LARGEST AND BEST IN THE WORLD AND IN THE 19TH CENTURY THAT WAS ENOUGH TO KEEP OTHER NAVAL POWERS FROM ATTACKING. GERMANY WAS A LAND POWER AND BRITAIN WAS A SEA POWER. BUT NOW THE GERMANS WERE BUILDING A LARGE NAVY. THIS WAS SEEN AS A THREAT TO BRITAIN. HOWEVER THE DECISION TO DECLARE WAR WAS TAKEN UNDER ITS ALLIANCE WITH BELGIUM IN THE TREATY OF LONDON 1839. THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT HAVE DECIDED DIFFERENTLY. NO ONE FORESAW HOW LONG THE WAR WOULD LAST AND WHAT THE TERRIBLE COSTS WOULD BE.
THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE TURKEY WENT INTO THE WAR BECAUSE IT WAS SECRETLY ALLIED TO GERMANY AND TWO TURKISH WARSHIPS MANNED BY GERMAN NAVY PERSONNEL BOMBARDED RUSSIAN TOWNS.
BRITAIN ALSO FOUGHT AGAINST TURKEY BECAUSE THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE WAS SUPPORTING GERMANY. BRITAIN DID NOT HAVE ANY ANIMOSITY TOWARDS THE TURKS. HOWEVER BY FIGHTING THE TURKS IN THE MESOPOTAMIA REGION IN WHAT IS NOW CALLED IRAQ IN THE ARABIAN PENINSULA AND OTHER PLACES BRITAIN WAS ABLE TO DEFEAT THEM WITH HELP FROM THE BRITISH INDIAN ARMY. LATER AFTER THE WAR ENDED BRITAIN WAS ABLE TO GET SOME AREAS FROM THE OLD TURKISH EMPIRE WHICH WAS BREAKING UP AND TO ADD THEM TO THE BRITISH EMPIRE.
GREECE WENT INTO THE WAR BECAUSE ITS LEADER SUPPORTED THE ALLIED CAUSE. GREECE AND SERBIA HAD BECOME INDEPENDENT BUT MANY GREEKS STILL LIVED IN LANDS THAT WERE ONCE GREEK BUT WERE NOW IN THE TURKISH OTTOMAN EMPIRE. HAVING RECENTLY WON THE BALKAN WARS THE GREEKS ESPECIALLY WANTED TO CONTROL OTHER LAND TO THE NORTH THAT WAS UNDER BULGARIAN AND TURKISH RULE SO THEY DECLARED WAR. TURKEY KILLED MOST OF THE GREEK ARMY AS THE GREEKS TRIED TO REGAIN PARTS OF TURKEY. ANOTHER WAR STARTED WHEN THE GREEKS BOMBED A TRAIN. TURKEY SWEPT GREECE BACK INTO THEIR OWN TERRITORY. FROM THEN ON THE GREEKS NEVER AGAIN DECLARED WAR WHILE TURKEY HAD ONE OF THE BIGGEST ARMIES IN THE WORLD.
BULGARIA LIKE GREECE AND SERBIA WAS OWNED BY TURKEY BEFORE BULGARIA BROKE AWAY FROM TURKEY. BULGARIA CLAIMED A LOT OF TURKISH LAND AS BELONGING TO BULGARIA. THE SERBIANS AND GREEKS FELT CHEATED BECAUSE THEY FELT THE LAND BELONGED TO GREECE OR SERBIA. THE GREEKS AND SERBIANS TOOK BACK THE LAND WHICH ANGERED BULGARIA AND LED TO THE COUNTRY BECOMING ALLIES WITH TURKEY. THEY DECLARED WAR ON SERBIA AND GREECE. BULGARIA LOST THIS WAR.
ROMANIA WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE CENTRAL POWERS UNTIL 1916 WHEN THEY WERE FORCED INTO THE WAR BY THE ALLIED POWERS.
MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT THE WAR WOULD BE SHORT. THEY THOUGHT THE ARMIES WOULD MOVE AROUND QUICKLY TO ATTACK EACH OTHER AND ONE WOULD DEFEAT THE OTHER WITHOUT TOO MANY PEOPLE GETTING KILLED. THEY THOUGHT THE WAR WOULD BE ABOUT BRAVE SOLDIERS THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW WAR HAD CHANGED. ONLY A FEW PEOPLE LIKE LORD KITCHENER SAID THAT THE WAR WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME.
GERMANY S GENERALS HAD DECIDED THAT THE BEST WAY TO DEFEAT FRANCE WAS TO GO THROUGH BELGIUM USING A PLAN CALLED THE SCHLIEFFEN PLAN. THIS WAS INVENTED BY THE GERMAN ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF ALFRED VON SCHLIEFFEN. THEY COULD THEN ATTACK THE FRENCH ARMY AT THE NORTH SIDE AND THE SOUTH SIDE AT THE SAME TIME. THE GERMAN ARMY WENT INTO BELGIUM ON AUGUST THE 4TH. ON THE SAME DAY GREAT BRITAIN STARTED A WAR ON GERMANY BECAUSE BRITAIN WAS A FRIEND OF BELGIUM. THE BRITISH HAD SAID SOME TIME BEFORE IN 1839 THAT THEY WOULD NOT LET ANYONE CONTROL BELGIUM AND THEY KEPT THEIR PROMISE.
WHEN THE GERMANS GOT TO THE BELGIAN CITY OF LI GE THE BELGIANS FOUGHT VERY HARD TO STOP THEM FROM COMING INTO THE CITY. THE GERMANS DID FINALLY PUSH THE BELGIANS OUT OF THE CITY BUT IT HAD TAKEN LONGER THAN THE GERMAN GENERALS HAD PLANNED. THEN THE GERMANS ATTACKED THE NORTH SIDE OF THE FRENCH ARMY. THE FRENCH AND THE BRITISH MOVED MEN UP TO FIGHT THE GERMANS. THEY COULD DO THIS BECAUSE THE BELGIANS HAD FOUGHT SO LONG AT LI GE. BUT THE GERMANS PUSHED THE FRENCH BACK AT THE FRONTIERS AND THE BRITISH HELD THE GERMANS BACK AT MONS BUT AFTERWARDS THEY ALSO FELL BACK TO JOIN UP WITH THE RETREATING FRENCH ARMY UNTIL THEY WERE STOPPED AT THE RIVER MARNE. THIS WAS THE FIRST BATTLE OF THE MARNE OR MIRACLE OF THE MARNE.
IN THE EAST THE RUSSIANS HAD ATTACKED THE GERMANS. THE RUSSIANS PUSHED BACK THE GERMANS BUT THEN THE GERMANS DEFEATED THE RUSSIANS AT THE BATTLE OF TANNENBERG.
TRENCH WARFARE KILLED GREAT NUMBERS OF SOLDIERS. NEW WEAPONS SUCH AS MACHINE GUNS AND LONG RANGE ARTILLERY HAD AN INCREASED RATE OF FIRE THAT CUT DOWN HUGE NUMBERS OF SOLDIERS DURING MASS CHARGES A TACTIC LEFTOVER FROM OLDER WARFARE. THE MEN ON BOTH SIDES TOOK SPADES AND DUG HOLES BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO BE KILLED. THE HOLES JOINED UP INTO TRENCHES UNTIL THE LINES OF TRENCHES WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SWITZERLAND TO THE NORTH SEA. IN FRONT OF THE TRENCHES THERE WAS BARBED WIRE THAT CUT ANYONE WHO TRIED TO CLIMB OVER IT AND LAND MINES THAT BLEW UP ANYONE WHO TRIED TO CROSS. LATE IN THE WAR POISON GAS WAS ALSO AN IMPORTANT WEAPON.
THE NEW MACHINE GUNS ARTILLERY TRENCHES AND MINES MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO ATTACK. THE GENERALS HAD FOUGHT MANY WARS WITHOUT THESE SO THEY ORDERED THEIR ARMIES TO ATTACK IN THE OLD STYLE OF MARCHING IN ROWS ALLOWING THE ENEMY TO SHOOT THEM DOWN EASILY. AT THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME IN 1916 60 000 BRITISH MEN DIED IN A SINGLE DAY. IT WAS ONE OF THE BLOODIEST DAYS IN THE HISTORY OF THE BRITISH ARMY. LATE IN THE WAR THE BRITISH AND FRENCH INVENTED TANKS AND USED THEM TO ATTACK ENTRENCHED GERMANS BUT COULD NOT MAKE ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. THE GERMANS INVENTED SPECIAL STURMABTEILUNG TACTICS TO INFILTRATE ENEMY POSITIONS BUT THEY ALSO WERE TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.
THE BRITISH USED WHISTLES TO COMMUNICATE TO OTHER SOLDIERS SO BEFORE THEY SHELLED THE GERMAN TRENCHES THEY WOULD SOUND THE WHISTLE. HOWEVER THE GERMANS CAUGHT ON TO THIS TACTIC AFTER A WHILE SO AFTER THE SHELLING WHEN THE BRITISH SOLDIERS CAME TO FINISH OFF THE GERMAN SOLDIERS THE GERMANS WERE READY WITH THEIR MACHINE GUNS BECAUSE THEY KNEW THE BRITISH WERE COMING.
AIRPLANES WERE FIRST USED EXTENSIVELY IN WORLD WAR I. AIRPLANES WERE NOT USED VERY MUCH IN FIGHTING BEFORE WORLD WAR I. IT WAS THE FIRST WAR TO USE AIRPLANES AS WEAPONS. AIRPLANES WERE FIRST USED FOR RECONNAISSANCE TO TAKE PICTURES OF ENEMY LAND AND TO DIRECT ARTILLERY. GENERALS MILITARY LEADERS WERE USING AIRPLANES AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR ATTACK PLANS AT THE END OF THE WAR. WORLD WAR I SHOWED THAT AIRPLANES COULD BE IMPORTANT WAR WEAPONS.
AIRPLANES IN WORLD WAR I WERE MADE OF WOOD AND CANVAS A TYPE OF ROUGH CLOTH. THEY DID NOT LAST FOR A LONG TIME. THEY COULD NOT FLY VERY FAST AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR. THEY COULD ONLY FLY UP TO 116 KILOMETERS PER HOUR OR 72 MILES PER HOUR. AT THE END OF THE WAR THEY COULD FLY UP TO 222 KILOMETERS PER HOUR OR 138 MILES PER HOUR. BUT THEY COULD NOT FLY AS FAST AS PLANES TODAY. GUNS WERE PUT ON PLANES FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING THE WAR. PILOTS PEOPLE WHO FLY THE PLANE USED THE GUNS TO SHOOT ENEMY PLANES. ONE PILOT USED METAL SHEETS PIECES OF METAL TO ARMOR HIS AIRPLANE. OTHER PILOTS BEGAN USING METAL SHEETS TOO. PILOTS ALSO MADE THEIR AIRPLANES BETTER WITH MACHINE GUNS GUNS THAT SHOOT BULLETS MUCH FASTER. MACHINE GUNS MADE FIGHTING HARDER AND MORE DANGEROUS BETWEEN AIRPLANES.
PILOTS HAD TO WEAR CERTAIN CLOTHES WHEN FLYING AN AIRPLANE IN WORLD WAR I BECAUSE THEY FLEW HIGH WHERE THE AIR IS COLD. THE PILOT S CLOTHES KEPT THEM WARM AND PROTECTED THEM FROM THE WIND AND COLD. PILOTS WORE A LEATHER COAT TO PROTECT THEIR BODIES. THEY WORE A PADDED HELMET AND GOGGLES LARGE GLASSES WITH SPECIAL LENSES TO PROTECT THEIR HEAD AND FACE. THEY WORE A SCARF AROUND THEIR NECK. THE SCARF KEPT THE WIND FROM BLOWING AGAINST THEIR NECK WHEN THEY TURNED THEIR HEAD.
THE GERMAN LEADERS DECIDED TO USE SUBMARINES. THESE SUBMARINES WERE NAMED U BOATS FROM THE GERMAN WORD UNTERSEEBOOT MEANING UNDERWATER BOAT. THE U BOATS ATTACKED PASSENGER SHIPS SUCH AS RMS LUSITANIA CARRYING CIVILIANS TO GREAT BRITAIN. THEY DID NOT FOLLOW THE LAWS OF WAR BECAUSE THE BRITISH WOULD BE ABLE TO DESTROY THEM IF THEY DID. AMERICA WAS SELLING WEAPONS TO GERMANY S ENEMIES AND NOT TO GERMANY THUS NOT BEING NEUTRAL. NEUTRAL MEANS A COUNTRY IS NOT INVOLVED IN THE WAR. MANY AMERICAN AND BRITISH NONCOMBATANTS WERE KILLED BY THE SUBMARINES.
GERMANY ALSO WROTE A SECRET TELEGRAM NOTE TO MEXICO IN CODE SUGGESTING THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES WORK TOGETHER TO ATTACK THE UNITED STATES. THIS NOTE IS CALLED THE ZIMMERMAN TELEGRAM BECAUSE ARTHUR ZIMMERMAN SENT IT. IT OFFERED MEXICO LAND IN THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES THAT THE UNITED STATES TOOK IN PREVIOUS WARS. SPIES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM FOUND OUT ABOUT THE NOTE AND TOLD THE UNITED STATES. AMERICAN PEOPLE BECAME ANGRY AND MANY DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED THEIR COUNTRY TO ENTER THE WAR AGAINST GERMANY. FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS ON APRIL 6 1917 THE UNITED STATES DECLARED WAR AGAINST GERMANY AND BECAME PART OF THE ALLIES.
THE DEFEAT OF RUSSIA ON THE EASTERN FRONT WORLD WAR I CAUSED UNREST INSIDE THE EMPIRE.
IN 1917 THERE WAS A REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA. THE TSAR NICHOLAS II HAD TO SAY HE WOULD NOT BE TSAR ANY MORE AND THAT THE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE POWER. AT FIRST IT WAS THOUGHT THAT RUSSIA WOULD FIGHT HARDER NOW THAT THE TSAR WAS GONE. HOWEVER THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE DIDN T WANT TO FIGHT ANYMORE BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT FOOD APPROPRIATE ARMAMENT OR ADEQUATE ROADS TO SUPPLY ITS ARMY. THE WAR HAD BEEN PUTTING BURDENS ON THEM AND MANY OF THEM WERE POOR AND HUNGRY. THEY BEGAN TO HATE THEIR NEW GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT WOULDN T STOP THE WAR.
THEN THERE WAS THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION. TWO FACTIONS FOUGHT TO RULE OVER RUSSIA. THE MENSHEVIKS LOST AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKS. THE LEADER OF THE BOLSHEVIKS WAS VLADIMIR LENIN 1870 1924 A COMMUNIST WHO FOLLOWED THE IDEAS OF KARL MARX. THE NEW GOVERNMENT ASKED THE GERMANS FOR PEACE AND SIGNED A PEACE TREATY CALLED BREST LITOVSK WITH THE CENTRAL POWERS IN MARCH 1918 AT THE CITY OF BREST LITOVSK. THE GERMANS AND RUSSIANS STOPPED FIGHTING. THIS GAVE GERMANY LAND IN EASTERN EUROPE AND THE BALTIC SEA.
AFTER THE WAR THE GERMANS HAD TO AGREE TO THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES. GERMANY HAD TO PAY APPROXIMATELY 31.5 BILLION IN REPARATIONS. THEY ALSO HAD TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WAR. PART OF THE TREATY SAID THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD SHOULD COME TOGETHER TO MAKE AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION TO STOP WARS FROM HAPPENING. THIS ORGANIZATION WAS CALLED THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. THE UNITED STATES SENATE DIDN T AGREE WITH THIS EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE IDEA OF THE US PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON. WOODROW WILSON TRIED TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD AGREE BUT THE UNITED STATES NEVER JOINED THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. PROBLEMS WITH THE TREATY IN GERMANY WOULD LATER LEAD TO THE SECOND WORLD WAR.
WORLD WAR II
WORLD WAR II WWII OR WW2 ALSO CALLED THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND IN THE SOVIET UNION THE GREAT PATRIOTIC WAR WAS A GLOBAL WAR INVOLVING FIGHTING IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD AND MANY COUNTRIES. MOST COUNTRIES FOUGHT 1939 1945 BUT SOME STARTED FIGHTING IN 1937. MOST OF THE WORLD S COUNTRIES INCLUDING ALL THE GREAT POWERS FOUGHT AS PART OF TWO MILITARY ALLIANCES THE ALLIES AND THE AXIS. EARLY IN THE WAR THE TWO SIDES WERE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL BUT THE AXIS POWERS WERE WINNING. BY THE END OF THE WAR MOST COUNTRIES HAD JOINED THE ALLIES.
WORLD WAR II WAS THE DEADLIEST CONFLICT IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY. IT INVOLVED MORE COUNTRIES COST MORE MONEY AND KILLED MORE PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER WAR IN HUMAN HISTORY. BETWEEN 50 TO 85 MILLION PEOPLE DIED. THE MAJORITY WERE CIVILIANS. IT INCLUDED MASSACRES THE DELIBERATE GENOCIDE OF THE HOLOCAUST STRATEGIC BOMBING STARVATION DISEASE AND THE FIRST USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN HISTORY.
THE WAR IN ASIA BEGAN WHEN THE EMPIRE OF JAPAN INVADED CHINA ON 7 JULY 1937.
THE START OF THE WAR IN EUROPE WAS WHEN GERMANY INVADED POLAND ON 1 SEPTEMBER 1939. FRANCE AND BRITAIN REACTED TO THE GERMAN INVASION OF POLAND BY DECLARING WAR ON GERMANY. THE UNITED STATES REACTED TO THE JAPANESE INVASION OF CHINA BY PLACING AN OIL EMBARGO ON JAPAN. BY 1941 MUCH OF EUROPE WAS UNDER GERMAN CONTROL. ONLY BRITAIN REMAINED FIGHTING AGAINST THE AXIS IN NORTH AFRICA THE MEDITERRANEAN AND THE ATLANTIC. IN JUNE 1941 THE AXIS POWERS INVADED THE SOVIET UNION STARTING THE LARGEST AREA OF WAR IN HISTORY. ON DECEMBER 7 1941 JAPAN ATTACKED WESTERN COLONIES IN THE PACIFIC AND THE TWO WARS BECAME ONE.
THE JAPANESE VICTORIES WERE STOPPED IN 1942 AND THE EUROPEAN AXIS VICTORIES WERE ALSO STOPPED BY 1943 BOTH IN NORTH AFRICA AND IN THE SOVIET UNION. AFTER THAT THE ALLIES STARTED TO FIGHT BACK FROM ALL SIDES. THE AXIS LOST NORTH AFRICA AND STARTING IN 1943 WERE FORCED TO DEFEND ITALY. IN 1944 THE ALLIES INVADED FRANCE HEADING TOWARDS GERMANY ON THE RHINE RIVER WHILE THE SOVIETS KEPT CLOSING IN FROM THE EAST. GERMANY SURRENDERED IN MAY 1945. JAPAN FORMALLY SURRENDERED ON 2 SEPTEMBER 1945. THE WAR ENDED WITH THE ALLIED VICTORY.
AFTER THE WAR THE UNITED NATIONS WAS SET UP TO DEVELOP SUPPORT BETWEEN COUNTRIES AND TO PREVENT FUTURE WARS. THE COLD WAR AMONG THE MAJOR WINNERS SOON STARTED BUT THEY DID NOT FIGHT EACH OTHER IN AN ACTUAL WAR. DECOLONIZATION OF ASIA AND AFRICA WHERE THOSE COUNTRIES CONTROLLED BY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WERE GIVEN THEIR INDEPENDENCE HAPPENED AS WELL. THIS WAS BECAUSE EUROPEAN POWER WAS WEAKENED FROM THE WAR. ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND THE POLITICAL INTEGRATION THE PROCESS OF UNITING COUNTRIES WERE AMONG OTHER RESULTS OF THE WAR.
THE COUNTRIES THAT JOINED THE WAR WERE ON ONE OF TWO SIDES THE AXIS AND THE ALLIES.
THE AXIS POWERS AT THE START OF THE WAR WERE GERMANY ITALY AND JAPAN. THERE WERE MANY MEETINGS TO CREATE THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN THESE COUNTRIES. FINLAND SLOVAKIA ROMANIA BULGARIA HUNGARY AND THAILAND JOINED THE AXIS LATER. AS THE WAR CONTINUED SOME AXIS COUNTRIES CHANGED TO JOIN THE ALLIES INSTEAD.
THE ALLIED POWERS WERE THE UNITED KINGDOM AND SOME COMMONWEALTH MEMBERS FRANCE POLAND YUGOSLAVIA GREECE BELGIUM AND CHINA AT THE START OF THE WAR. IN JUNE 1941 GERMANY ATTACKED THE SOVIET UNION IN OPERATION BARBAROSSA. IN DECEMBER 1941 CAME JAPAN S ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. THESE TWO LARGE POWERFUL COUNTRIES THEN JOINED THE ALLIES.
WORLD WAR I HAD GREATLY CHANGED THE WAY OF DIPLOMACY AND POLITICS IN ASIA EUROPE AND AFRICA WITH THE DEFEAT OF THE CENTRAL POWERS. EMPIRES WHICH SIDED WITH THE CENTRAL POWERS WERE DESTROYED. THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE WHICH DID NOT SIDE WITH THE CENTRAL POWERS DIED AS WELL. THE WAR ALSO CHANGED THE BORDERS IN EASTERN EUROPE WITH MANY NEW COUNTRIES BORN. THE WAR LED TO STRONG IRREDENTISM AND REVANCHISM. THESE SENSES WERE ESPECIALLY STRONG IN GERMANY WHICH HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO SIGN THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES. THE GERMANS ALSO HAD 13 OF THEIR HOMELAND AREA AND ALL COLONIES TAKEN AWAY AND THEY HAD TO PAY BACK A VERY LARGE SUM OF MONEY TO THE ALLIES. THE SIZE OF THEIR ARMY AND NAVY WAS ALSO LIMITED WHILE ITS AIR FORCE WAS BANNED. 
IN ITALY NATIONALISTS WERE UNHAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE WAR THINKING THAT THEIR COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE GAINED FAR MORE TERRITORY FROM THE PAST AGREEMENT WITH THE ALLIES. THE FASCIST MOVEMENT IN THE 1920S BROUGHT MUSSOLINI TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COUNTRY. HE PROMISED TO MAKE ITALY A GREAT POWER BY CREATING ITS COLONIAL EMPIRE.
AFTER THE KUOMINTANG KMT THE GOVERNING PARTY OF CHINA UNIFIED THE COUNTRY IN THE 1920S THE CIVIL WAR BETWEEN IT AND ITS PAST ALLY COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA BEGAN. IN 1931 JAPAN USED THE MUKDEN INCIDENT AS A REASON TO TAKE MANCHURIA AND SET UP ITS PUPPET STATE MANCHUKUO WHILE THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS COULD NOT DO ANYTHING TO STOP IT. THE TANGGU TRUCE A CEASEFIRE WAS SIGNED IN 1933. IN 1936 THE KMT AND THE COMMUNISTS AGREED TO STOP FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER TO FIGHT JAPAN INSTEAD. IN 1937 JAPAN STARTED A SECOND SINO JAPANESE WAR TO TAKE THE REST OF CHINA.
AFTER THE GERMAN EMPIRE WAS DISESTABLISHED THE DEMOCRATIC WEIMAR REPUBLIC WAS SET UP. THERE WERE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE GERMANS WHICH INVOLVED MANY POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES RANGING FROM NATIONALISM TO COMMUNISM. THE FASCIST MOVEMENT IN GERMANY ROSE BECAUSE OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. ADOLF HITLER LEADER OF THE NAZI PARTY BECAME THE CHANCELLOR IN 1933. AFTER THE REICHSTAG FIRE HITLER CREATED A TOTALITARIAN STATE WHERE THERE IS ONLY ONE PARTY BY LAW. HITLER WANTED TO CHANGE THE WORLD ORDER AND QUICKLY REBUILT THE ARMY NAVY AND AIR FORCE ESPECIALLY AFTER SAARLAND WAS REUNITED IN 1935. IN MARCH 1936 HITLER SENT THE ARMY TO RHINELAND. THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR BEGAN IN JULY 1936. THE WAR ENDED WITH THE NATIONALIST VICTORY SUPPORTED BY ITALY AND GERMANY.
IN MARCH 1938 GERMANY SENT ITS ARMY INTO AUSTRIA WHICH HAD ONLY A LITTLE REACTION FROM EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. SHORTLY AFTER THAT THE ALLIES AGREED TO GIVE SUDETENLAND PART OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA TO GERMANY SO THAT HITLER WOULD PROMISE TO STOP TAKING MORE LAND. BUT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WAS EITHER FORCED TO SURRENDER OR INVADED BY MARCH 1939. THE ALLIES NOW TRIED TO STOP HIM BY PROMISING TO HELP POLAND IF IT WAS ATTACKED. JUST BEFORE THE WAR GERMANY AND THE SOVIET UNION SIGNED A PEACE AGREEMENT AGREEING THAT THEY WOULD NOT ATTACK EACH OTHER FOR TEN YEARS. IN THE SECRET PART OF IT THEY AGREED TO DIVIDE EASTERN EUROPE BETWEEN THEM.
WORLD WAR II BEGAN ON 1 SEPTEMBER 1939 AS GERMANY INVADED POLAND. ON 3 SEPTEMBER BRITAIN FRANCE AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH DECLARED WAR ON GERMANY. THEY COULD NOT HELP POLAND MUCH AND ONLY SENT A SMALL FRENCH ATTACK ON GERMANY FROM THE WEST. THE SOVIET UNION INVADED EASTERN POLAND SOON AFTER GERMANY ON 17 SEPTEMBER. FINALLY POLAND WAS DIVIDED.
GERMANY THEN SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE SOVIET UNION. THE SOVIET UNION FORCED THE BALTIC COUNTRIES TO ALLOW IT TO KEEP SOVIET SOLDIERS IN THEIR COUNTRIES. FINLAND DID NOT ACCEPT THE SOVIET CALL FOR ITS LAND SO IT WAS ATTACKED IN NOVEMBER 1939. WITH PEACE THE WORLD WAR BROKE OUT. FRANCE AND BRITAIN THOUGHT THAT THE SOVIET UNION MIGHT ENTER THE WAR ON THE SIDE OF GERMANY AND DROVE THE SOVIET UNION OUT OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.
AFTER POLAND WAS DEFEATED THE PHONEY WAR BEGAN IN WESTERN EUROPE. WHILE BRITISH SOLDIERS WERE SENT TO THE CONTINENT THERE WERE NO BIG BATTLES FOUGHT BETWEEN TWO SIDES. THEN IN APRIL 1940 GERMANY DECIDED TO ATTACK NORWAY AND DENMARK SO THAT IT WOULD BE SAFER TO TRANSPORT IRON ORE FROM SWEDEN. THE BRITISH AND FRENCH SENT AN ARMY TO DISRUPT THE GERMAN OCCUPATION BUT HAD TO LEAVE WHEN GERMANY INVADED FRANCE. CHAMBERLAIN WAS REPLACED BY CHURCHILL AS PRIME MINISTER OF UNITED KINGDOM IN MAY 1940 BECAUSE THE BRITISH WERE UNHAPPY WITH HIS WORK.
ON 10 MAY GERMANY INVADED FRANCE BELGIUM HOLLAND AND LUXEMBOURG AND QUICKLY DEFEATED THEM BY USING BLITZKRIEG TACTICS. THE BRITISH WERE FORCED TO LEAVE MAINLAND EUROPE AT DUNKIRK. ON 10 JUNE ITALY INVADED FRANCE DECLARING WAR ON FRANCE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. SOON AFTER THAT FRANCE WAS DIVIDED INTO OCCUPATION ZONES. ONE WAS DIRECTLY CONTROLLED BY GERMANY AND ITALY AND THE OTHER WAS UNOCCUPIED VICHY FRANCE.
BY JUNE 1940 THE SOVIET UNION MOVED ITS SOLDIERS INTO THE BALTIC STATES AND TOOK THEM FOLLOWED BY BESSARABIA IN ROMANIA. ALTHOUGH THERE HAD BEEN SOME COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE SOVIET UNION AND GERMANY EARLIER THIS EVENT MADE IT SERIOUS. LATER WHEN THE TWO COULD NOT AGREE TO WORK MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM BECAME WORSE TO THE POINT OF WAR.
THEN GERMANY BEGAN AN AIR BATTLE OVER BRITAIN TO PREPARE FOR A LANDING ON THE ISLAND BUT THE PLAN WAS FINALLY CANCELED IN SEPTEMBER. THE GERMAN NAVY DESTROYED MANY BRITISH SHIPS TRANSPORTING GOODS IN THE ATLANTIC. ITALY BY THIS TIME HAD BEGUN ITS OPERATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. THE UNITED STATES REMAINED NEUTRAL BUT STARTED TO HELP THE ALLIES. BY HELPING TO PROTECT BRITISH SHIPS IN THE ATLANTIC THE UNITED STATES FOUND ITSELF FIGHTING GERMAN SHIPS BY OCTOBER 1941 BUT THIS WAS NOT OFFICIALLY WAR.
IN SEPTEMBER 1940 ITALY BEGAN TO INVADE BRITISH HELD EGYPT. IN OCTOBER ITALY INVADED GREECE BUT IT ONLY RESULTED IN AN ITALIAN RETREAT TO ALBANIA. AGAIN IN EARLY 1941 AN ITALIAN ARMY WAS PUSHED FROM EGYPT TO LIBYA IN AFRICA. GERMANY SOON HELPED ITALY. UNDER ROMMEL S COMMAND BY THE END OF APRIL 1941 THE COMMONWEALTH ARMY WAS PUSHED BACK TO EGYPT AGAIN. OTHER THAN NORTH AFRICA GERMANY ALSO SUCCESSFULLY INVADED GREECE YUGOSLAVIA AND CRETE BY MAY. DESPITE THESE VICTORIES HITLER DECIDED TO CANCEL THE BOMBING OF BRITAIN AFTER 11 MAY.
AT THE SAME TIME JAPAN S PROGRESS IN CHINA WAS STILL NOT MUCH ALTHOUGH THE NATIONALIST AND COMMUNIST CHINESE BEGAN FIGHTING EACH OTHER AGAIN. JAPAN WAS PLANNING TO TAKE OVER EUROPEAN COLONIES IN ASIA WHILE THEY WERE WEAK AND THE SOVIET UNION COULD FEEL A DANGER FROM GERMANY SO A NON AGGRESSION PACT WHICH WAS AN AGREEMENT THAT BOTH COUNTRIES WOULD NOT ATTACK EACH OTHER BETWEEN THE TWO WAS SIGNED IN APRIL 1941. HOWEVER GERMANY KEPT PREPARING AN ATTACK ON THE SOVIET UNION MOVING ITS SOLDIERS CLOSE TO THE SOVIET BORDER.
ON 22 JUNE 1941 THE EUROPEAN AXIS COUNTRIES ATTACKED THE SOVIET UNION. DURING THE SUMMER THE AXIS QUICKLY CAPTURED UKRAINE AND THE BALTIC REGIONS WHICH CAUSED HUGE DAMAGE TO THE SOVIETS. BRITAIN AND THE SOVIET UNION FORMED A MILITARY ALLIANCE BETWEEN THEM IN JULY. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS GREAT PROGRESS IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS WHEN WINTER ARRIVED THE TIRED GERMAN ARMY WAS FORCED TO DELAY ITS ATTACK JUST OUTSIDE MOSCOW. IT SHOWED THAT THE AXIS HAD FAILED ITS MAIN TARGETS WHILE THE SOVIET ARMY WAS STILL NOT WEAKENED. THIS MARKED THE END OF THE BLITZKRIEG STAGE OF THE WAR.
BY DECEMBER THE RED ARMY FACING THE AXIS ARMY HAD RECEIVED MORE SOLDIERS FROM THE EAST. IT BEGAN A COUNTER ATTACK THAT PUSHED THE GERMAN ARMY TO THE WEST. THE AXIS LOST A LOT OF SOLDIERS BUT IT STILL SAVED MOST OF THE LAND IT RECEIVED BEFORE.
BY NOVEMBER 1941 THE COMMONWEALTH COUNTER ATTACKED THE AXIS IN NORTH AFRICA AND GOT ALL THE LAND IT LOST BEFORE. HOWEVER THE AXIS PUSHED THE ALLIES BACK AGAIN UNTIL STOPPED AT EL ALAMEIN.
IN ASIA GERMAN SUCCESSES ENCOURAGED JAPAN TO CALL FOR OIL SUPPLIES FROM THE DUTCH EAST INDIES. MANY WESTERN COUNTRIES REACTED TO THE OCCUPATION OF FRENCH INDOCHINA BY BANNING OIL TRADING WITH JAPAN. JAPAN PLANNED TO TAKE OVER EUROPEAN COLONIES IN ASIA TO CREATE A GREAT DEFENSIVE AREA IN THE PACIFIC SO THAT IT COULD GET MORE RESOURCES. BUT BEFORE ANY FUTURE INVASION IT FIRST HAD TO DESTROY THE AMERICAN PACIFIC FLEET IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN. ON 7 DECEMBER 1941 IT ATTACKED PEARL HARBOR AS WELL AS MANY HARBORS IN SEVERAL SOUTH EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES. THIS EVENT LED THE UNITED STATES UNITED KINGDOM AUSTRALIA WESTERN ALLIES AND CHINA TO DECLARE WAR ON JAPAN WHILE THE SOVIET UNION REMAINED NEUTRAL. MOST OF THE AXIS NATIONS REACTED BY DECLARING WAR ON THE UNITED STATES.
BY APRIL 1942 MANY SOUTH EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES BURMA MALAYA THE DUTCH EAST INDIES AND SINGAPORE HAD ALMOST FALLEN TO THE JAPANESE. IN MAY 1942 THE PHILIPPINES FELL. THE JAPANESE NAVY HAD MANY QUICK VICTORIES. BUT IN JUNE 1942 JAPAN WAS DEFEATED AT MIDWAY. JAPAN COULD NOT TAKE MORE LAND AFTER THIS BECAUSE A LARGE PART OF ITS NAVY WAS DESTROYED DURING THE BATTLE.
JAPAN THEN BEGAN ITS PLAN TO TAKE OVER PAPUA NEW GUINEA AGAIN WHILE THE UNITED STATES PLANNED TO ATTACK THE SOLOMON ISLANDS. THE FIGHT ON GUADALCANAL BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER 1942 AND INVOLVED A LOT OF TROOPS AND SHIPS FROM BOTH SIDES. IT ENDED WITH THE JAPANESE DEFEAT IN EARLY 1943.
ON THE EASTERN FRONT THE AXIS DEFEATED SOVIET ATTACKS DURING SUMMER AND BEGAN ITS OWN MAIN OFFENSIVE TO SOUTHERN RUSSIA ALONG DON AND VOLGA RIVERS IN JUNE 1942 TRYING TO TAKE OVER OIL FIELDS IN CAUCASUS AND A GREAT STEPPE. STALINGRAD WAS IN THE PATH OF THE AXIS ARMY AND THE SOVIETS DECIDED TO DEFEND THE CITY. BY NOVEMBER THE GERMANS HAD NEARLY TAKEN STALINGRAD HOWEVER THE SOVIETS WERE ABLE TO SURROUND THE GERMANS DURING WINTER AFTER HEAVY LOSSES THE GERMAN ARMY WAS FORCED TO SURRENDER THE CITY IN FEBRUARY 1943. EVEN THOUGH THE FRONT WAS PUSHED BACK FURTHER THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE SUMMER ATTACKS THE GERMAN ARMY STILL HAD BECOME DANGEROUS TO AN AREA AROUND KURSK.
IN AUGUST 1942 BECAUSE OF THE ALLIED DEFENSE AT EL ALAMEIN THE AXIS ARMY FAILED TO TAKE THE TOWN. A NEW ALLIED OFFENSIVE DROVE THE AXIS WEST ACROSS LIBYA A FEW MONTHS LATER JUST AFTER THE ANGLO AMERICAN INVASION OF FRENCH NORTH AFRICA FORCED IT TO JOIN THE ALLIES. THIS LED TO AXIS DEFEAT IN THE NORTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGN MAY 1943.
IN THE SOVIET UNION ON 4 JULY 1943 GERMANY STARTED AN ATTACK AROUND KURSK. MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS WERE LOST BECAUSE OF THE SOVIETS WELL CREATED DEFENSES. HITLER CANCELED THE ATTACK BEFORE ANY CLEAR OUTCOME. THE SOVIETS THEN STARTED THEIR OWN COUNTER ATTACK WHICH WAS ONE OF THE TURNING POINTS OF THE WAR. AFTER THIS THE SOVIETS BECAME THE ATTACKING FORCE ON THE EASTERN FRONT INSTEAD OF THE GERMANS.
ON 9 JULY 1943 AFFECTED BY THE EARLIER SOVIET VICTORIES THE WESTERN ALLIES LANDED ON SICILY. THIS RESULTED IN THE ARREST OF MUSSOLINI IN THE SAME MONTH. IN SEPTEMBER 1943 THE ALLIES INVADED MAINLAND ITALY FOLLOWING THE ITALIAN ARMISTICE WITH THE ALLIES. GERMANY THEN TOOK CONTROL OF ITALY AND DISARMED ITS ARMY AND BUILT UP MANY DEFENSIVE LINES TO SLOW THE ALLIED INVASION DOWN. GERMAN SPECIAL FORCES THEN RESCUED MUSSOLINI WHO THEN SOON CREATED THE GERMAN OCCUPIED CLIENT STATE ITALIAN SOCIAL REPUBLIC.
IN EARLY 1944 THE SOVIET ARMY DROVE OFF THE GERMAN ARMY FROM LENINGRAD ENDING THE LONGEST AND DEADLIEST SIEGE IN HISTORY. AFTER THAT THE SOVIETS BEGAN A BIG COUNTER ATTACK. BY MAY THE SOVIETS HAD RETAKEN CRIMEA. WITH THE ATTACKS IN ITALY FROM SEPTEMBER 1943 THE ALLIES SUCCEEDED IN CAPTURING ROME ON 4 JUNE 1944 AND MADE THE GERMAN FORCES FALL BACK.
ON D DAY 6 JUNE 1944 THE ALLIES BEGAN THE INVASION OF NORMANDY FRANCE. THE CODE NAME FOR THE INVASION WAS OPERATION OVERLORD. THE INVASION WAS SUCCESSFUL AND LED TO THE DEFEAT OF THE GERMAN FORCES IN FRANCE. PARIS WAS LIBERATED ON AUGUST 1944 AND THE ALLIES CONTINUED EASTWARD WHILE THE GERMAN FRONT COLLAPSED. OPERATION MARKET GARDEN WAS THE COMBINED AERIAL INVASION OF THE NETHERLANDS LAUNCHED ON 17 SEPTEMBER 1944. THE PURPOSE OF THE INVASION WAS TO SEIZE A SERIES OF BRIDGES THAT INCLUDED A BRIDGE IN ARNHEM WHICH SPANNED THE RHINE RIVER. MARKET WAS THE NAME FOR THE AIRBORNE INVASION. THE GROUND INVASION NAMED GARDEN REACHED THE RHINE RIVER BUT COULD NOT TAKE THE ARNHEM BRIDGE..
ON 22 JUNE THE SOVIET OFFENSIVE ON THE EASTERN FRONT CODENAMED OPERATION BAGRATION ALMOST DESTROYED THE GERMAN ARMY GROUP CENTRE. SOON AFTER THE GERMANS WERE FORCED TO RETREAT AND DEFEND UKRAINE AND POLAND. ARRIVING SOVIET TROOPS CAUSED UPRISINGS AGAINST THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT IN EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BUT THESE FAILED TO SUCCEED UNLESS HELPED BY THE SOVIETS. ANOTHER SOVIET OFFENSIVE FORCED ROMANIA AND BULGARIA TO JOIN THE ALLIES. COMMUNIST SERBS PARTISANS UNDER JOSIP BROZ TITO RETOOK BELGRADE WITH SOME HELP FROM BULGARIA AND THE SOVIET UNION. BY EARLY 1945 THE SOVIETS ATTACKED MANY GERMAN OCCUPIED COUNTRIES GREECE ALBANIA YUGOSLAVIA AND HUNGARY. FINLAND SWITCHED TO THE SIDE OF THE SOVIETS AND ALLIES.
ON 16 DECEMBER 1944 THE GERMANS TRIED ONE LAST TIME TO TAKE THE WESTERN FRONT BY ATTACKING THE ALLIES IN ARDENNES BELGIUM IN A BATTLE IS KNOWN AS THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE. THIS WAS THE LAST MAJOR GERMAN ATTACK OF THE WAR AND THE GERMANS WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR ATTACK. 
BY MARCH 1945 THE SOVIET ARMY MOVED QUICKLY FROM VISTULA RIVER IN POLAND TO EAST PRUSSIA AND VIENNA WHILE THE WESTERN ALLIES CROSSED THE RHINE. IN ITALY THE ALLIES PUSHED FORWARD WHILE THE SOVIETS ATTACKED BERLIN. THE ALLIED WESTERN FORCES WOULD EVENTUALLY MEET UP WITH THE SOVIETS AT THE ELBE RIVER ON 25 APRIL 1945.
HITLER COMMITTED SUICIDE ON 30 APRIL 1945 TWO DAYS AFTER MUSSOLINI S DEATH. IN HIS WILL HE APPOINTED HIS NAVY COMMANDER GRAND ADMIRAL KARL D NITZ TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF GERMANY. D NITZ SURRENDERED TO THE ALLIES AND OPPOSED HITLER S WILL TO HAVE GERMANY CONTINUE FIGHTING.
GERMAN FORCES IN ITALY SURRENDERED ON 29 APRIL 1945. GERMANY SURRENDERED TO THE WESTERN ALLIES ON 7 MAY 1945 KNOWN AS V E DAY AND WAS FORCED TO SURRENDER TO THE SOVIETS ON 8 MAY 1945. THE FINAL BATTLE IN EUROPE WAS ENDED IN ITALY ON 11 MAY 1945.
IN THE PACIFIC AMERICAN FORCES ARRIVED IN THE PHILIPPINES ON JUNE 1944. AND BY APRIL 1945 AMERICAN AND PHILIPPINE FORCES HAD CLEARED MUCH OF THE JAPANESE FORCES BUT THE FIGHTING CONTINUED IN SOME PARTS OF THE PHILIPPINES UNTIL THE END OF THE WAR. BRITISH AND CHINESE FORCES ADVANCED IN NORTHERN BURMA AND CAPTURED RANGOON BY 3 MAY 1945. AMERICAN FORCES THEN TOOK IWO JIMA BY MARCH AND OKINAWA BY JUNE 1945. MANY JAPANESE CITIES WERE DESTROYED BY ALLIED BOMBINGS AND JAPANESE IMPORTS WERE CUT OFF BY AMERICAN SUBMARINES.
THE ALLIES WANTED JAPAN TO SURRENDER WITH NO TERMS BUT JAPAN REFUSED. THIS RESULTED IN THE UNITED STATES DROPPING TWO ATOMIC BOMBS OVER HIROSHIMA 6 AUGUST 1945 AND NAGASAKI 9 AUGUST 1945. ON 8 AUGUST 1945 THE SOVIETS INVADED MANCHURIA QUICKLY DEFEATING THE PRIMARY IMPERIAL JAPANESE ARMY THERE. ON 15 AUGUST 1945 JAPAN SURRENDERED TO THE ALLIES. THE SURRENDER DOCUMENTS WERE FORMALLY SIGNED ON BOARD THE USS MISSOURI ON 2 SEPTEMBER 1945 ENDING THE WAR.
THE ALLIES MANAGED TO OCCUPY AUSTRIA AND GERMANY. GERMANY WAS DIVIDED INTO WESTERN AND EASTERN PARTS UNDER THE WESTERN ALLIES AND SOVIET CONTROL RESPECTIVELY. THE ALLIES BEGAN DENAZIFICATION REMOVING NAZI IDEAS FROM HISTORY AND MOST HIGH RANKING NAZIS WERE CAPTURED AND BROUGHT TO A SPECIAL COURT. GERMANY LOST A QUARTER OF THE LAND IT HAD IN 1937 WITH THE LAND GIVEN TO POLAND AND THE SOVIET UNION. THE SOVIETS ALSO TOOK SOME PARTS OF POLAND AND FINLAND AS WELL AS THREE BALTIC COUNTRIES.
THE UNITED NATIONS WAS FORMED ON 24 OCTOBER 1945 TO KEEP PEACE BETWEEN COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. HOWEVER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WESTERN ALLIES AND THE SOVIET UNION HAD WORSENED DURING THE WAR AND SOON AFTER THE WAR EACH POWER QUICKLY BUILT UP THEIR POWER OVER CONTROLLED AREA. IN WESTERN EUROPE AND WEST GERMANY IT WAS THE UNITED STATES WHILE IN EAST GERMANY AND EASTERN EUROPE IT WAS THE SOVIET UNION IN WHICH MANY COUNTRIES WERE TURNED INTO COMMUNIST STATES. THE COLD WAR STARTED AFTER THE FORMATION OF THE AMERICAN LED NATO AND THE SOVIET LED WARSAW PACT.
IN ASIA JAPAN WAS PUT UNDER AMERICAN OCCUPATION. IN 1948 KOREA WAS DIVIDED INTO NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA EACH CLAIMING TO BE THE LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE KOREANS WHICH LED TO THE KOREAN WAR IN 1950. CIVIL WAR IN CHINA CONTINUED FROM 1946 AND RESULTED IN THE KMT RETREATING TO TAIWAN IN 1949. THE COMMUNISTS WON THE MAINLAND. IN THE MIDDLE EAST THE ARAB DISAGREEMENT ON THE UNITED NATIONS PLAN TO CREATE ISRAEL MARKED THE BEGINNING OF CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE ARABS AND ISRAEL.
AFTER THE WAR DECOLONIZATION TOOK PLACE IN MANY EUROPEAN COLONIES. BAD ECONOMIES AND PEOPLE WANTING TO RULE THEMSELVES WERE THE MAIN REASONS FOR THAT. IN MOST CASES IT HAPPENED PEACEFULLY EXCEPT IN SOME COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDOCHINA AND ALGERIA. IN MANY REGIONS EUROPEAN WITHDRAWAL CAUSED DIVISIONS AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO HAD DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS OR RELIGIONS.
ECONOMIC RECOVERY WAS DIFFERENT IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD. IN GENERAL IT WAS QUITE POSITIVE. THE UNITED STATES BECAME RICHER THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY AND BY 1950 IT HAD TAKEN OVER THE WORLD S ECONOMY. IT ALSO ORDERED THE MARSHALL PLAN 1948 1951 TO HELP EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. GERMAN ITALIAN AND FRENCH ECONOMIES RECOVERED. HOWEVER THE BRITISH ECONOMY WAS BADLY HARMED AND CONTINUED TO WORSEN FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS. THE SOVIET ECONOMY GREW VERY FAST AFTER THE WAR WAS OVER. THIS ALSO HAPPENED WITH THE JAPANESE ECONOMY WHICH BECAME ONE OF THE LARGEST ECONOMIES IN THE 1980S. CHINA RETURNED TO THE SAME PRODUCTION LEVEL AS BEFORE THE WAR BY 1952.
THERE IS NO EXACT TOTAL NUMBER OF DEATHS BECAUSE MANY WERE UNRECORDED. MANY STUDIES SAID THAT MORE THAN 60 MILLION PEOPLE DIED IN THE WAR MOSTLY CIVILIANS. THE SOVIET UNION LOST AROUND 27 MILLION PEOPLE ALMOST HALF OF THE RECORDED NUMBER. THIS MEANS THAT 25 OF THE SOVIETS WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED IN THE WAR. ABOUT 85 OF THE TOTAL DEATHS WERE ON THE ALLIES SIDE AND THE OTHER 15 WERE ON THE AXIS. MOSTLY PEOPLE DIED BECAUSE THEY WERE SICK HUNGRY TO DEATH BOMBED OR KILLED BECAUSE OF THEIR ETHNICITY.
THE NAZIS KILLED MANY GROUPS OF PEOPLE THEY SELECTED KNOWN AS THE HOLOCAUST. THEY EXTERMINATED JEWS AND KILLED THE ROMA HOMOSEXUALS AND OTHER GROUPS. AROUND 11 TO 17 MILLION CIVILIANS DIED. AROUND 7.5 MILLION PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN CHINA BY THE JAPANESE. THE MOST WELL KNOWN JAPANESE CRIME IS THE NANKING MASSACRE IN WHICH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHINESE CIVILIANS WERE RAPED AND MURDERED. THERE WERE REPORTS THAT THE GERMANS AND JAPANESE TESTED BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS AGAINST CIVILIANS AND PRISONERS OF WAR.
ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE AXIS S CRIMES WERE BROUGHT TO THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL COURT CRIMES CAUSED BY THE ALLIES WERE NOT.
OTHER THAN THE HOLOCAUST ABOUT 12 MILLION PEOPLE MOSTLY EASTERN EUROPEANS WERE FORCED TO WORK FOR THE GERMAN ECONOMY. GERMAN CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND SOVIET GULAGS CAUSED A LOT OF DEATH. BOTH TREATED PRISONERS OF WAR BADLY. THIS WAS EVEN THE CASE FOR SOVIET SOLDIERS WHO SURVIVED AND RETURNED HOME.
JAPANESE PRISONER OF WAR CAMPS MANY OF WHICH WERE USED AS LABOUR CAMPS ALSO CAUSED A LOT OF DEATHS. THE DEATH RATE OF WESTERN PRISONERS WAS 27.1 SEVEN TIMES THAT OF PRISONERS UNDER GERMANS AND ITALIANS. MORE THAN 10 MILLION CHINESE CIVILIANS WERE MADE SLAVES AND HAD TO WORK IN MINES AND WAR FACTORIES. BETWEEN 4 AND 10 MILLION PEOPLE WERE FORCED TO WORK IN JAVA.
BETWEEN 1942 AND 1945 ROOSEVELT SIGNED AN ORDER WHICH MADE JAPANESE AMERICANS GO TO INTERNMENT CAMPS. SOME GERMANS AND ITALIANS WERE INCLUDED TOO.
THE ALLIES AGREED THAT THE SOVIET UNION COULD USE PRISONERS OF WAR AND CIVILIANS FOR FORCED LABOR. HUNGARIANS WERE FORCED TO WORK FOR THE SOVIET UNION UNTIL 1955.
BEFORE THE WAR IN EUROPE THE ALLIES HAD A LARGER POPULATION AND ECONOMY THAN THE AXIS. IF COLONIES ARE INCLUDED THE GDP OF THE ALLIES THEN WOULD BE TWO TIMES OF THAT OF THE AXIS. WHILE IN ASIA CHINA HAD ONLY 38 HIGHER GDP THAN THE JAPANESE IF THEIR COLONIES ARE COUNTED.
THE ALLIES ECONOMY AND POPULATION COMPARED WITH THE AXIS LESSENED WITH THE EARLY AXIS VICTORIES. HOWEVER THIS WAS NO LONGER THE CASE AFTER THE UNITED STATES AND SOVIET UNION JOINED THE ALLIES IN 1941. THE ALLIES WERE ABLE TO HAVE A HIGHER PRODUCTION LEVEL COMPARED WITH THE AXIS BECAUSE THE ALLIES HAD MORE NATURAL RESOURCES. ALSO GERMANY AND JAPAN DID NOT PLAN FOR A LONG WAR AND HAD NO ABILITY TO DO SO. BOTH TRIED TO IMPROVE THEIR ECONOMIES BY USING SLAVE LABORERS.
AS MEN WENT OFF TO FIGHT WOMEN TOOK OVER MANY OF THE JOBS THEY LEFT BEHIND. AT FACTORIES WOMEN WERE EMPLOYED TO MAKE BOMBS GUNS AIRCRAFT AND OTHER EQUIPMENT. IN BRITAIN THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WERE SENT TO WORK ON FARMS AS PART OF THE LAND ARMY. OTHERS FORMED THE WOMEN S ROYAL NAVAL SERVICE TO HELP WITH BUILDING AND REPAIRING SHIPS. EVEN PRINCESS ELIZABETH WHO LATER BECAME QUEEN ELIZABETH II WORKED AS A MECHANIC TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. BY 1945 SOME WEAPONS WERE MADE ALMOST ENTIRELY BY WOMEN.
IN THE BEGINNING WOMEN WERE RARELY USED IN THE LABOUR FORCES IN GERMANY AND JAPAN. HOWEVER ALLIED BOMBINGS AND GERMANY S CHANGE TO A WAR ECONOMY MADE WOMEN TAKE A GREATER PART.
IN BRITAIN WOMEN ALSO WORKED IN GATHERING INTELLIGENCE AT BLETCHLEY PARK AND OTHER PLACES. THE MASS EVACUATION OF CHILDREN ALSO HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF MOTHERS DURING THE WAR YEARS.
GERMANY HAD TWO DIFFERENT IDEAS OF HOW IT WOULD OCCUPY COUNTRIES. IN WESTERN NORTHERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE GERMANY SET ECONOMIC POLICIES WHICH WOULD MAKE IT RICH. DURING THE WAR THESE POLICIES BROUGHT AS MUCH AS 40 OF TOTAL GERMAN INCOME. IN THE EAST THE WAR WITH THE SOVIET UNION MEANT GERMANY COULD NOT USE THE LAND TO GAIN RESOURCES. THE NAZIS USED THEIR RACIAL POLICY AND MURDERED A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY THOUGHT NON HUMAN. THE RESISTANCE THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT GERMANY SECRETLY COULD NOT HARM THE NAZIS MUCH UNTIL 1943.
IN ASIA JAPAN CLAIMED TO FREE COLONISED ASIAN COUNTRIES FROM EUROPEAN COLONIAL POWERS. ALTHOUGH THEY WERE WELCOMED AT FIRST IN MANY TERRITORIES THEIR CRUEL ACTIONS TURNED THE OPINIONS AGAINST THEM WITHIN A SHORT TIME. DURING THE OCCUPATION JAPAN USED 4 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL LEFT BEHIND BY THE ALLIES AT THE WAR S END. BY 1943 IT WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE UP TO 50 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL IN THE DUTCH EAST INDIES. THIS WAS 76 OF ITS 1940 RATE.
THE WAR BROUGHT NEW METHODS FOR FUTURE WARS. THE AIR FORCES IMPROVED GREATLY IN FIELDS SUCH AS AIR TRANSPORT STRATEGIC BOMBING TO USE BOMBS TO DESTROY INDUSTRY AND MORALE AS WELL AS RADAR AND WEAPONS FOR DESTROYING AIRCRAFT. JET AIRCRAFT WERE DEVELOPED AND WOULD BE USED IN WORLDWIDE AIR FORCES.
AT SEA THE WAR FOCUSED ON USING AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND SUBMARINES. AIRCRAFT CARRIERS SOON REPLACED BATTLESHIPS. THE IMPORTANT REASON WAS THEY WERE CHEAPER. SUBMARINES A DEADLY WEAPON SINCE WORLD WAR I ALSO PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE WAR. THE BRITISH IMPROVED WEAPONS FOR DESTROYING SUBMARINES SUCH AS SONAR WHILE THE GERMANS IMPROVED SUBMARINE TACTICS.
THE STYLE OF WAR ON THE LAND CHANGED FROM WORLD WAR I TO BE MORE MOVEABLE. TANKS WHICH WERE USED TO SUPPORT INFANTRY CHANGED TO A PRIMARY WEAPON. THE TANK WAS IMPROVED IN SPEED ARMOUR AND FIREPOWER DURING THE WAR. AT THE START OF THE WAR MOST COMMANDERS THOUGHT THAT USING BETTER TANKS WAS THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT ENEMY TANKS. HOWEVER EARLY TANKS COULD HARM ARMOUR JUST A LITTLE. THE GERMAN IDEA TO AVOID LETTING TANKS FIGHT ONE ANOTHER MEANT TANKS FACING TANKS RARELY HAPPENED. THIS WAS A SUCCESSFUL TACTIC USED IN POLAND AND FRANCE. WAYS TO DESTROY TANKS ALSO IMPROVED. EVEN THOUGH VEHICLES BECAME MORE USED IN THE WAR INFANTRY REMAINED THE MAIN PART OF THE ARMY AND MOST EQUIPPED LIKE IN WORLD WAR I.
SUBMACHINE GUNS BECAME WIDELY USED. THEY WERE ESPECIALLY USED IN CITIES AND JUNGLES. THE ASSAULT RIFLE A GERMAN DEVELOPMENT COMBINING FEATURES OF THE RIFLE AND SUBMACHINE GUN BECAME THE MAIN WEAPON FOR MOST ARMIES AFTER THE WAR.
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDED BETTER ENCRYPTION FOR SECRET MESSAGES SUCH AS THE GERMAN ENIGMA. ANOTHER FEATURE OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE WAS THE USE OF DECEPTION ESPECIALLY BY THE ALLIES. OTHERS INCLUDE THE FIRST PROGRAMMABLE COMPUTERS MODERN MISSILES AND ROCKETS AND THE ATOMIC BOMBS.
WRITING
WRITING IS THE ACT OF RECORDING LANGUAGE ON A VISUAL MEDIUM USING A SET OF SYMBOLS. THE SYMBOLS MUST BE KNOWN TO OTHERS SO THAT THE TEXT MAY BE READ.
A TEXT MAY ALSO USE OTHER VISUAL SYSTEMS SUCH AS ILLUSTRATIONS AND DECORATIONS. THESE ARE NOT CALLED WRITING BUT MAY HELP THE MESSAGE WORK. USUALLY ALL EDUCATED PEOPLE IN A COUNTRY USE THE SAME WRITING SYSTEM TO RECORD THE SAME LANGUAGE. TO BE ABLE TO READ AND WRITE IS TO BE LITERATE.
WRITING DIFFERS FROM SPEECH BECAUSE THE READERS NEED NOT BE PRESENT AT THE TIME. WE CAN READ WRITING FROM LONG AGO AND FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD. TEXT STORES AND COMMUNICATES KNOWLEDGE. WRITING IS ONE OF THE GREATEST INVENTIONS OF THE HUMAN SPECIES. IT WAS INVENTED AFTER PEOPLE SETTLED IN TOWNS AND AFTER AGRICULTURE STARTED. WRITING DATES FROM ABOUT 3 300 WHICH IS OVER 5000 YEARS AGO IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
WRITING TODAY IS USUALLY ON PAPER THOUGH THERE ARE WAYS TO PRINT ON ALMOST ANY SURFACE. TELEVISION AND MOVIE SCREENS CAN ALSO DISPLAY WRITING AND SO CAN COMPUTER SCREENS. MANY WRITING MATERIALS WERE INVENTED LONG BEFORE PAPER. CLAY PAPYRUS WOOD SLATE AND PARCHMENT PREPARED ANIMAL SKINS HAVE ALL BEEN USED. THE ROMANS WROTE ON WAXED TABLETS WITH A POINTED STYLUS THIS WAS POPULAR FOR TEMPORARY NOTES AND MESSAGES. THE LATER INVENTION OF PAPER BY THE CHINESE WAS A BIG STEP FORWARD.
WRITING IS TRADITIONALLY DONE USING A HAND TOOL SUCH AS A PENCIL A PEN OR A BRUSH. MORE AND MORE HOWEVER TEXT IS CREATED BY INPUT ON A COMPUTER KEYBOARD.
THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT 
THEREFORE DEPENDING ON AN AUTHOR S DEFINITION OF WRITING THE TERM MAY BE USED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. WITH MANY EARLY SYSTEMS WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY DO CONVEY. THE CENTRAL IDEA IS THAT A FULL WRITING SYSTEM MUST BE ABLE TO REPRESENT ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE SAID IN SPOKEN LANGUAGE. FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW THE INVENTION OF THE REBUS IS AN ESSENTIAL STEP.
WE CAN ONLY BE SURE A SIGN SYSTEM IS FULL WRITING IF WE CAN TRANSLATE THE SYMBOLS INTO A MODERN LANGUAGE. IN THE CASE OF SOME ANCIENT SCRIPTS WE CANNOT DO THIS.
WRITING WAS INVENTED INDEPENDENTLY A NUMBER OF TIMES. THE SUMERIAN THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN THE CHINESE AND THE MAYAN WRITINGS ARE SEPARATE IN THEIR INVENTION. ALL THESE WRITING SYSTEMS STARTED WITH PICTOGRAPHS SYMBOLS THAT STOOD FOR THINGS. THEN THEY DEVELOPED A MIXTURE OF METHODS. OUR OWN ALPHABETIC SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT. IT IS BASED ON THE SOUNDS OF SPOKEN LANGUAGE. ALL ALPHABETS ARE MODIFIED VERSIONS OF THE FIRST ONE WHICH ORIGINATED WITH THE PHOENICIANS AND THE ANCIENT GREEKS.
THE SUMERIANS LIVED IN MESOPOTAMIA BETWEEN THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES RIVERS. 5000 YEARS AGO THIS WAS A FERTILE REGION AND IS NOW MOSTLY IN IRAQ. THE SUMERIANS DEVELOPED A FORM OF WRITING CALLED CUNEIFORM. TRIANGULAR MARKS WERE PRESSED INTO SOFT CLAY TABLETS. AFTER THE CLAY HAD DRIED IN THE SUN THE TABLETS WERE BAKED. THEN THEY WERE CARRIED SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR OTHERS TO READ. WE KNOW THAT ITS FIRST USES WERE FOR TRADE ACCOUNTING AND ADMINISTRATION.
THE EARLIEST SIGNS WERE MOSTLY PICTORIAL BUT SOON THEY STOOD AS SYMBOLS FOR OBJECTS IDEAS AND SOUNDS. THIS WRITING SYSTEM WAS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL AND OUTLASTED THE SUMERIAN EMPIRE. IT WAS THEN USED BY OTHER CIVILISATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST SUCH AS THE OLD 
AKKADIAN BABYLONIAN ASSYRIAN ELAMITE HITTITE OLD PERSIAN AND UGARITIC EMPIRES. THE LAST CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTION WAS DATED AS 75. THUS THE SYSTEM HAD LASTED FOR MORE THAN 3000 YEARS. EACH VERSION OF CUNEIFORM HAD TO BE DECIPHERED SEPARATELY BECAUSE ALL THE LANGUAGES WERE DIFFERENT. DOCUMENTS INCLUDING STONE OBJECTS WRITTEN IN MORE THAN ONE LANGUAGE PROVIDED THE CLUES.
THIS IS THE MOST FAMOUS OF THE OLD FORMS OF WRITING OR SCRIPTS. IT WAS INVENTED AT ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME AS CUNEIFORM YET WAS QUITE DIFFERENT IN STYLE AND USED DIFFERENT MATERIALS. EGYPTIANS ENDED UP WITH THREE WRITING SYSTEMS FOR THE SAME LANGUAGE. THEY WERE 
THE WRITING TOOLS USED VARIED ACCORDING TO THE MATERIAL WHICH WAS WRITTEN ON. THE TWO CURSIVE SCRIPTS WERE WRITTEN WITH REED PENS AND CARBON INKS ONTO PAPYRUS. IF THE MATERIAL WAS CLOTH THEN THE WRITING WAS DONE BY A BRUSH. MANY EXAMPLES SURVIVE. THE HIEROGLYPHS WERE INSCRIBED CARVED INTO STONE HAMMER CHISEL OR PAINTED ONTO STONE SURFACES. MANY SURVIVE SOME WITH THE ORIGINAL COLOURS INTACT. THE KEY EVENT IN THE DECIPHERMENT OF HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING WAS THE DISCOVERY OF THE ROSETTA STONE. THIS IS A GRANITE SLAB WITH THE SAME MESSAGE WRITTEN IN HIEROGLYPHIC DEMOTIC AND IN GREEK. ANCIENT GREEK IS WELL UNDERSTOOD AND MADE POSSIBLE THE INTERPRETATION OF THE OTHER TWO SCRIPTS.
CHINESE IS THE LANGUAGE WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF NATIVE SPEAKERS. ITS HISTORY DATES BACK TO ABOUT 1400. THE CHINESE WRITING SYSTEM IS IDIO SYLLABIC A MIXED METHOD USING CHARACTERS WHICH MAY HAVE ONE OR MORE OF THESE ELEMENTS 
CHINESE HAS A HUGE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN THE REGION OF 50 000. BECAUSE OF THIS PRINTING METHODS WERE NEVER REALLY SUCCESSFUL IN CHINA DESPITE THEIR EARLY INVENTION. IN THE 14TH CENTURY WANG TZHEN HAD SIXTY THOUSAND WOOD BLOCK CHARACTERS CUT A HUGE INVESTMENT IN TIME AND MONEY. HE PRINTED 100 COPIES OF A LOCAL GAZETTE AND WAS AUTHOR OF A TREATISE ON AGRICULTURE AND OTHER TECHNICAL WORKS. EVEN WITH PRINTING MACHINES FROM EUROPE IN THE 19TH CENTURY THE PROCESS WAS HAMPERED BY THE HUGE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS WHICH SLOWED THE COMPOSITION TO A SNAIL S PACE.
CHINA HAS EIGHT REGIONAL LANGUAGES THAT ARE MUTUALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE AND MANY TRUE DIALECTS. THE SYSTEM APPEARS TO WORK MAINLY BECAUSE AS MANY AS 70 SPEAK MANDARIN. FLUENCY IN CHINESE READING AND WRITING IS UNDOUBTEDLY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE AND THIS MUST ACT AS A BRAKE ON THE DRIVE FOR LITERACY. THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS TO REFORM OR SIMPLIFY THE SYSTEM. THE MOST RADICAL IN PINYIN WHICH IS A PROGRAM TO REPLACE CHINESE CHARACTERS WITH AN ALPHABETIC SYSTEM. THIS WAS SUPPORTED BY MAO BUT FALTERED AFTER HIS DEATH.
IT SEEMS THAT THE IDEA OF AN ALPHABET A SCRIPT BASED ENTIRELY UPON SOUND AROSE ONLY ONCE AND HAS BEEN COPIED AND ADAPTED TO SUIT MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. ALTHOUGH NO ALPHABET FITS ITS LANGUAGE PERFECTLY IT IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO FIT ANY LANGUAGE APPROXIMATELY. IT WAS A UNIQUE INVENTION.
OUR ALPHABET IS CALLED THE ROMAN ALPHABET AS COMPARED WITH THE CYRILLIC AND OTHER ALPHABETS. ALL OF THESE COME FROM THE ANCIENT GREEK ALPHABET WHICH DATES BACK TO ABOUT 1100 TO 800. THE GREEK ALPHABET WAS PROBABLY DEVELOPED FROM THE PHOENICIAN SCRIPT WHICH APPEARED SOMEWHAT EARLIER AND HAD SOME SIMILAR LETTER SHAPES.
THE PHOENICIAN LANGUAGE WAS A SEMITIC LANGUAGE OFTEN CALLED CANAANITE. THE SEMITIC GROUP OF LANGUAGES INCLUDES ARABIC MALTESE HEBREW AND ALSO ARAMAIC THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN BY JESUS. WE DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT HOW THE ALPHABETIC IDEA AROSE BUT THE PHOENICIANS A TRADING PEOPLE CAME UP WITH LETTERS WHICH WERE ADAPTED BY THE EARLY GREEKS TO PRODUCE THEIR ALPHABET. THE ONE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE PHOENICIAN SCRIPT HAD NO PURE VOWELS. ARABIC SCRIPT HAS VOWELS WHICH MAY BE SHOWN BY DIACRITICS SMALL MARKS ABOVE OR BELOW THE LINE. THE OLDEST QU RAN MANUSCRIPTS HAD NO DIACRITICS. ISRAELI CHILDREN TODAY USE TEXTS WITH VOWEL DOTS ADDED TO ABOUT THE THIRD GRADE.
NO ANCIENT SCRIPT ALPHABETIC OR NOT HAD PURE VOWELS BEFORE THE GREEKS. THE GREEK ALPHABET EVEN HAS TWO VOWELS FOR E AND TWO FOR O TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE LONG AND SHORT SOUNDS. IT IS FAIRLY CLEAR FROM THIS THAT CAREFUL THOUGHT WENT INTO BOTH THE PHOENICIAN INVENTION AND THE GREEK ADAPTATION. HOWEVER NO DETAILS SURVIVE OF EITHER PROCESS.
SEMITIC SCRIPTS APPARENTLY DERIVE FROM PROTO SINAITIC A SCRIPT OF WHICH ONLY 31 INSCRIPTIONS PLUS 17 DOUBTFUL ARE KNOWN. IT IS THOUGHT BY SOME RESEARCHERS THAT THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THIS SCRIPT WAS THE EGYPTIAN HIERATIC SCRIPT. BY THE LATE MIDDLE KINGDOM ABOUT 1900 HIERATIC HAD ADDED SOME ALPHABETIC SIGNS FOR REPRESENTING THE CONSONANTS OF FOREIGN NAMES. EGYPTIAN ACTIVITY IN SINAI WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AT THAT TIME. A SIMILAR IDEA HAD BEEN SUGGESTED MANY YEARS BEFORE.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SCRIPTS WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN DECIPHERED DESPITE MUCH EFFORT. PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS ARE THE SCRIPT OF THE INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION AND ETRUSCAN. THE INDUS RIVER CIVILISATION PREDATES OTHER LITERATE CIVILISATIONS ON THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT GOING BACK TO ABOUT 2500. THEIR CITIES OF MOHENJO DARU AND HARAPPA WERE WELL PLANNED WITH GOOD DRAINAGE. THE SCRIPT IS FOUND ON SEAL STONES TERRACOTTA BRONZE BONE AND IVORY. ALL ARE BRIEF AND THE LANGUAGE IS UNKNOWN.
THE ETRUSCAN LANGUAGE USED GREEK LETTER FORMS AND IS FOUND MAINLY ON ETRUSCAN TOMBS FROM TUSCANY THROUGH TO VENICE. THEY WERE AN EMPIRE BEFORE THE ROMANS WHO DEFEATED THEM AND ABSORBED THEIR IDEAS. ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR LANGUAGE WAS LOST EXCEPT THAT SOME OF THE NAMES ON TOMB MEMORIALS CAN BE READ FROM THE GREEK LETTERS.
THE T RT RIA TABLETS ARE THREE TABLETS DISCOVERED IN 1961 IN THE VILLAGE OF T RT RIA HUNGARIAN ALS TAT RLAKA. THIS IS ABOUT FROM ALBA IULIA IN ROMANIA. THE TABLETS DATED TO AROUND 5300 BC HAVE SYMBOLS IN CLAY THE VIN A SYMBOLS. SOME CLAIM THEY ARE A YET UNDECIPHERED LANGUAGE. IF THIS IS SO THEY WOULD BE THE EARLIEST KNOWN FORM OF WRITING. IN 1908 SIMILAR SYMBOLS WERE FOUND DURING EXCAVATIONS BY MILOJE VASI 1869 1956 IN VIN A. THIS IS A SUBURB OF BELGRADE SERBIA SOME 300 KM FROM TURDA. LATER MORE WERE FOUND IN ANOTHER PART OF BELGRADE. SINCE 1875 OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY VIN A SITES HAVE BEEN FOUND IN SERBIA ALONE. MANY INCLUDING VIN A ITSELF HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY EXCAVATED. THE CULTURE OF THE WHOLE AREA IS CALLED THE VIN A CULTURE. ALTHOUGH SOME OF THESE SYMBOLS LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME AS SOME LETTERS IN ETRUSCAN GREEK AND ARAMAIC THEY ARE GENERALLY REGARDED AS AN ORIGINAL INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT.
IT IS ONLY IN THE LAST 150 YEARS THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO READ AND WRITE IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA. IN MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD THIS DID NOT HAPPEN UNTIL THE 20TH CENTURY. UNTIL THEN LITERACY WAS MAINLY FOR CLERICS THAT IS PEOPLE WHO HAD TRAINING AS PRIESTS. EVEN WEALTHY PEOPLE WERE OFTEN ILLITERATE AND USED SCRIBES TO WRITE FOR THEM. THE INVENTION OF PRINTING CAME BEFORE MASS LITERACY. BEFORE 1500 EACH BOOK HAD TO BE CREATED BY HAND SO THERE WERE FEW BOOKS AVAILABLE COMPARED TO THE BILLIONS IN THE WORLD TODAY. MASS LITERACY NEEDED CHEAP BOOKS.
EVEN NOW THERE IS STILL WIDESPREAD ILLITERACY.
THE ORDINARY USE OF WRITING BY MEANS OF A PEN AND PAPER. CAN REFER TO WRITING FOR ONESELF AS IN A DIARY BUT MOSTLY IT REFERS TO SENDING LETTERS. ONCE IT WAS ALMOST THE ONLY MEANS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO WERE SEPARATED. NOW THE TELEPHONE AND E MAIL ARE THE MOST COMMON MEANS OF DISTANCE COMMUNICATION.
